"""The Good Side""

I got the good side of things
 Left you with both of the rings
 My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
 The change in the wind took you down to your knees
 I got the good side of you
 Send it out into the blue
 The people danced to the sound of your heart
 The world sang along to it falling apart

 But I sympathize
 And I recognize
 And baby, I apologize
 That I got the good side
 The good side of things

 I got the good side of life
 Travelled the universe twice
 So many thoughts I wanted to share
 But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
 Then I got the good side of new
 Found arms to fall right into
 I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
 And some day I hope that you'll understand

 That I sympathize
 And I recognize
 And baby, I apologize
 That I got the good side
 The good side of things

 I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
 And catch up on everything
 I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
 You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

 But I sympathize
 And I recognize
 And baby, I apologize
 That I got the good side
 The good side of things
 Sympathize
 Recognize
 Apologize
 That I got the good side
 The good side of things

"LOVE this song <3 

I'm so going to get hate for this, but everyone mentioning Connor in the comments .. I think it's f----ng rude and disrespectful towards both Troye & Connor to assume how this song just HAS to be for Connor just because people ship them together and can't see it being for anyone else. 'Oh, I ship Tronnor so this song must definitely for Connor' is basically what I'm seeing here in the comments. 

People, please. Don't pretend to know it MUST be a song for Connor just because you ship an unconfirmed relationship (had it been real, no doubt it would have been public knowledge by now).  It could be for ANY boyfriend Troye's had, someone we probably don't even know. 

Before any single one of you start the hate comments: former Tronnor shipper here. Moved on to #Tracob, it's not even worth it to keep up the wishful thinking. So, yep. Can't wait to be hated on for this ..üôÑ",-0.9169,186

"So, Troye broke up with Connor & then began very quickly dating a male model, Jacob? This song raises as many questions as it answers. Did Troye cheat on Connor? Did Troye go Hollywood on us? Sad that we don‚Äôt know him like we used to. I used to think of him as just a regular person on YouTube & now I feel like he‚Äôs this guarded person, kind of above us. I think that happened to a lot of the 1st/2nd generation YouTubers. At least we still have the nostalgic 2013 & 2014 vids.",-0.6926,112
