Snapchat seems to be mistaking this as people whining about the social media content pushers not being personal anymore, where I don't think that is really the majority of people's main concern is.
The big thing though is that their UX has been terrible throughout + the camera, as you said, on Android makes it a selective platform + the new update making it more confusing = suicide.",-0.918,122

"Snapchat on Android has worse camera quality, simply because snapchat doesn't use proper API's.
That translates to the issue that snapchat only takes a screenshot of what is on the screen, instead of using the actual camera to take the picture.

For example if you have android phone that has 21 megapixel camera and 1080p screen, then snapchat only takes 1080p pictures with that phone.

Edit: commented bit too early.
There being so many different android devices and only few iPhones has almost nothing to do with this.

Yes testing with every iPhone model would be easy to do, where on Android side it would be only feasible to do so with maybe only with Samsung's, sony's, LG's and Google's current and one year older flagships.

But that's where those API's come in the play.
If you make your app target to that camera API, it will most likely work just fine.
Because of this you don't need to code snapchat for every single android device out there, if you have made it right then if it does not work, then it is most likely that phone/manufacturer that has not made proper camera API's.",0.729,215
