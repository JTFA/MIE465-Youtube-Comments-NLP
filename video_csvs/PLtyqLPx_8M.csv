"Do you know that Italian playing at 2002 world cup was very dirty and poor. The looser players didn't want to be blame about the result that Italy lose by Asian country in World-cup. Emma! Why don't you look the match carefully and say that. I think you have big stereotype and you are not honesty. Why Asian must lose against Italia every matching?  Why they did't score more goals with the talented skill in the game.  Don't excuse and have honesty. I am sure Italiano (or Some Japanese, Chinese to yearn Italy) who insult Korean for the matching the 2002 worldcup is most shameless people in the world.",-0.9625,121

"Watch the game. In every game where Chinese players are penalized, Chinese players have used their hands to interfere with players from other countries. Why does this ruling undermine the Olympic spirit? There have been many indications that Chinese players are using their hands on short tracks. Nevertheless, China has taught its players how to use their hands and is being thoroughly pointed out at this Olympic Games. 'freedom' is not like 'lawlessness'.",-0.3839,85
