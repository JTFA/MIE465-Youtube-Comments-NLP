"1 Corinthians 6:9-11
9. Or do you not know that the UNrighteous will ""NOT"" inherit the kingdom of God ?

      Do not be deceived:
neither the sexually immoral,
nor fornicators,
nor idolaters,
nor adulterers, 
nor homosexuals,
nor thieves,
nor sodomites,
nor covetious,
nor drunkards,
nor revilers, 
nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.

11.  And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified,  but you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of God.

        All must REPENT from Sin to enter thy kingdom.
        Jesus Christ is the ""Only"" way to the Father in Heaven.",0.8662,131
