I just met someone from far away. They create a peaceful quiet for me every time I talk to them. My life is a mess and it all goes away temporarily when their voice is there.

I think how u interpret this song tells a lot about your current situation like if someone has broken up with you or hurt you . You understand it as show me where your love lies( where your love is untruthful) but if you are in the puppy love stage or if you are crushing you think about it as show me where your love lies( do you love me a lot of is this temporary),0.9631,80
