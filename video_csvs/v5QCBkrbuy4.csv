"50+ years of scripted finishes and 0 black WWE champions. There have been 2 black world heavyweight champions - Mark Henry and King Booker (T). However, this was a 2nd tier title at the time. There were also 2 black (WWE version) ECW champions, Lashley and Ezekiel Jackson. Jackson held the title for less than a day before it was dissolved and Lashley lost his title to Vince himself before going to become the top guy in TNA/Impact/GFW.

Note: find audio/video of the WWE actively calling the Rock the 1st black WWE champion and I'll retract my comment. Interesting enough, you can find commentary of the WWE promoting the Undertaker v Farooq match as having the potential of crowning the first black WWE Champion in history (he lost).
