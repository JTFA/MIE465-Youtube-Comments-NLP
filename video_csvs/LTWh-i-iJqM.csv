You know there's got to be a final lightsaber duel in episode 9, and Snoke does not seem to be a mobile character. I think (and I know this is probably wrong all the same) Kylo stays evil, together with Rey they kill Snoke, Rey turns to the dark side because she is from Palatines bloodline and that's why she was left alone, and Finn is the last Jedi. Setting up Luke having to face is old apprentice, and Finn having to face a dear 'friend' in Rey. If not this theory, I think there will be some new type of force user thing going on. Not a Jedi, not a SIth, somewhere in the middle, perhaps Luke's muted colored attire speaks to this already.",-0.9403,177
