"#PamelaCornelius -- no stone un-turned. Just because someone has lots of viewers and likes dogs doesn't mean she hypothetically didn't do it. What we do know is she, the other Carolyn, has a YouTube channel. Competition can motivate people to do crazy and cruel things. I'm an actor here in Hollywood, and I've seen some of my celebrity friends/colleagues do and say insane things to each other because there is that tension (greed, wanting work for themselves, etc.). NO STONE UN-TURNED!!!",-0.8959,100

I was watching Scott & Teri's video and looked at the side and saw this stopped watching theres and went to yours right away , and have been looking for yours every day since it happened because it happened to us in New Brunswick but a guy next to us seen my cat get out so we got her back .

Any thing is possible!! Many years ago I had a cockatiel! His wings where not clipped! I had him for years and he was so friendly and quit the character! I would let him out of the cage so he could play!! One day a friend came in and out the door Franky flew! I asked everyone if they saw my bird!! I looked and looked and looked! After 5 days I gave up! I knew even if I saw him how could I catch him! Two days later a group of 5 school young kids knocked on my door and said I know where your bird is!! Where?? He's in a tree behind my house!! Someone had told me to take his cage and if he sees it he might fly to it!! So here I go carrying this big cage half a mile down the road following these kids! I get to the tree and sure enough there in the tree 20 ft up is my Franky! I put the cage it was white on the ground opened the door and we all watched in amazement as he flew down to the ground and climbed into the cage !! I thanked the kids and gave them all a reward!! I clipped his wings and he lived a long happy life!! No matter what happens at least you can say to yourself I have done everything I can to find her so you can have peace of mind!!,0.9834,279

"Carolyn, you were a police officer. Don't you find it too suspicious this Carolyn's RV Life spotted a cat at Albertson's? Was she at RTR? Is it possible she took Kit-Ten from your van out of envy (envy over your channel & friendships)? Perhaps her guilt is now getting to her. Maybe she followed you out of RTR, and when no one was around took your beloved cat? As we have seen (e.g. Eric being stalked in Florida), there are some people of questionable character out there. Moreover, you were posting videos within a period of time that it ""could"" make it easy for someone to locate you. I'm sorry if this sounds so brazen, but my gut instinct tells me you wouldn't make the mistake of letting Kit-Ten get out.",0.343,154

"Hi again Carolyn.  I'm checking out now as it's super late here.  I have asked Karen Peterson to reply to you directly on this thread (the lady who left a comment on this video about there being a lost cat at the Women's RTR Meeting who was taken to a shelter in Quartsite).  

She didn't know much more than that,  but I think it's worth a shot.  She said that two women were going around asking if anyone had lost a cat and that everyone said no, so they were going to take the animal to a shelter in Quartsite. If she replies to you here it will save you having to wade through the hundreds of comments to find her. 

I know you believe Kitten got out of the van in Blythe, but it seems an awful coincidence that this report is from around the same time. Plus she might likely have been more relaxed about somehow sneaking out at the RTR location, rather than at a busy shopping district. Might be worth checking out vets' offices and animal shelters in Quartsite area again, just in case.

I really hope as evening falls and things quieten down, that little fur ball will reappear. I have three of my own  -  I know how you feel.  I have sat and cried a few times when they've gone AWOL  - but they've always come back.  Even pampered domestic cats know how to survive.  Take it easy and be careful out there.",0.8116,273

"Take some clothing that you use or a fabric that you make contact with regularly and leave it at each place you went that day. Speak to the local shops and ask can you leave it there. Leave your social media address with each piece of material and some of her food. Take a disposable tin and place a bit of her used litter near the articles. Get your friend to stay at one location and you stay at another location. Switch up where you stay and be a crazy cat lady and call her name during the day and at night. A cat will hide for a few days until it gets really hungry. Hope you don't give up until you've used every resource you have and pray, pray, pray.",0.8214,141

"Though I feel bad for you, it is incredibly irresponsible of you to let her loose all the time. What did you think was eventually going to happen? In you interview with RTR Bob, you said you had a harness for her. Put it on. That's what it was for! As a rescue and ""re homer""  this happens all the time and it is frustrating for people like me who have found homes for hundreds of felines who have  escaped.  Peopke think they can find their way back. You, especially,  should have known better since you are always on the move, she had no home territory.  Best of luck, I wish I didn't live clear across the country or I would be there to help you. THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS STRAY CATS IN AMERICA. People, use harnesses, take EXTRA care. GOD BLESS YOU AND I HOPE YOU FIND YOUR FRIEND.",0.9734,172

any rvers near the town where you lost her could help maybe. you could list or tell us all the stores that you went to that day.
