"Yes the Eagles offense played terrible especially Foles, but I still believe Foles can play better and play good enough through the playoffs. The run game has to and I mean HAVE TO step up, Ajayi is very good but has to play better if we want to make a deep playoff run, Blount is good but very slow and is stopped right away 95 % of the time, and I wish Clement played more. The receivers have to get open more to help Foles, not everything was Foles fault. I hope the defense can play as good as they did in this game, they are the reason we won this game.

In summary the offense has to step up big time, Foles, the rbs and wrs. The defense has to continue to play well. And special teams, keep doing your thing. If all that happens (It probably won‚Äôt but I can hope) we can make a deep playoff run. FLY EAGLES FLY!!!!",0.9962,187
