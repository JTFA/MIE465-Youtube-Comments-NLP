"assistant professor vs professor is different, please be accurate. and also, seriously, 5-8x the body weight? did you even think before you speak, assistant professor? 5-8x the body weight means 5-8G - for reference, rocket launch usually is around 3G. Another way to put it, if someone can land with 5-8x the body weight, then F = ma = (5)*45 (i'm assuming low end of 5x the body weight, and 45kg of a light female skater), that's F = 225N. Convert that back to body weight, that's equivalent of squatting 225kg (495lb) on a single leg. ANOTHER way to think about it, you get back what you output (in physics pretty much, minus some loss to frictions and etc, it should actually be lower). So to land with 5-8x the body weight means the skater need to be able to output a force of 5-8x the body weight. Seriously, if someone thought about that statement, you would realize it's wrong.",-0.5803,200
