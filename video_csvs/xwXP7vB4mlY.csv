"I can tell you that my friend went few weeks later again and then the midwife asked if she wanted to know the gender and my friend is one of those who can't wait so she told her. My friend already had child and that was a boy so when she heard she was expecting another boy she was happy thinking ""nice my son will have a playmate"" but she actually didn't care if it was boy or a girl. She never asked again because I don't think anyone does that after they have been told the gender in about 19th week. Then the delivery day came and she gave birth to a girl lol, the girl part just looked on sonar like it was boy. So it actually doesn't matter what that woman told you it will be revealed when you guys reache delivery 😊 but every time my friend went for checkups the heartbeat told different story, with her boy the heartbeat was around 140 but this time always way more like around 160 so what does this time the heartbeat tell you 140 or 160?",0.9612,197
