Its a shame when Michael was alive most celebrities steered clear of the subject thinking the association with him would compromise their careers. Yet after 6/25/09, everyone has a cool story to tell about MJ. Where were you when he desperately needed support & a friend??And the media is twice as bad. They manipulated stories about him throughout his career yet again, after that day in June 2009, the world has lost a misunderstood & musical genius. Funny how on 6/24/09 he was a washed up drug addict, turned surgically enhanced freak that changed his race & face because he despised his own. And lets not forget the pedophilia that he was aquitted of ALL charges in a criminal case but still found absolutely guilty in the court of public opinion. I cant think of a better example of..""What a difference a day makes""!! IMO when other celebrities tell these stories about him I'm left wondering as to why...more importantly, why now?? Hes been gone now for almost a decade. Are the rest of us suppose to be impressed that you are still name dropping him? Regardless of what their intention is all I see is one more selfish celebrity who was more worried about their career & connection with MJ & if it could possibly do harm to them back then. But now that hes gone & the rest of world is looking at him in a different light its cool once again to do or say anything that associates you with him personally. They're celebrities, you'd think they'd have something to say about their own career & projects so why do they keep bringing up Michael in these interview so far after the fact??? #FAMOUS HYPOCRITES",-0.9618,326
