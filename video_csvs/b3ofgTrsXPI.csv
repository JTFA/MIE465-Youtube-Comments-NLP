"*put camera on ground*
*go back inside*
*walk back outside*
*pick camera up*
*put camera near car*
*walk back to door*
*walk around camera*
*go back to camera*
*pick camera up*
*walk around car to other side* 
*put camera down*
*walk back around to first side of car*
*walk around car again*

It's so smooth but just thinking about this process for every cool sequence makes me giggle. This must take patience. Especially for how often it seems to be used. Plus drones, its like...

*stop car*
*fly drone*
*tell driver to go*
*film car*
*tell driver to stop*
*land drone*
*get back in car*

And then going to the airport...

*exit car in parking garage*
*put camera on ground*
*get back in car*
*get out of car*
*walk past camera*
*walk back to camera*
*pick up camera*
*walk towards parking garage exit*
*put camera down*
*walk back 50 feet*
*walk past camera*
*go back to camera*
*pick up camera*
*...repeat process all the way to gate*

"Best . Video . Ever !!    Seriously, this vid made me cry ... not from the lemon, but because it hits very close to home.  I was diagnosed with AML (acute myoblastic leukemia) in January, 1992 ... six weeks after having been diagnosed with full blown AIDS.  I was living in Los Angeles at the time, and my Oncologist began the process of arranging a bone marrow transplant.  After contacting a major bone marrow transplant organization (who shall remain nameless), my physician informed me that they denied accepting me as a viable candidate because, with my AIDS diagnosis, I was not considered worth the time, effort, or $$$ required.  Thankfully, my doctor was tenacious, resourceful, and brilliant enough to develop an alternative treatment regimen that was aggressive enough to eventually bring my leukemia to a state of remission.  26 years later I am still here, still fighting, and still alive because someone cared.  Thank you, Peter, and Casey, and everyone else participating in this campaign to raise awareness of bone marrow donation ... Your support to those in need is priceless ❤️",0.9766,213
