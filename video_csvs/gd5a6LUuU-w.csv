"Tom Thum I've been listening for quite a while and I always come back. Your talent is very cool and the way you've learned to use your beatboxing to entertain people, whereas it used to be a very niche battling skill. Please keep making these videos even if they're not extremely exploitable. I think in songs like wayfaring stranger you actually have quite a good singing voice too. Perhaps you could dip a little into mainstream with a great beat (pre-made) and you sing on it with an original text. I truely wish you all the succes in the world.",0.9657,109
