Seems like there is alot of pop-fans on this channel who seems outraged that their favourite music artists got snubbed. But don't discredit and tear down the artists that are nominated because your favourite artist didn't get nominated. People who even haven't listened to Jay-Z album are saying he don't deserve it. Like c'mon man just because you don't like rap don't mean he don't deserve the nomination. And shoutout to Kendrick for the nominations.,-0.5588,80

"So an EP by Coldplay gets nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album but Harry Styles' album doesn't? Since when were fucking EP's eligible at the grammys? Jay-Z for AOTY? Sure, why not. But for ROTT and SOTY? Never, not even on Mars. 

Who/What I think SHOULD win:
AOTY: Melodrama or 24K. Melodrama meets and exceeds EVERY requirement an album exactly needs. 24K is underrated AF. People don't realize that R&B is disappearing, while hip hop and trap is rising. The fact that he was able to pull it off in 20 fucking 17 says how good his album is. 

SOTY: Despacito or That's What I Like. Yes, despacito was everywhere. But whether you like the song or not, this song started the trend in the pop music scene. Artists now are doing the same thinf after they saw the success of Despacito on the charts (16 fucking weeks at #1). That's What I Like is exactly the perfect song to win this category, aside from Despacito. It has the perfect blend of pop and R&B magic. 

ROTY: Humble or Redbone or 24K. Humble is catchy and a fun rap song. The perfect song for radioplay. Redbone is just...AMAZING. 24K is one of my favorite Bruno Mars' songs, so this is just a personal choice of mine. 

Best Pop Vocal Album: Rainbow or Joanne or ÷.
Rainbow gives a storytelling kinda vibe. As if Kesha is reflecting on her experiences in this album. Not to mention, her vocals on this album were SPOT ON. Joanne had so much genres involved, and I find it amazing how she was able to pull them all off in one album. Same thing for divide as well. Although he was only using a guitar mostly on this album, his songwriting gives the album something special. 

That's all. LOL",0.9981,361

"We all know Terminal Redux is the real album of the year, let's be honest.",0.5106,17
"Well this is kinda bittersweet. But here is my take on things.
1. It is suppose to be a balance between ""talent"" and still be able to bring in ratings. 
2. I'm happy for childish gambino, SZA, and kesha receving some love for their work. Personally, I think Ctrl or Rainbow should replace 4:44 and 24k for album of the year but i will take the nominations that they got. Also happy for Khalid and Gaga, who I think should have gotten more nominations..
3. In my opinion the only category that really got it good was the best new artist category. That is a lot of talent that I think deserves it. I hope SZA gets it though. That whole record is amazing.
4. Shockers to me were Julia getting song of the year. That was surprising. And Ed only got two nominations? I thought he would have gotten more but in all honesty, I'm happy they gave those nominations to artist's that (in my opinion) put out better music that was just better, not just more popular.
5. Snubbed: Demi could have gotten something for best pop vocal album. I mean I know the pop category is tough and they have to bring down 15+ pop records and narrow down to five or six but still, I think Demi's album is better than Coldplay's album and to some extent, ed Sheeran's album, so I feel that was a snub. Also, moving Imagine Dragons to the pop category doesn't help. Kelly Clarkson put out a really great album, and was able to get a nomination, yet harry, demi, and sam smith were all robbed. Overall, though the pop category is tough. You can't say ""this person should be nominated,"" you have to say ""who doesn't deserve to be there?"" Or ""whose album is better than one of the other nominees?"" For me, replace ed sheeran or coldplay with demi and kelly clarkson and you have a pretty awesome list. 
And I think it's going to be really ironic that the top nine nominated people are black, yet there is a really good chance that the one white woman (lorde) will win album of the year. That would be a huge blowout. Melodrama is insanely good. Anyways good luck to all the nominees! I'm rooting for Gaga, Kesha, Childish Gambino, and SZA.",0.9984,459

"k bitch  Have you actually listened to jay z or beyonce's latest projects before you actually gave your opinion. Beyonce's lemonade album was the best selling album globally in 2016. Her album had 8 different musical genres, visuals, poems and adressed current political issues all while incorporating some of her own personal struggles yet it earned her only 2 grammys. Jay z's album though it wasn't as successful as beyonce's, also adressed different issues and was lyrically far superior than any pop songs released this year. The grammys actually try to balance quality and quantity..",-0.171,103
