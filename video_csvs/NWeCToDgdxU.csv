"12.40 --- true, Luke is older and might not be the best with lightsabers anymore, but Han Solo was 70 in the last movie and he was shooting/punching his way to victory! And Luke can't use a lightsaber? 

I really feel Luke was underused. He barely expressed emotion for his sister being in danger, he didn't care much for Han being dead (which was technically Luke's fault) and worst of all --- he had nothing to say about Kylo praying to Darth Vader's skull??? This was so wasted, in my opinion. 

I truly hope that Luke didn't die at the end. That he just teleported somewhere else, turning up in agony, sweating and vomiting as he just survived some crazy force-projection thing. For me, this film ain't bad but god damn, I walked out of the cinema confused - force awakens got my hopes up too high maybe.",-0.9537,174

I had thought Jedi Island connected them, but neither of them were on that planet at the end.

"59:15 That entire tableau was orchestrated by Luke specifically to get under Kylo's skin (thus buying time for the Reisistance to escape). Kylo has already established that he considers that saber to be *his* in TFA, and it would totally make sense for Luke to add extra levels to messing with the edge-lord's head by using his dad's weapon. The reality of the fact that it just broke is irrelevant to that.",-0.6124,80

"Also, about the Leia in space thing. People have this idea from movies, that you instantly freeze and die when you enter space, but that isn't acurate. Since there is no medium for heat to travel in, you only lose heat at the rate you normally would expel it from your body. You'd die from suffocation long before anything else. It would take several minutes without air for there to be brain damage. And is it really that much of a stretch that a force user could shield their body or slow it down in a way? We have no idea how long she was out there. Most people can easily hold their breath for a couple of minutes without practice and something like 5-6 minutes with just a bit of practice.",-0.9599,144

"Finally went and seen this yesterday. Still digesting it. I liked more of it than I had problems with though. I liked Luke's arc a lot, especially when it came full circle at the end (great sendoff). I do agree with John about the whole pulling out and activating the lightsaber over his sleeping nephew thing, but no film is without sin. The Finn and Rose stuff was weak and felt ""forced"" at points, but I see what they were trying to do with the whole giving a new generation hope angle, especially because Rose and her sister were inspired by Finn's actions in TFA and then they pass that hope onto the children on Canto Bite. All in all a solid SW film in my books. Doesn't feel like the first two (ep. 3 & 4), but the films took a different trajectory in Return of the Jedi and onwards.

"Honestly? I thought Finn's arc was the least offensive thing in the movie. The Luke stuff bugged me more because Luke thought about killing a young Ben Solo. He took on Darth Vader and the Emporer with no back up to save him. He took on a dragon, and did it with redeeming his father. Instead of trying to talk to Ben and saying something like ""I know you have these feelings, but you're wrong and let me explain our family's history"".. he just grabs his lightsaber and at this point Ben Solo is a mere whelp. And AGAIN. In the end of the movie, Luke never ONCE says ""There's no reason to fight. It's all over. Look at what you accomplished."" Instead he gets cocky and puts on a show to let the resistance escape.

 And then the whole story with Poe makes me angry. Poe ignores Leia and of course gets people blown up. Yeah. Because that never happened before. Nobody in the New Relublic ignored Leia and got blown up or anything... And then he ignores his superior and nearly gets the resistance annihilated with his little mutiny. 

Rey being nobody also aggrivated me. Why waste our time with the mystery of who Rey is with 7 and the first half of 8 if your going to avoid the pins and are going for a gutter ball? This story would have been a lot better if 7 started off with Rey remembering being sold for alcohol, because then you would have that build up of her wanting to become a bigger person than her parents. Here it was just thrown in with no regard of advancing the plot. The whole exchange between Kylo and Rey could have been simply cut down to Kylo saying ""You suck, Rey!"" And it would have no less effect on the story. Also the only 4 characters that died were barely in Episode 7, so not much has changed going from 8 to 9. Rey just got some training and Luke is a douchebag force ghost. 

At the end of the day... Episode 8 isn't as bad as the prequels.... but it is way more disappointing than the prequels.",-0.9921,408

"I believe John said something very key in this video. He left his pre-conceptions at the door. So did I and, while also having some trouble with some of it, I ultimately love this film. I have been confused and conflicted ever since but I remember how good I felt about how it left things set for the future of the story. The more I have thought about it and the more I have heard other's, like John, talk about it the more comfortable with how this was handled. I get the impression that most of the people that hate this film had a lot of assumptions and expectations held tightly like a safety blanket and when they didn't get any of what they had speculated about or what they had been hoping for, they just felt betrayed.

The morale I took away from this film was to learn from failure and to accept that your failures are there for you to learn from. They are lessons and we learn a lot more from them than we do from our successes. We should all learn from our mistake of assuming so many things and feeling as though we are owed a story of our choosing. Hopefully we will all keep our speculations and anticipations in check after this. We should still have a lot of fun talking Star Wars and nothing wrong with speculation, but we need to recognize when we go to far and begin to write our own movie rather than watching theirs. This is largely why the casual fans love these films and the serious fans hate them.",0.9483,289

"I find it hard to believe that Poe and Rey hadn't met. They both spent some time at the end of TFA standing next to each other on base when Rey and injured Finn first arrived and while they pieced the map together, they were both concerned for Finn, Poe was standing next to C3PO and Leia when every one was waving goodbye to Rey flying off in the Falcon. Why wouldn't Poe talk to Rey while they were on the base together? I'm sure he would have wanted some answers.",-0.2023,97
I hate this film,-0.5719,4
"I hated that Luke was the way he was Not because he Was the way he was, but because what he did was something uncharacteristic of Luke. Taking his lightsaber, lighting it up and even considering for one split second that he should KILL HIS OWN NEPHEW. Regardless of the shame he felt afterwards, regardless of the years that had transpired, this is the same guy who looked at DEATH IN THE EYE, literally Darth Vader, and instead saw his Father, the Light.
That is utter bullshit. You can convince me that he became a grumpy miserable old man who went to an isolated planet to die because he failed to train his nephew and the young jedi, but you cannot tell me that as a Jedi master, teacher and uncle he actually did three actions after thinking he should kill his nephew: grab the lightsaber, lift the lightsaber, and turn it on.

And another thing, Canto Bight wasn't the ONLY problem. Canto Bight sucked because it also put the Rest of the film at a standstill, and that's because they had the brilliant idea of making it a slow-speed chase film, which resulted in Canto Bight, and which resulted also in a muttany that wouldn't have happened if Holdo was a straight up bitch. Even when Poe is trying to reason she's just like ""No. I'm the leader."" Bitch, he's just trying to get some answers, he KNOWS the mistake he made was stupid, fucking don't leave him in the dark. And we're suppose to feel for her sacrifice? Do you know who would've made a more honourable sacrifice? General Ackbar, or IDK Princess Leia!? or Any other character that the fans already know, even Poe I don't care.

Holdo was bad writing, Rose was bad writing, Canto Bight was bad writing, Maz was bad writing, the entire muttany was bad writing, and Luke was badly executed.",-0.9984,362
"I hated the story, character, and action beats on CANTOBYTE, but I LOVED CANTOBRYTE itself. It looked to me like it came out of Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby. However, I hated the animal cruelty thing and how they had to ""find the master codebreaker."" Why not have Finn and Rose go to Cantobyte find the master codebreaker NAMED Dinson Janilsano who is played by Benicio Del Toro. They are sent a picture message of some sort by Poe OF Dinson Janilsano. No RED PLUME stupidity. Have him be a buddy of Poe's NOT Maz's. Then they can go get him (including a brief introductory make-out moment with a space hooker in honor of Campea). Then we get an optional Lando cameo, having him be Dinson's adopted dad. He is a major war profiteer. Once he got word about Han's death, he stopped caring and started drinking.  Rose hates him, Finn thinks he's cool. Finn actually considers staying on the island, but Rose gets one big scene where she talks about some incredibly valid arguments for fighting the First Order, unlike the idiotic arguments from before (""isn't it disgraceful to RUN? I'm gonna stun you for walking away."" REALLY? YOU ARE A JANITOR. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. NO ONE THERE LIKES YOU. This stuff needs fixing.) Rose hates the planet because she was a slave there with her sister, everyone else likes it. The little boy from the end also is introduced in 25 seconds or less. She is very naive still. Then, we hear about the stormtroopers in search of Resistance members on the island. The four (or three) people are discovered while they make their deal. Lando flees but DJ reluctantly stays true to Finn and Rose because he's sick of living on Lando's money and wants to help in a way that means something. They leave the island, the stormtroopers have caught up and chase them out. F&R get separated from DJ and are forced to flee on those horse-things. Then DJ comes to them with a ship, like in the film. Then they go to break the code, they do it successfully, but unfortunately, DJ gets split up, recognized as a spy, tortured for info, and he makes a deal that tells them where Finn and Rey are and THE VERY LITTLE THAT HE KNOWS about what the Rebels are doing. Then Finn and Rose have to fight their way out, and Rose makes the ultimate sacrifice (she goes on a suicide mission of some sort involving a fight with Phasma during the battle so Finn can leave). This shows Finn the way to being a true war hero, and he meets up with the Rebels alone. However, after this, during the final battle, Finn actually goes into that ship (Rose isn't there to knock him outta the way) and he either sacrifices himself or he makes it out hurt but alive. Doesn't matter, because he really destroys that thing that's firing on the Rebels, but if he lives more walkers come and Poe congratulates him but convinces him to leave, saying that he promises it can be handled, but only by a pilot as experienced as him, and Finn reluctantly agrees, getting the heck outta dodge before it's too late. However, as Poe is getting to the ship, Luke comes and Poe decides to not be the one distracting the First Order because ""some people think you can't always solve stuff by jumping into an X-wing and blowing stuff up. This time, I think they might be right."" However, I can't remember if he went out AFTER Luke in the movie, so I'd keep whatever the movie did. Also, as for the alien inserting coins in BB8: NOTHING CHANGES WITH THAT DUDE. HE'S PERFECT. HE IS MY FAVORITE CREATURE IN THE MOVIE!",-0.9936,730

The worst thing in the movie was the light speed ramming at the end.  It looked cool but made NO sense.  It invalidates every space battle ever in Star Wars.  It makes no sense that they waited for their entire fleet to be destroyed and until they were out of fuel to do it rather than just doing it right off the bat.  Why didn't the First Order jump ahead and intercept them?  Why didn't the First Order ram their ship?  If ramming is an option, EVERY battle should just do that, lol.",-0.9749,151

In regards to Leia surviving in space, here's my view on that: As it is set in a galaxy far, far away, the movies have established that sound can be heard and fire can exist in that galaxy's space. Thus, the galaxy the Star Wars universe exists in does have SOME level of oxygen (albeit a low quantity) for both sounds and fire to exist.

The one-liners happening on Snoke's ship aren't fitting to the story in my opinion. In general there's too much ""happy hour"" in the fights during the last half hour of the film. Rey shouting: ""I like this"" as she shoots Tie fighters down, BB-8 steering an AT-ST, Finn saying something ridiculous before hitting Phasma, Rose shouting: ""Need a lift"" in a happy manner...

It‚Äôs only one scene that‚Äôs pretty shit and the rest of the movie, before and after, is pretty great.  LOVED Luke in this one.   First time saw it, yes it was tough.  I didn‚Äôt understand as most young rebellious types won‚Äôt.  But it‚Äôs a lesson that needs to be learned.  It‚Äôs not all about flashy lightsaber waving.  It‚Äôs so much more.   This movie expands and yet brings a laser-tight focus on the force.  Kylo is amazing.  My favorite character of the new trilogy.  He is so evil, and and fully realizes his potential in this one.  (I know it sounds odd saying he‚Äôs amazing, but he‚Äôs my favorite character, so well done).  Yoda scene was f*ckin bonkers, in a good way.   Rey being nobody is probably the best way they could‚Äôve handled the character.  Luke was nobody, at the beginning. But it‚Äôs not about how they started, it‚Äôs how they end up.

"Not quite sure I agree with you that we didn't need any further exploration regarding the rise of the First Order and the Resistance. Just think: Episode VI is called Return of the Jedi and only two movies later, we're down to The Last Jedi. However, I would argue this is less a problem with Episode VIII than it is with Episode VII, The Force Awakens.

The original trilogy didn't have to show us the origins of the Rebellion and the Empire because it was our first exposure to the Star Wars universe. We entered this world at a time of war. If our heroes are then shown restoring peace to the galaxy in Episode VI, I think it would have worked better story-wise to see how they lose it in Episode VII, especially when the new threat SO closely resembles the one from before. Instead, we've just been fed a whole lot of exposition about Ben Solo's turn to the dark side, and are forced to rely on our own assumptions regarding father-son relationships or teacher-student connections to fill in the gaps. Narratively speaking, it doesn't seem right that the first (and only) scenes onscreen between Kylo Ren and Han and Luke is when the former kills (or tries to kill) the latter two (except for those brief silent flashbacks in The Last Jedi, which aren't really meant to establish a relationship). The same can be said for the new Republic in The Force Awakens: the first time we see the Hosnian system, it's getting blown up! And when it comes to Snoke, I think what ultimately frustrates fans is the idea that the guy is clearly old enough to have been around during the original trilogy, yet we know virtually nothing about how he came to power by Episode VII. His character only seems to be there in the first place because of some perceived need on the writers' part to have an old, decrepit, yet powerful villain pulling the strings.

I think these problems boil down to the filmmakers struggling to make both a reboot and a sequel at the same time, which I can honestly understand. Lucasfilm wanted to wash out the bad memories of the prequels, which, on the surface, meant returning to the things people remembered about loving Star Wars: Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, X-wings, ""rebel scum."" However, I think these images are pretty trivial compared to the heart and spirit of the franchise, its stories, and its characters. Personally, I would have preferred if Episode VII had begun at a time of relative peace, still thirty years later, with Ben Solo nearing the end of his Jedi training with Luke. That's when you introduce Snoke and show us Ben turning to the dark side, instead of drawing the process out over three movies like the prequels had to do with Anakin. The movie could have even ended on the cliffhanger of our legendary hero Luke running away and letting the First Order rise instead of facing the repercussions of his actions. In fact, the Force Awakens would have been a solid Episode VIII! It's like there's a whole movie missing.

The Last Jedi tries to tell us that the Force is larger than one bloodline, that Rey can be as powerful as she is and still come from nothing, that this story is larger than the Skywalkers. The same sentiment can actually be found in the massive Jedi Order on display in the prequels, although Lucas buried it in talk of prophecies and mitichlorians (not to mention terrible writing, terrible acting, and green-screen overload). Nevertheless, despite Rian Johnson's best efforts, this new trilogy is already so indebted to the originals that I think people came to expect a traditional Skywalker story as well...and perhaps rightfully so.",-0.8067,706

"So? It's the result that matters and the originals were good! We have 3 movies of backstory about luke and that backstory is bassically he stood up to the 2nd baddest villain in maybe movie history by sacrificing himself, he was the only guy that ever saw good in Vader. Remember even Yoda and Obi Wan said to him he is lost, and he didn't give up. Almost making the ultimate sacrifice, his life. He could only defeat Vader, by tapping into the dark side. At that point in the movie you see how disgusted Luke is with himself and he throws away his lightsaber. To state that this guys would kill the son of his best friend and twin sister, just because of the kid might turn dark someday is total nonsense and bad writing.Maybe give Han and Leia a call and talk about it. Talk to Yoda, since he's popping up and lighting everything. Luke wasn't surprised about Yoda showing up, so what was Yoda's advice. It is also said by Leia in the first film that Snoke turned him, we saw nothing of that. All we know is that it's all Luke's fault!

I went to the cinema for the Jedi Night and that means you watch both films. And they just don't connect, you leave one film with alot of questions and they are just not answered or answered in 1 or 2 sentences. It shows that it's made by 2 different directors and that the story isn't matched on eachother. Where did Finn learn to fly? How did Rose fall in love with a dude she only just met. How is fuel and engines of any importance in space. Weaponizing hyperspace. Gravity doesn't count no more. Doesn't a dreadnought have some shields? How did Kylo not spot Luke had the blue lightsaber, while he's aching for it all the time. Why is Kylo freaking out about a girl the whole time, did he see in a dream a girl would be superpowerfull? Throwing out akbar, to replace him with the useless Holdo. Plot points enough for you? Alot more where that came from...

 The old characters were only signed into the trilogy to draw in the old fans. But those are the ones that are pissed imo. At least most of them i believe. So why bother. If you really want to go out with the old, give them a purpose and a decent arc and goodbye of the franchise. Solo got a decent end, Luke died like a douchebag and Leia is still around, but the actress died. R2, C3po and Chewwie are timeless characters and they are also shut out of this franchise. The fact Jedi need to train and master the force is chucked out. This was one of the reasons one becomes a jedi, to learn how to use the force for good. Anakin and Luke had to go through so much training to do those things Rey magically can do by herself. Evil users are the raw power users, they hardly train. They get better from doing alot of bad shit. That is the difference between the light and the dark. It's a difference about learning and mastering versus using and abusing the force for personal gain. That is how it was in 6 movies, but not this one... Since when is destroying the lore an act of moving forward?

I like to look at it as if it was a different franchise. Luke is our Gandalf. Imagine they would fuckup the character of Gandalf like this. Suddenly Gandalf doesn't wanna help and do magic no more? For LOTR to move forward, Gandalf should try to kill Bilbo or a Frodo-like character, because he might turn someday or might use the ring for evil. As you can see, it doesn't make any sense and it would hurt that franchise to death. Because Gandalf is the symbol of Good in that franchise. As Luke is and always will be the symbol of Hope! 

Also if it all makes sense, why did the actor of Luke, Mark Hammil, state so many times he doesn't agree with the director? He played the character, discussed with GL on the ins & outs of his character. Have you seen his interviews about that subject? I think that if you do watch those interviews, you see Mark knew this was coming. Because he know how his character works, who his character is and especially how and why the fans adore him.",-0.9887,838
"Some observations: I like how Leia and Holdo's conversation at the end essentially reveals that Leia has been grooming Poe to be the new leader of the Resistance. This is confirmed when Leia says ""What are you looking at me for? Follow him!"" at the end. Really lovely passing of the torch there and very moving when you realize this is Carrie Fisher's final performance as Leia.

Finn has a nice arc which starts with VII and crystallizes over the course of VIII. VII depicts him as being a man afraid of the First Order and only interested in running away. He tags along with Han to rescue Rey but, as he reveals to Han, he doesn't know how to lower the shield at the Star Killer Base; he's just there to rescue Rey and everyone else can fuck off. This is still the case at the beginning of VIII, but over the course of the movie he becomes committed to the Resistance. It occurred to me that this change happens because he sees DJ as the person he could potentially become if he keeps running and he's disgusted by that notion. So now it'll be interesting to see Finn fully embrace the Resistance in IX.

A lot of people were bummed out by Snoke getting killed, and I even thought ""But IS he dead????"" After thinking about it for a while and re-watching the movie, I realized that Snoke better be dead because this is not his story and that's the point. We've seen bad guys like Snoke before, Emperor types who are EVIL! and want nothing else than to shift the balance towards the Dark Side. But Snoke isn't the villain. Kylo is the villain and he's done with business as usual. Appropriately enough, he killed Han in VII and then Snoke in IX, the Light Side and the Dark Side respectively. So now he's a new kind of villain and a more interesting one, a more nuanced villain who isn't necessarily trying to squash the Light Side or embrace the Dark Side, instead he wants to tear the whole thing down. This is kind of fascinating to me because it means that Kylo is no longer playing by the old rules, he'll be making up his own rules in IX, finding his own balance and it might not be what we're expecting. There's a lot of potential there.

Lastly, watching the movie again, it struck me how well VII and VIII work together despite the criticism that VIII contradicts VII. In fact, VII telegraphs the developments in VIII. Maz flat out tells Ray that her parents aren't coming back in VII. In retrospect, they were very directly telling us that the identity of her parents isn't what's important. Likewise, it's established that Luke is a broken man. He's become a hermit who ran away after he failed his student. All of this is revealed in VII. VIII doesn't contradict this, it only develops the story further. Make no mistake, JJ and Johnson are absolutely on the same page here. There's a lot more consistency and purpose here than people are giving the movie credit for.

I also noticed more subtle little callbacks to VII, like Rey admiring BB-8's new antenna (she fixed his old one when it got bent in Force Awakens) or how Rey's Force vision in Force Awakens is revisited via Luke's flashback - as he watches the temple burn, the way he puts his hand on R2D2 was part of Rey's vision.

As I've said else where, I think this movie is going to grow on people. It's a very philosophical movie. The big changes aren't external, they're internal. And the way the movie subverts expectations is jarring. I actually love how people ""hate"" this movie in a weird way. Not in a ""haha you guys are dumb, it's awesome!"" kind of way but I appreciate how the movie is rattling a lot of fans who have come to expect certain things from a Star Wars movie and feel cheated by Last Jedi. That's actually the movie's biggest strength to me. Luke says it best: ""This isn't going to go the way you think."" And yes, that can feel ""wrong"" but that's what I find refreshing and exciting about this movie and what it means for IX.",0.9897,813

"The Holdo stuff was the worst part to me. Every time she was on screen I just found myself getting angry because she was just so bad. She's supposed to be leading these people but she doesn't think she needs to tell them anything? If Poe is a good standard to go by then most of them have never served under her, so they don't have the kind of faith in her needed for them to just give her their blind trust. I mean, who does she think she is? Jesus? Because he's the only other person I can think of that requires complete and utter faith from his followers without giving any visible rewards for said faith.  Then she's just kind of a bitch to Poe, who obviously has the respect of a large amount of the crew, so she's not exactly getting on their good side that way. And even though Poe was demoted it's not like they just made him the damn janitor or something, he's still a ranked officer (I don't know if you're actually considered an officer with the rank of captain, but you get what I mean). All Poe wanted to know was the fucking plan and since she didn't give it to him he assumed, and when most people assume, they assume the worst. I get that she doesn't have a whole lot of reason to trust them, but neither do they have reason to trust her and she's expecting them to put a whole shit load of trust in her, does anyone else see the problem with that?",0.7928,289

"The problem with the mistakes of the characters is not that they made mistakes, it's that the mistakes were completely fucking stupid.

It all comes down to the stupidity of Vice Admiral Holdo. She went out of her way to dick around with Poe, deliberately pissing him off for no reason, which ultimately lead to Poe sending Finn and Rose off in the first place. Holdo had no reason to hold back the plan from anyone, especially one of the top commanders of the Rebellion, but did so anyway. For some reason telling everyone that they're just running away in to space and doomed to die was a better idea than telling them there was a pretty solid plan for survival. 
These weren't bad character judgements, or even mistakes. It was shit writing for a terrible payoff that was supposed to teach Poe a lesson. What that lesson was exactly, other than teaching us that Holdo and Leia are terribly incompetent leaders, though, is beyond me. 
Holdo deserved to die at the end of the movie, because every resistance fighter's death during that escape is 100% her fault. Yes, Poe made mistakes, but he was acting on the information he was given, and working under the extremely well founded belief that Holdo was a fucking idiot who had no idea what she was doing. And of course Finn and Rose made mistakes. Finn is not a smart character. He just isn't. He hasn't done a single noteworthy thing in either TFA or TLJ, so of course he and his engineer-turned-soldier girlfriend are going to fuck up. It all falls back on Holdo.

Holdo was a terrible character. She existed only as a plot device, but the one positive thing about her is now she's dead and won't be around to fuck up any more Star Wars movies. I haven't been more satisfied watching a character die since Joffry from GoT.",-0.9982,354

"it would've been so emotional if a couple of the jedi appeared as force ghosts including obi wan, anakin, yoda, mace windu, etc. Luke starts crying and theres like blood on his face from a  previous fight and its playing that emotional john williams theme in the background. The force is unbalanced since there are only a few dozen rebels so the force ghosts give luke this insane amount of power. He then becomes like a class 5 mutant and is tearing apart the at-at's and star destroyer with his mind. After thats over, he returns to normal and kylo charges screaming at luke. Luke turns his head to look at the remaining rebel forces and smiles. Kylo ren slashes at luke and he disappears just like obi wan kenobi leaving only his robe falling to the ground. Kylo retreats in some scout ship and then later there is a funeral with the 2 suns in the backdrop. The ending would be the rebels celebrating and whatnot at night and we see fin and rey sitting on something idk, and she's crying after all she's seen and been through but then you hear someone whisper rey. Both fin and rey look up and they see the dead jedi luke saw before he dies and right in the middle of the jedi luke is standing there smiling, he holds out his hands and gives rey his green lightsaber the one he used to defeat vader. Then the jedi just walk off 1 by 1 and disappear.",-0.9312,273
