"Wolverine 7777:

What you write relates to another problem: http://countrymeters.info, and it does not apply to artificial intelligence, I personally, perceive it as a natural process. Including social decisions of the government.

Easter Island, May Tribal, Crusades ... First, Second World War. Refers to natural social manifestations. Because of unmanageable reproduction of people. Load on the ecosystem, defecita of well-being ... And here artificial intelligence does not.

We just make a decision for the best of our mind. All humanity is built, simply on the understanding of what it means to be a good farmer. And consciously take a heavy but mitigating decision, and most importantly in advance ...

Yes, what you wrote, this is already today, but you have greatly exaggerated. This takes the form of a call for abstinence, reproduction, on the same level as eating meat, since there is still a problem of the livestock of 3 billion ... By the way, CO2 production exceeds all cars of the world. And it is quite natural and fair that people who voluntarily and prudently sacrifice many to live in a better society do not want to see in them those who did not sacrifice what they donate, but wants to have all the best that they received in return! I focus your attention here!

You implement this in a compulsory manner. But this can not even be ... Since if you look at history and apply to mathematics, you will find some point of optimality of this call, it has the strength of no more than a call-up, otherwise an attempt to impose will lead to unification of forces and blaming faults for all those who call. And with all the lies of the embittered masses, in addition to make a scapegoat in all perverted form ... I would call it a cunning counterattack. Therefore, usually because of this behavior, the real world government often lets everything go by its own way. Syria, Libya, Ukraine ... Many are strange to Africa. I know the story of how they really tried to help Zimbabwe. A starving country, where the most fertile land ... And they want a better life, to this day in the Berenga channel, they shoot from the machine gun, those who are trying to cross over to a better life ... And to stop this, repeatedly tried to lead to civilization. They brought grain, cows showed how they are engaged in farming ... They ate the same on the first day. And they said to bring more ... They tried to accustom them to work ... But, it caused a wave of protest and they made a revolution declared independence ... And now they live with this ""independence"" ... There are many such stories ...

The whole land is full of different stages of the development of social groups. Where the primary cause is the clear, the prevailing choice of the societies themselves ...

-----------------------

At the expense of artificial intelligence.
In this problem, with all the desire above all man - to soak it in this problem! For AI, it's just the territorial disputes of beetles under the leaves ...

With all our concern, he will look at her with rather cold impartial vzlyadom, and such a neural network Alfa Zero in chess, just find the best solution ... Well, and how globally ...

I see his appearance as a singularity without analogues, even much more than the ""Cambridge explosion"", where before there was a very small variety of creatures, the same primitive life, and after: the invention of the spine, the sudden appearance of a huge variety, over a relatively short period of time . For many millions of years, there is much more waiting for us. These are new forms of life! Colonization of planets, such as titanium, not by people, but by life, not on water but on methane basis! Synthesis of life forms optimally fit under the environment! To do this, one must learn a lot on the basis of this life, this is an exclusively research interest! At the very least, I, as a programmer, would have refined this ... And not as Ilon Mask, suggests to make a robot a servant, someone's desires. Of course, then there can be North Korea around the world. But if it happens (which is unlikely), then for a fairly short period of time. Already more adequate minds, realizing the AI ‚Äã‚Äãabout which I write ... The near future, in the same way will become very diverse! In which, as today, no one will want to return to the spears)

I would like to make a reprimand.

"Wolverine 7777:

Yes I agree. I'm sure that competing companies will create a fairly free AI. The absence of monopoly minimizes risks. With all the desires of Google to buy the entire theme (including this BostonDynamics). IBM (Watson) and Tesla (OpenAI), to insure us against the AI. The US policy is good enough in the fight against the monopoly, I am sure that everything will be in a much better light, without this dangerous gap.

In occasion of crowding out people. Yes, Here risks are exposed, highly skilled and highly paid specialists (including my profession). The rest is simply not profitable to replace.",0.9445,126

forever SHAMPOO you pre-program movements in combination with AI that can evolve and learn from previous imputation which allows these robots to do what you see. You see how it can do a back flip now? Well with the information it attained from learning to do the flip it can use that information and apply it at later times to achieve a goal. It's similar to that other video they have uploaded of the robot slipping on the banana. It will learn from the error and use it at a later time for its own benefit. Think of it like this. I have an alphabet and I give you all the letters but you don't know how to spell and you don't know what words are. If I teach you words it's great and all but you still won't know how to make sentences as you don't know the context of words in combination with other words. You may get lucky and make a sentence that makes sense but not likely on the first try. That lucky part is where we exploit information since most learning algorithm are trial and error. Once in a while the program is right and makes a sentence that makes sense. It stores that information if it gets the right outcome. So that robot you seen fell on its face a thousand times before it did a back flip.,0.9267,247
