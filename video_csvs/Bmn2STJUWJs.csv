Jesus loves us, friends. He is not angry at us, and neither does He hate us. He came down from heaven to die on our behalf, and rose again the 3rd day. He got the Victory over the grave! Hallelujah!

Death can't hold Him down, and neither will it hold you down if you call upon Jesus today. Make Him Lord of your life and you will be saved!
