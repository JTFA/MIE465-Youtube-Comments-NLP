If you think about it, these women were molested at a young age. Imagine a man 20 years older than you touching your private areas when you‚Äôre in your teens or even younger without warning. He just starts to touch you and say ‚ÄúOh it is just a medical procedure ‚Äù knowing full and will that it wasn‚Äôt. It horrifying and traumatizing. 

When someone is sexually abused at a young age, they have no clue what to do. They have no clue on what to think or how to react because they have never experienced it before. Most of the time, they don‚Äôt try to talk about it because the memories makes them depressed and suicidal. They feel like they are alone. They feel used and unwanted. They put the blame on themselves even though they did nothing wrong because that is what society is telling them to do.  But once one woman came out and told her story, that is when the others had the courage to tell their story because they knew they were not alone.

"I don't like this judge. I feel like she added her personal opinion and used words that showed her opinion. She acted unprofessionally. I felt like she used the fact that everyone hated Nassar to her advantage and went overboard for the media. She could've stayed neutral without all the extra stuff she said ""I just signed your death warrant"" and still do her job. But she won't get in trouble because everyone hates Nassar and will congratulate her for ""roasting"" him. 

In a completely unrelated topic I think this shows how broken our justice system is. The 175 year sentence doesn't do anything except to act as a symbolic ruling to show ""its 2018, we care about women now"" or something. He's gonna be far dead before he can even finish a quarter of that sentence. I think given his age (54) he should've been sentenced 10-20 years total (including all of this and his child porn charges). By the time he gets released, in say 20 years, he'll be 74 years old. I doubt he'll do what he did again at 74. And if he did after giving him this chance, the judge can put him back into prison. I believe that everyone should live their last couple of years in peace and without confinement. The prison system shouldn't be used as punishment, it should be used as rehabilitation when the person finishes their sentence. You want them to be a better person when they come out than when they went in. If you really wanted to lock a person up for 175 years then why would you waste the time and tax money on the person? There's no point rehabilitating someone who will die anyways. Furthermore, our prison system is so bad and people are treated so horribly that I believe Nassar will get killed by another inmate because of what he's done. Look up the Norway prison system and how they do things. Much more effective than the [insert triple digit] years sentence they do in the usa. 

All these people wanting 'revenge' and saying this sentence is justified, note that these things never work. Look at what happened with WW1. The sanctions imposed on Germany made them mad and that caused WW2. If Germany wasn't sanctioned so harshly, WW2 might've never happened. Same thing with prisoners. The more you dehumanize, neglect, punish and treat them without respect, they'll rebel. This is why the US prison system is a failure. The system is designed to punish people and keep them in, not rehabilitate them and get them out.

Finally, look at the comments. This is the problem with the US prison system. Everyone wants 'justice' by locking the guy up for X years or life. Revenge is not justice. Wake up people. Putting someone in jail is not the solution. Everyone is human. Jail is for rehabilitation not for punishment. And you wonder why the crime rate is so high in the US. People who get locked up will go on to do more crimes because they don't give a shit. They have no future and they think prison is the worst thing that's gonna happen.",-0.9977,599

"This incompetent haggish ""judge"" should be removed from the bench immediately, disbarred and prohibited from ever holding any position of trust in the future.  What a disgrace of a person.  Unprofessional and incompetent in every professional way.",-0.8555,43
"This judge Rose Mary Aquilina is a shameful example of 'justice'. Yes Larry Nassar should be given some punishment for what he did, but everything about this judge, and about the media coverage is wrong. The undisguised glee in her voice at the thought of him and what he will suffer in prison, and the same from the female journalist host, speaks volumes about them as human beings. What kind of person would wish constant rape, torture, fear and pain on another? They probably see themselves as Christians, I suppose. 
Another huge issue is the victim impact statements. Victim impact statements DO NOT belong in a court of law. They are designed only to introduce emotion to a process that is supposed to be devoid of emotion and based on the facts. Do we really need to hear from a rape victim, to know that rape is painful and traumatizing? Does a real judge not already know this? That is what the sentences are designed around. Sentences for crimes are designed based on the harm that the crime causes to victims and the community. It's already taken into account. 
Furthermore, why did we hear from so many of the victims, since a plea deal was made on only a handful of cases? If the man has pled guilty to only a handful of the crimes, then only those victims should even be considered in court. All the others are not relevant and remain allegations until proven in a court of law, so it was incredibly unprofessional to do so. 
The 60 year sentence for possessing images is also completely insane. They are images, people. He did not make them, photograph them, or arrange for them to be created. He LOOKED at them. That should not even be a prison sentence. Prison should be reserved for people who have hurt others and are a present threat to continue doing so, not for some mentally aberrant person who looks at mere pictures. This is only in America, the country where they send everyone to jail forever for everything, and no one seems to ever question it. 
Lastly, what everyone seems to be missing here is that this guy is very sick. Everyone keeps saying it, but seem unaware of the meaning and consequence of it. The journalists keep saying how sick he is, how unaware of what he did is wrong, how he 'just doesn't get it.', and yet they seem incapable of drawing the conclusion from this. The guy is sick. He is like a broken machine that either does not know what is wrong or is incapable of overcoming his urges. If he 'just doesn't get it', then why do you expect him to 'get it' at the same time? If he had 'gotten it' in the first place he would never have done any of this. Yes he should be given some punishment, and yes he should be kept away from people for a while, and young girls for a long time, but all the hatred just shows how vile and empty and vicious society itself is, how utterly incapable of empathy. This guy is like a dumb dog that just doesn't know it's not supposed to shit on the carpet, and all these great moral authorities here are wishing that he get raped. Shame, shame on ‚Äúmoral authorities‚Äù. Time to do soul searching. If you are actively hoping for untold pain and misery on another human being, then you seriously need to re-evaluate yourself and your own morality.",-0.9995,669

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

"sushilover9 I get what you're saying and I am also disgusted with Nassar but the problem is that it's not her job to show bias even if warranted. The best example I can think of is if your babysitter left your children home alone because she had to go save a dog in a hot car across town. She did an admirable thing but neglected her duty to your children. If nothing else, she opens up Nassar's legal team to claim a mistrial due to the judge's overt bias. If that happens, she didn't do these women any favors.",0.7351,107

"—ç—Ç–æ –º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º—É–º Yes, I do know a LOT of guys who think sexual assault is COMPLETELY fine. It is seriously alarming. About 3/4 of the guys I know think it's not a big deal bc the person assaulted gets *enjoyment* out of it too, when that is, of course, not the case. This trial will remind people who take the issue too lightly that it's not all fun and games. There is damage done to the victims, and he needed to face the consequences and be made an example of so that others can re-evaluate their opinion of sexual assault, and people's understanding of it will change (hopefully leading to less assault, and less shame put on the victims)",-0.9701,134
