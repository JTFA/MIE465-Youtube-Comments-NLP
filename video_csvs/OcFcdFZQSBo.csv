Hooper's Delight I can tell you're white? (Try black) What you fail to understand is just because his dad didn't bother didn't mean the brother didn't want nothing to do with him.Can a 5 year old pick up the phone and guess his phone number or get in a car and drive? I'm not saying ur missing any marbles but there's a hole in the bag somewhere. I was right on the mark when I called you a ball sucker you would lick the cheese off lebrons nuts you house nigga. I'm sick of all these light skin niggas acting like they ALL black. Go fetch for masta you ain't no field nigga lol,-0.7164,121
Hooper's Delight lemme ask u a question. Are u in love with lebron? Ur getting really defensive for him. If lebron doesn't want to bother with him thats his choice. It just shows he's fake. He just a put on individual. Do it for the camera kind of guy. Everyone really thinks this guy can do no wrong. I don't hate lebron and we all have faults but there is no doubt lebron is fake. Just like when he left for Miami then left there to go back he's a snake.,-0.7225,101
Hooper's Delight so because he never met his dad that can't be his brother? Lebron knows who his dad is his mom told him. He chooses not to talk about his dad because he wasn't in his life which is also why he didn't take his dads last name. His brother by the same dad just wants a relationship with his brother. Just because you wasn't raised together and don't know one another means nothing. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree but you wouldn't understand that because your a cuck. You suck balls daily. And if I seen your misshaped head I would slap you with a funnel cake.,-0.09,119
Hooper's Delight well if you actually looked into it his brother doesn't want money from him. He just wants his brother in his life? Is it the brothers fault his dad didn't raise lebron? Just from your comment showed your true colors. You can suck my balls you selfish lebron James nut riding rang a tang titty cuck.,-0.1235,63
