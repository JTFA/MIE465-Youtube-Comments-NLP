The part about Hanoi Jane was factually unrelated and unnecessary to make your point, but seemed to be included to be sure folks realize Jane Fonda isn't perfect and hasn't the right to lecture anyone about being appropriate. Truth be told, both of you had your feelings hurt. The greater truth was to simply defend the interview question, but to share that you appropriately assumed she was proud of her plastic surgery and invited her to have a real, honest discussion on aging without blame or shame.

"I think Kelly made some fair points and explained her line of thinking well with regards to her plastic surgery question to Fonda, which is why I was in Kelly's corner.....right up until the moment she mentioned Fonda's activism during the Vietnam War. First of all, like I said she had made a good case for having asked about Fonda's plastic surgery, so why go completely off topic? Simply to stick the boot in? Out of spite? To play the person, not the topic? And all the while whilst projecting a sense that she, Kelly, was the one taking the higher ground. That, in my opinion, is disgusting behaviour. Secondly, I believe Fonda has admitted and apologized for attacking the troops, rather than successive administrations, during the Vietnam War. She is a human being and like all of us, she made a mistake. She has owned that mistake. Do we not, even after decades, forgive her for it? Third, if Fonda has said that she is not proud of today's America, I think she is justified in feeling that way. Since Kelly brought up the Vietnam War, just think about the similarities between it and the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent war that continues to this day with regards to Government lies as just one example. It seems the U.S. has learnt nothing, no? Finally, Kelly very subtly suggests right at the end of this video that to question your country, particularly on matters of war, is to be unpatriotic or somehow un-American. This is a very common FOX News, and dare I say it, conservative tactic. The 1st Amendment was put in place by The Founding Fathers, however, for the specific purpose of protecting the right of citizens to speak out against their Government. To enact that right just might be the most patriotic, the most American thing you can do as a citizen.",-0.9542,366

Rather than publicly attack and try to discredit an 80 year old woman with this elder abuse statement maybe she should have been more compassionate and apologized. Why bring up something that Jane Fonda said or did many many years ago; that's what online trolls do. God for bid that someone finds out that Megyn said something racist or that she fat shamed someone when she was 19 years old and publicly throws it in her face. I have been watching Megyn's new show and although I am not a conservative, I enjoy her shows. I was so used to seeing Megyn be vicious in her previous job that it was nice to see her doing something that showed a different side to her. In the future, I recommend that Megyn leave her fangs at her previous job. Also, shame on the show for allowing this. I know ratings are important, but it's more important for Megyn to continue to work on her image and show people that she can step out of her former role of being a vicious person and that she can evolve into a empathetic and understanding talk show host/public persona.

"Way to go Megyn, Jane put herself out there! Americans need to remember and new eras need to know. She had America so riled and upset, she shamed this country and our soldiers, who were fathers, husbands, bros and American men that didn't have a choice but go to war, she made it ok to spit on our men, she dropped from sight for decades and back in Hollywood like nothing happened. Go to Google young people see why they call her Hanoi Jane. Glad meygn was brave enough to call her out on it all.",0.7476,108

"Why did Megyn Kelly wait four months to do a hatchet job editorial piece to camera? I'd really like to know the answer to that. I had to check the date of the Fonda/Redford interview, thinking that even if it were November it was a long time to wait. But no, it was late September. If Kelly and her producers had it in mind to do a follow up editorial in the days after the interview, fine. A little petty, but fine. 

But to ask a guest about cosmetic surgery, be taken aback by the response, sit on that feeling throughout the holiday period and _then_ do a hit piece to camera in late January? The only reasonable explanation is a strange attempt to lift poor ratings.",0.2389,143

"Wow! I loved that! Fonda went on the show with a chip on her shoulder because Megyn Kelly was a foxnews girl. That was obvious. And she wanted to be offended, so she was. Megyn did the right thing and I think this is an excellent post thank you for putting it on your YouTube channel",0.9258,62
