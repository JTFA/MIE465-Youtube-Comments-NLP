I used to hold a cigarette up to my mouth but I never  ever in my life smoked a cigarette  because i thouht it was cool to look like I was smoking, but here's the catch I never ever smoked anything in my life nor do I so if you think you can produce a picture of her with a cigarette does not mean she smokes and here is better evidence her voice would have showed  she was a smoker  according to you if she was a smoker . If she was a smoker she would not be able to sing as long as she has if she was a smoker so knock bit off. Traccie was simply giving the viewer some  personal family fun and you wanna make some  mess out of it  wow",0.9659,158
