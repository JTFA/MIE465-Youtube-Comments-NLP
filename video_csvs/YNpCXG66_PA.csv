"Animals are beautiful & need to be highly respected, as they live in realms of consciousness untouched by humans in their purity. 

The Grizzly Man movie was one of the most horrific documentaries about a ""bear specialist"", who lived with bears for many years and one day, his oldest friend just turned on him.

But that unpredictability is also what makes them so beautiful.

Enjoy them, but be cautious too.",0.7175,80

"Its really a double edged sword because we need places like these to take care of the animals coming out of the pet and circus trade when the previous owners are not able to take care of them, but people see places like this and think they can keep bears as well. And its not just with bears, its with all exotic pets and then nt even exotic pets. People think puppies and kittens are cute and buy them but when they get older they don't want them anymore or can't pay the vet bills. Its the same with zoos. They are there to ""teach"" the public about wildlife but so many people walk out of there believing they can also keep a tiger in their backyard. 
I agree that our we are taking over the wild habitats and that needs to stop. But create sactuaries and let the animals stay wild. Don't train them and in so put fuel on the fire for the illegal trade of animals. They need less human interaction, not more. 
I love animals and would be in paradise if my backyard was a zoo but I have to make the difficult decision everytime I want to get a pet of whether that species would truly benefit of my care. I know that some animals will never be able to return to the wild but it is still a difficult decision.",0.9201,252
Its really amazing to see how people can live in harmony with almost any animal on earth but then we genocide each other,0.5262,23
"Its so annoying when people say ""animals should be in the wild"" as a reason for people to not take care of animals and help a population of exotic animals thrive. Like honey YOU dont need to take care of them but you do realize some animals wouldnt survive in the wild, right? You wouldnt leave your domesticated housecat or dog in the woods to let it survive. They wouldnt survive very long in most cases. Same thing with captive bred exotic animals",-0.2029,90
