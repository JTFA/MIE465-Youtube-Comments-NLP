Hell was not created for us, friends. It was created for the devil, and the devil is trying take as much people with him there. This is why the devil hates Jesus, because Jesus Alone made a Way, that is Himself, back to God! Hallelujah! 

So please friends, make Jesus your Lord and Savior today if you haven't already. Call upon Him in Truth, and you will be saved! Hallelujah!

"You are a total loser Adrian Collins and obviously a stupid fu*king Liberal..... What have you given to others lately???....they gave a turkey out to EVERY household in Lawrenceburg, KY, pop. 10,500.  The homes they filmed were direct current employees,  ex employees, community volunteers and family members...Why must you be a Debbie Doubter?  Maybe this video will prompt other large corporations to do similar things in their communities.",-0.885,86

Look theres bad all over the world, and suffering, but when someone as high profile as him puts his boots on and goes out of his way to do something nice, he should be highlighted and not torn down.
