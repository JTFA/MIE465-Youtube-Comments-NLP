"""Much of the innovation in industrial baking has gone into speeding up what was traditionally, ... been a slow process.
But since time is money, bread dough, even when it is made up of whole-grain wheat, is inoculated with a special kind of commercial fast-acting yeast, in order to hurry-up its rising in humongous ovens.
It then gets one set of conditioners so it can withstand rapid handling by machines and another to speed up (or replace) gluten development. It is then heavily sweetened so that it tastes like white bread.
Yet there are problems with speeding up the manufacture of whole-grain bread.
Most of the new whole grain breads on the market are made with a new variety of hard white wheat. The wheat is milled using a process that attains a degree of fineness never before achieved in a whole-grain flour.
This flour makes for a softer, whiter, whole-bread that winds up being metabolized almost as fast as white flour, obviating one the most important health advantages of whole grains: that its best for bodies to absorb and metabolize them slowly in order to avoid the insulin spikes hat typically accompany the consumption of refined carbohydrates.
The glycemic index of a whole-grain Wonder Bread is around 71 while that of stone-ground flour is 52.
All whole grains contain phytic acid which helps slow the body’s absorption of starch as well as help making the gluten proteins more easily digestible. Speeding up the fermentation process from 1 or 2 days into a mere several hours negates this action.
The rising numbers of people who have shown an intolerance to gluten (which is a compound protein) is arguably the result of modern industrial bread-making."" (from Michael Pollan)",0.9562,318
"""Shelf Life"" and ""Consistency"" are politically correct industry terms.  What they are doing is creating an artificial product that allows for false scarcity and cost controls that would otherwise not be possible, yet remains familiar enough to seem identical.

My bread lasts at MINIMUM 6 days sitting on the counter.  Up to 14 days in a breadbox.  I don't use any chemicals.  You can kill mold spores with a UV hand lamp and a sifter.  It would actually be cheaper for major manufacturers to use the same UV treatment on their flour as water companies use on water.

But, cheaper is not always more profitable.  And for the purpose of price fixing and profit control, they continue to ""modify"" and artificially ""enrich"" their products as a means to maintain permanent scarcity, even during times of great abundance.  

I've seen the harvest fluctuate so wildly in gross weight that the prices started to fall below operating costs, year after year.  And the trend on production is always up.  Even the worst wheat year now is better than the best yields 50+ years ago when compared against production and demand metrics.

But the price of bread, always goes up.

That's reality.  All the nonsense fake news excuses people come up with and perpetuate are just a reflection of an issue larger than they can rationalize as anything more than ""on the other team"".  So they muster a tribally motivated defense to combat it.

The simple facts of the matter are clear.  Wheat is more abundant than ever before in all of history.  Yet the cost of bread is somehow still on an exponential growth curve to support mega corporations which monopolize a false scarcity market.  This is bad news.  The chemicals they put in the bread are just a secondary layer of convolution to solve a problem they created for the express purpose of needing a solution.

If you don't follow my logic, read the book entitled ""Pimp"" by Iceberg Slim.  It explains how you put extra mileage on hoe that's reached her maximum amount of tricks.  The same theory applies to economic systems of exploitation.  Create a fake problem, solve it, and profit of the ignorance of those who bought it.

Turns out the Bread industry is a bunch of Pimps, and the consumers are all tricks.  hashTag: RealTalk",0.3846,438

"11:34 Bread doesnt seem ball shaped enough though. Needs to be ""folded into itself"", like you touch the top, and bring the hand down on all sides so that the top gets stretched at the top, and the flabby dough at the bottom squished together where they will have nowhere to go so they will go inside the ball of dough. Its ok to have creases at the bottom, which will be more of less flat anyway because its moulded by the bottom of the tin. But more importantly, this is supposed to give some better texture. Not solely to share the joys of breadmaking with Andy, but for anyone else interested. Really, playing with dough is very enjoyable.

Sorta like this scene from the Simpsons, except that the extra skin is pushed into the dough rather than leaking out

"Everyone should make bread at home! It's so easy to make a simple sandwich loaf. Kneading, folding, and shaping do take a few tries to perfect but are nothing to worry about. It costs about $0.70 to make a 1000g loaf at home, and costs $2 for a 700g loaf of the cheapest white bread at the store. Quality difference is amazing. Even cheaper if you keep a levain culture since you don't need to buy yeast. 

From a commercial standpoint, the food chemist is correct, but taste- wise the end products are night and day. I do have a few gripes with his information. 

- Consuming preservatives (antifungals) affects gut flora; it is just bad for you if done every day (as he said, the poison is in the dose).
- The bioavailability of artificially added micronutrients is known to be very low, as opposed to when they are present in a whole food, such as wheat. 
- Bread is best one to two days after baking and can be used for up to a week if stored properly. It goes from fresh, to toast, to bread pudding, to croutons/breadscrumb before you toss it. It can also be frozen just fine. 

The best breads are made naturally leavened (like the baker in the video) and contain only flour, water, salt, and levain (yeast). This seems very limiting even considering the variety of flours available, but the technique can be varied widely.

OP, if you want to make better bread, study a little technique! Your gluten was under developed and the loaves was poorly shaped. It's quite simple to do, but takes a little practice to get right. Can be done very well within a few loaves and some light reading. Check out the book ""Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast"" by Ken Forkish.

"Salt is a chemical.  Yeast metabolizing sugars to release CO2 is a chemical process. Anything that is cooked goes through chemical changes.  The chemicals that bother people are all made from natural ingredients that are then mixed, cooked, distilled, and go through processes similar to what is used when cooking, but in huge vats under strict quality control. So .. when does something become a 'bad' chemical?? It seems to be a very arbitrary statement with no basis in science.  Often, it seems based more on ignorance than on facts.

I'm not saying that every chemical is good or bad. But salmonella and botox are a naturally occurring and highly toxic. Some of the worst food poisoning outbreaks in the US were caused by organically grown food mishandled. Natural does not always mean 'good', man-made does not always mean bad. As noted in the video, these chemicals are highly regulated. People who eat normal amounts of a wide variety of foods don't have anything to worry about. Someone who drinks gallons of water a day is just as much at risk of health issues as someone who drinks lots of soda.

Eat what you like, but eat a wide variety.  I love a bologna sandwich on fresh Wonder Bread with Kraft Cheese and yellow mustard.

I also make my own banana bread every few days and croissants once in a while. Because it's not that difficult once I learned how and is much better than anything in the store. I can freeze the croissant dough and only bake a few at a time.  (For some reason, the banana bread lasts for several days, I haven't figured out why.)  I make cornbread and am very careful to eat it within a couple of days because it goes rancid very quickly and there is nothing worse than taking a mouthful of rancid cornbread that is only three days old.

The main issue with why the bread did not rise very much might be because you did not give it a resting period between when you mixed it and when you baked it.

Nor is it just what is added to the food during process but also the chemicals used during the growing of the ingredients, the rat poisons added to rail cars when shipping the wheat or the flour, this also includes trucks, ships, or any other major shipping method.

Some medical radiation is stored as hazardous waste, but when leaving the storage facility it is now considered fertilizer and used in the farm fields.  This goes for other hazardous waste as well.

This is not counting the amount of debris that is allowed in food products which can include animal feces, body parts, or other foreign matter.  And all allowed by the Federal Government as long as it dont exceed a specific amount.

Ask yourself with so much control in the food industry why is there so much food recall due to e-coli, and other food poisonings every year.  Remember the chilies or tomatoes a few years back or the peanut butter that was contaminated, or lettuce, and the list goes on and on and on.
