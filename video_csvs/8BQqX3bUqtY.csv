"Christopher ""GeT_RiGhT"" Alesund (born May 29, 1990) has, since the start of his professional career, been one of the highest rated players in almost all tournaments that he attended.

"I am walking down that road
Where did all the flowers go?
They say we're supposed to grow
Learning from the highs and low
All eyes lying on me, oh
Begging me to play the role
'Cause I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I'm gonna get it right
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
All my dreams are running wild
I'm gonna chase them down
They said, ""you can't lose your mind, hurry up, you're out of time""
I said, ""I will rise and shine, even in the coldest night""
'Cause I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right
You can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I'm gonna get it right
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right",0.8311,229
