I don't think Trump comprehends the fact that he's hated so much.

Well, that's sort of a wierd question because it really depends on your background. If I was on the news for stealing someone's dog when it turned out that the dog just came running to me, of course I'd fight for my defense. However, the intensity of the president's actions are much different. If I were the president, I wouldn't think that personal attacks should matter. My reason: history will be the true decider. No one will remember the guy that was accused of stealing a dog in a century, but the 44 men that have taken the presidency will be remembered for who knows how long. The fact that Trump has to make *himself* look good in front of everybody day after day doesn't make him presidential. It makes him look ridiculously insecure, just like most people.",-0.6808,157

"Letter to Trump
●
The Brazilian Government is an active partner in Drug Trafficking and International Terrorism.
They create laws that protect the criminal rather than condemn them, from the least offender to the corrupt politician.
It is directly linked to Islamic Terrorism, which is financed with money from the Brazilian people, through the BNDS, with terrorist cells in our country, being formed, created and maintained by members of the São Paulo Forum.
Moreover, they are bringing to Brazil, preferably Islamic ""refugees"", to the detriment of Christian refugees, offering houses, food and washed clothes, with the clear objective of transforming Brazil and Latin America into Territory of the Islamic State.
Brazilian Uranium is extracted and enriched in our Territory and will stop in countries contrary to the values ​​of Western society, with full knowledge of the Military High Command of our Armed Forces, which I am sure, unconditionally support the murder of the Christian Western People.
Our People and the rest of Latin America, like the Venezuelans, suffer diotrically from the actions of mass destruction of human lives by the omission of those who can save us.
We ask your attention to this fact, because it interferes in the maintenance of the existence of humanity.
