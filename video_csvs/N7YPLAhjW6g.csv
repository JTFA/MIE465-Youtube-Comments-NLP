I'm interested in buying one or two,0.4019,7
It wasn't clear from the link but what board were you using to push signals to the GC? Looks like a tiny purple board? Something from Adafruit? Very cool project! :),0.9057,35
"I’ll try making one, will be useful for smash tournaments.",0.4404,14
Madmorda I understand... If you decide to sell any though could you let me know? cause these are really cool and inventive. Its a really good idea. If they had wireless and a detachable cable that would be even cooler!,0.7251,45

NomaD7801 Thanks :) it's actually really convenient for testing on,0.7096,11
Now you need to make a tiny gamecube to go with it,0.0,12
"Peter Kozlowski Unfortunately no unless it's just one or two. They just involve so much labor, plus $30 in parts. It's all open source though so you can make your own :)",-0.1531,36

You are one amazing gal Madmorda.,0.5859,7
"Zero Revenger The main problem with that is battery. Even if I could fit a wavebird in there, the battery life would be like two minutes. Plus the signal would be terrible because you need antenna inside :P I've thought about it too though, wireless would be amazing",0.3885,52
"Zero Revenger They're actually a lot of work to build (not to mention kinda expensive) so I'm not sure whether I'll be selling these yet. If I do, it'll only be a couple :)",-0.3238,38

reminds me of that one ctrl alt del comic where he’s holding the tiny controller,0.0,17
"thanks, I really appreciate it :D when I say detachable cable I mean like how some headphones let you remove the cable and use them just wirelessly or reattach it for wired if you prefer. Then this could be even a little smaller and I could use it with Bluetooth for Dolphin. or even RF like a wavebird is cool too. I actually don't care all that much about rumble. but wow I still can't get over how cool it is...",0.944,87
"youtubasoarus It's open source :) you can make your own. It's on github, just search ""gc+ aurelio pcb""",0.4588,23
