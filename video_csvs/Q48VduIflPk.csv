"(This will be a very long comment and if you don't want to hear about Jonghyun YOU SHOULD NOT READ THIS)



It's been like two and a half months since... well you know and i still cry sometimes like that happening would've been yesterday when i see or hear about Jonghyun. It may sound weird or even stupid but i didn't even know about Shinee/Jonghyun until i just saw a post of Shinee in instagram which said something like this ""four humans and one angel"" and i was like what? Then i searched name Jonghyun in google and found out what have happened and i was like okay that's very sad that he did suicide but i was still like it doesn't consern me. But then i was still pretty interested and searched name Jonghyun in youtube and when i saw these videos about how he suffered and how he was so polite and kind towards everyone and so good guy in so many ways it just really got into my feelings. And then i cried a lot and thought that is it okay for me to cry because i didn't even know him until the next day of this happening. I couldn't even watch videos about him because i knew that i would cry a lot but in about four days i decided to watch videos about him because i wanted to know him better and managed somehow to watch many different videos about him and really learned who Jonghyun was. And then i started to listen Shinee and Jonghyun and those Jonhyun's vocals were amazing. Okay I'm ending this comment now because it's so long already. I'm listening Shinee or just Jonghyun almost everyday now and waiting to see/hear new music from Shinee😘 Thanks if you really read this all.",0.9698,321

Feliz porque al fin Jonghyun oppa esta descansando en paz los idols apoyan a Jonghyun y lo extrañan igual q nosotras el fue un gran cantante y sera un gran angel aunque ya lo era :')
Triste porque no lo tenemos aqui pero para mi es mejor porque el no encontro la felicidad aqui y ahora si pq el esta en el cielo cuidandonos 




Yo lo conoci desde q tenia memoria :) se que suena falso pero es vdd, el me iso feliz junto a SHINee y ahora yo siempre lo quiero ver feliz
Ahora lo es y estoy orgullosa de el pq iso un gran trabajo :'c a el no le gusta q estemos llorando por el





Desde ese maldito día e llorado  muchas noches y muchos días



Recuerden el nos quiere y nos quería ver feliz
¿Pq ahora el no lo puede hacer?
El es feliz en el cielo :')
Nos esta cuidando y guiando 






Jonghyun............TE AMOOO!!
ERES EL MEJOR CANTANTE Y EL MEJOR ÁNGEL AHORA SERAS PARTE DE LOS ÁNGELES MAS ESPECIALES PARA MI 


MUCHO AMOR A SHINEE 




Esto es algo q todo idol sufre 
:( ellos sufren de depresión o ansiedad

Hay q apoyarlos en todo pero en TODO si tiene un@ novi@ ay q apoyarlos
Si se va del grupo ay q apoyarlos 
Y si se va de este maldito mundo ay q apoyarlos, apoyar a su familia y a sus amigos, apoyar a las fans. 




Jonghyun lo hiciste bien :)

Te extrañaremos  :'(",0.7199,270

"I am sad to see Jonghyun but also sad watching the absence of TVXQ.
After JYJ left SM, SM Town are not very active in making album. I think they change their concept into concerts more. Previously, they were usually having album in summer or winter with music video where all SM artist gather to film it. Previously there was not even SNSD, but now SNSD is a sunbae in the industry.
When I saw Kangta, BoA, and Super Junior with only few members in this video, I realize how much I grow up with SM Town.",-0.47,109

Why they let him alone ? how kpop can continue their life without him? , I can't  even do like them ..I know it is bad to blame them but I reached a point that I blame myself at .. I couldn't study, everynight that I planed to study at , I just spent it crying .. you know , I'll tell you a secret , I tried to kill myself today ... I just want to get rid of it all and finally be with my angel ... I can't bear it , it's the first time for me to try losing someone .. I am even a new shawol and I didn't like my angel when I first saw him but after this I really really loved him , loved his voice and I didn't expect  losing him at all , I didn't expect losing anyone of my angels ...I think I just should spend my life listening to  his voice and watching his beautiful smile with alot of tears and alot of pain or be with him watching his smile with happeness tears ...
