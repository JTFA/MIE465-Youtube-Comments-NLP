Her lyrics are usually relatable and well-written and I feel she gets way too much shit for writing about love and dating when everybody in pop does that, too (looking at you, Ed Sheran). The only thing I actually respect is that she’s really given up on the victim-role she gets shoved into a lot and just goes full “villain” saying “fuck you guys, I don’t care anymore”. I love that she’s not trying to be nice on this record. Not saying it’s good, as I said, I’m disappointed. But it’s different at least? It kinda grows on you.",0.9345,144

"Every time I comment something on his videos disagreeing with him I get a handful of people that insult me. I really like his channel and respect his opinion, I know she's not for everybody. I do want to post her prologue for reputation because I think it helps you understand it better. I think he reviewed her character a bit and kinda let that get in the way of the music is all. So here it is if anyone cares! 

""Here's something I've learned about people.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.

This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.

When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?

Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.

There will be no further explanation.
There will be just reputation.""",0.9978,667

Even as a hardcore Swifty, I can at least acknowledge why people hate ""Look What You Made Me Do"" and ""...Ready For It?"" from an objective point of view. But the rest of the album goes a lot stronger, and ends with two of the best songs she's ever penned.",0.9324,115

"I don't really get why people do these reviews or listen to these kind of reviews. Even if someone parades their opinion around as being subjective, they are biased. What it mostly gets down to is just personal opinion and everyone has their own standards. Why make a review on something you knew you didn't have interest in? I was never a Taylor swift fan until this album. Its pretty much genius. Its a very wholesome consistent album and the narrative IS what makes it wonderful. That has and still is Taylors swift charm. The song melts into each other.  I felt like there was a lot of deep introspection. I think the synths and dubstep made the sound interesting. IF it was too hard an punchy, it would be horrible. I did not find it bland. I found that it added enough edge, and keep the songs at a good pace.The slight mechanical sounds sound cold and are is seems to represent her change in attitude, thats kind of developed into her own ruler. It represents her shedding herself from the sweet girl image and not being concerned about her reputation. While at the same time, her obsession with love and dating keeps it warm.  In the video for ready for it she's half cyborg, its what she was going for. This album is absolutely consistent. Theres a reason why she is a leading artist in this generation and with the help of her producer who is also lauded as a pop mastermind, they really made a strong album to represent her and what she stands for, her reputation. And with any reputation, theres people that will see something for the reputation and there will be people that see something for what it is and its intent. Just like you admitted in the video, Taylor swifts reputation ""preceded her"". 

  Ive watched a couple of his reviews from time to time and I see that he tries, but you can see that he just doesn't get some artist or their statement so disregards the music. So I think ill stop watching these reviews. I think he got it totally wrong. I find them pretentious and more obnoxious then songs like bad blood (and if you didn't like that song you probably just don't like TF music) but y'all know thats just his opinion right, even if its irritating? Its a waste to watch reviews its entirely subjective. If an album resonates with you it will and if it won't it won't.
