"?? I think the idea of robbing the met gala is quite entertaining. If this was a oceans movie with the original male cast with the same premise, I'd enjoy it too. Many of the actresses in this movie are phenomenal, multi-award winning performers (just googled it, cate blanchett has more award wins and nominations than matt damon and george clooney combined) and I'm sure they're going to do a great job on this film. Why does the gender of the characters bother you so much? the fact that the original movies starred men didn't have any relevance to the plot of the films.

here's a comment I found below:

See the problem with Ghostbusters (2017) was that the cast was trash and the movie was not funny. It had nothing to do with the female leads. This movie may very well be good because it has a talented cast of women, a solid plot and it‚Äôs a spin off of a really great movie series. Not a remake like ghostbusters. A spin off. Much easier for audiences to swallow a new story rather than a remake of a beloved one.",0.9922,219

"I am so freaking tired of these role reversal movies. If you want to make cool female characters FINE, but do it on your own merit and stop just remaking movies and switching out females for males and vice versa. Its so clickbaity. Its shameful. I hate this. It's like watching a forum rant about how said male character would be better as a female, some gender-bender fantasy gone rapid.  I'm sure there are plenty of writers out there with great stories ready to be adapted. If you really want to make money off this feminist crap, then grab one of their stories and put it up. Please god, no more Twilight or other form of trash. I mean actually good female stories... here are a few examples if you need some help for interesting female characters in movie: A Long Kiss Goodnight, Tomb Raider (meh), Salt (meh),  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (1 & 2), Alien Quadrilogy, Terminator Series and so on. Come on! If you want to actually do this, do it right! I have been begging on my hands and knees for females to get a shot but this is NOT the way. And I will not let Hollywood SCREW THIS UP and not make a fuss!!! Do you know what makes strong female characters so freaking cool, they're not the majority. The rarity is what makes them so cool. The struggle, the drive, the motives and etc. that made them go beyond stereotypes and so on in order to be ""stronger"" or rather ""their own knight in shinning armor"". No, they don't have to be gay, bisexual, butch or even just NOT GIRLY, they just have their own tale to tell. But don't rip off some good classics and cover up somebody elses hardwork and throw females into it. Hollywood, you're cheap and I always knew you were cheap but I expected better.
