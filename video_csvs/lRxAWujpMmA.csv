The reason is that there is a program of genocide going on in EVERY White country and ONLY in White countries.

"That's... not what he's saying at all. Darren has never downplayed how utterly deplorable Cunanan's actions were, nor the fact that he clearly had an extremely unstable personality. That's why he prefaced the analogy he made with the fact that *obviously* , being a jerk to someone is not even remotely in the same realm as being a murderer. But his point was simply that, even with someone like Cunanan whose worst actions were just horrific and deplorable, there were still whole portions of his life growing up where there was more to him than simply the monster he became. And I don't think that's even to suggest that he was ever a particularly good person, because obviously, even the capability for murder aside, he was always extremely narcissistic and felt he deserved some extravagant life without ever having to work for it. But still, even with that and the severe lack of empathy, he did have human desires like anyone else... the desire to stand apart from the crowd, the desire to feel loved... 

So Darren is just saying that, from an acting perspective, those are the things he tapped into. Because if you never look any father than ""this was an evil person who had absolutely nothing to him other than evilness and lack of empathy!"", that's going to be a VERY one-note and boring performance. Instead, you still have to think of this person who did horrendous things as still human, and find the commonalities where you can go ""you know what? As completely psychopathic as it is to actually ACT on those feelings... I've been somewhere in the vicinity of that mindset also. Even if only for a second, I've gone to those dark places too before snapping back to my senses and my empathy.""",-0.9849,335

Ironically despite the fact that he's an actor this guy seem incapable of recognizing Cunanan's lack of empathy.  The fact that he's going to such lengths to portray this confirmed serial killer as someone who just had a bad Monday is absurd.  Considering he's currently portraying him on the FX series, you'd think he would have a better understanding of the legit, violent motivations of Cunanan.",-0.9708,109
