"""One Sample it on the cotton fields of the Indies"" you know I was laughing at your comment until I had to really digest what he said he basically talking about raping slaves on the field and going home to your white wife. so in his own sick twisted way he is attracted to her but he will never wife her because of what she is.",-0.2617,70

"""Samples it on a cotton field..."" Going to assume that's code for ""forcing himself on a slave"". James Ashford is clearly one of those men who finds Black women sexually desirable however because of his prejudice upbringing by Mother Ashford, he's clearly in denial about it. My theory is proven in a scene later on in the movie where James sexually assaulted Dido. The way James sexually assaults Dido shows his sexual desire for her. That scene is good example of how a slave master possibly view his black female slaves.",0.2732,102

"janna bacani Learn the meaning of the word racist before throwing it out there like a rag towel. It would also be in your best interest to educate yourself on slavery and how African or African American women slaves were subjected to rape and sexual assault by the master and/or the masters family and associates. Black women were seen as nothing more than bed warmers and chattel mules to  white male in those times. It is NOT compliment to a black women (or any woman but let's stay in context) to call her exotic or a rarity (based on race and physical makeup, not character) when the original bud of those thoughts comes from lust and the desire to *taste* dark flesh. 

House slaves and outdoor slave women were raped repeatedly due to the thinking above and the child of the slave master and slave woman were treated no better. 
It is not generalization but there are white men today who still think same. That's reality. 
For some white men, dark skin insights lust and eroticism and it has nothing to do with respect or respectful desire for said woman. 
It is a disgusting notion and abhorrent in nature. None of that is racist. It is history and it truth.",-0.6776,231
