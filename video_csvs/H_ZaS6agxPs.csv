But these videos your making is actually helping me so so much💕🙏🏻 thank you so much🌷❣️ i don’t know if you’ll ever read this from your hundreds of comments but if you do can you please interview a fashion merchandiser or a fashion buyer or even another fashion director and ask them what they actually do. I know you’ve made a video similar to this last season but I want to know more. Like what they do in the offices how they make products or how they do buying. Thank you🌷🌷,0.9559,148

"Thank you for your reply, I think what you do is the right thing. Figuring out what you exactly want and what your talents are before even starting uni. I didn't do this enough because in school I focused on getting the best grades in all classes and decided after one internship that architecture is the right thing to do, and this subject is so time consuming and competitive that it is hard to step away from when you invested so much in it.",0.9169,89
