I know you probably aren't that concerned with the efficiency or how hot the outside gets but you really should break your bond   so on the wool add another layer with the seam in a different location and if you are concerned with losing your internal diameter you could go with thinner wool. You should also break your bonds where your walls meet the floor for example layer of wool on the floor then one layer to the walls then the second to the floor then the second to the walls the point being there isn't a straight break in insulation leading to the shell. Would also recommend useing stainless fastener. Anyway just 2 cents from someone who does it for a living(industrial level) so if you need material or anything hit me up.,-0.1025,141
