"Really good movie.
 One complaint ...the Amazon alternate movie... Is a scam. It plays all the way to the ending the same...then the credits...then there's 4-5 mins of Peele talking OVER the alternate ending and he explains it instead of letting u hear what they say. The alternate ending is when they drive away at the end...instead...he strangled her till she's dead then the cop car pulls up and it's NOT lil rel.... But two white cops and he's arrested for her murder and 6 months later lil rel goes to visit him and he's content that he killed the evil white family.and he walks off. That's it. 4-5 mins u can't hear cuz Peele is talking over the whole scene. Amazon got me for a 2nd 14.99!(?scam?)
