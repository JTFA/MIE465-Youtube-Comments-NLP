Also, they could just farm for food, which they do as shown by the ranches with the rhinoceroses. I may just be saying the same thing over and over, I don't know, but I do disagree that their economy would crash, as it is and will continue to flourish, whether or not they decided to give support and vibranium to other countries, as they have barely scratched the surface of their vibranium supply.",0.5816,188

"Dear Theorist, I'm an Indian, a student of Commerce, a fan of IronMan and someone who hasn't watched Black Panther yet. I just want to rewatch this video considering the following things-
1. Iron Man, in MCU, could not make anything comparable to Vibranium inspite of having a good amount of knowledge about even in and after situations like in those of movie Age of Ultron, and keep in mind that Stark likes to be prepared but yet he could not ever make anything that could stand against Vibranium. Point being, if stark and Reed cannot manufacturers an alternative to the metal then, no one can and you know why.

I have the idea from watching the trailers that Wakandan's are pretty technologically advanced and Wakanda is a great tourist place. So I think, even if the metal goes cheap or even extinct, The Economy would survive. I mean they can just patent their technological discoveries and earn from them. ok I'm hungry now, bye",0.9643,184

The fight is about the coup d'etat and not over the metal, fun fact aside, as so often the CIA is on the plan when a sovereign country elects a government that isn't in favor of US interests (Chile, Guatemala,etc). 
Furthermore what will happen if the rest of the world finds out, that Wakanda has allways had the technology to stop the europeans and the USA from having people as property, could stop the holocaust or nearly every epedemic ? And what happens to Wakanda when pharmaceutical companies find out what healing power exists! And the real logical problem is why has Wakanda the more developed technology from an asteroid material that makes weapons computer healing... How can one metal do everything? or is the metal just the energy and they developed everything allone? What is with the farming people outside of the shield? That is also Wakanda!

Number 2. Wakanda's economy is not actually based the export of vibranium. It is based on the technological advances which are made possible by vibranium.   It is actually a sealed economy. Like the family in Swiss family Robinson. To create everything they need with no interaction for the rest of the world. The problem is that history has shown this leads to technological delay, Not advancement. Intellectual Commerce is the root of all technological advancement. The exchange of ideas from one place and 1 people to another leads to the exponential increase in ideas.  Without that intellectual Commerce, Many societies have failed to even invent the wheel.

"Hey! Venezuelan here. This made me cry for multiple reasons: 1.- The fact that someone is actually factually reporting on what happens to us and in some ways, this has been more through-rough than a lot of journalist. 
2.- Because it reminded me of exactly how bad this is, with no end on sight. :( 

Just to fact-check/expand on context: Venezuela did have a real, albeit imperfect democratic system from 58-98... The year we elected that asshole Hugo Chávez. And to be fair, plenty of people-both local and immigrants- profited: there was more social mobility and the opportunity to study, get good jobs, make a living, take care of your family, etc. Venezuela was much like the US, a migration magnet. 

And food scarcity started in 2007: milk was one of the first things to go. The thing is that because of the high oil prices is like they could keep cooking in spite of a gas leak, but eventually you rub out of gas. 

The thing about controlling of the 1 resource=control of the population is true. Is like how abusive partners will try to prevent their victims from having their own money or take away any income they generate so as to keep them subdued. 

The Venezuelan government is responsible for people not finding food, but they will SELL you boxes of government selected food for you. So, also Maslow’s pyramid: you keep people from being able to protest because they’re relying on that food box you sell them. And government officials are the ones who import that food and make money off of it.",-0.484,312

"I hate to piss on your parade but your theory about the relationship between single-item economies and dictatorships is not factually accurate. The countries you listed -- Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, have had, for multiple generations, dictatorships forced upon them, or at least promoted from without. If you knew anything about history or Marxism, this would not be a surprise to you. It has long been the habit of nations like England, France, and the US to promote internal unrest leading to dictatorships in nations where they have a vested interest in extracting resources below fair or free market prices: this used to be known as colonialism or imperialism. Russia is 100% more democratic than it was a century ago. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy created by Britain which has been part of a European anti-Democracy movement ever since the American Revolution. Venezuela, like its neighbor Colombia, suffers from its proximity to the US. Sure, there is a tendency for weak people to seek power in order to exercise what they lack in themselves over the majority of their population, but no government has ever existed by or for one megalomaniac: all structures of authority are seated on the satisfaction of the economic drive of its backers, no Caesar could rule without the permission of the Praetorian guard and the Senate. Liberals, being less educated than many, tend to worship the words and ideas of people they ""feel"" are correct, ie Macchiavelli (who did not author the quote you cited, that was Lord Acton), just because many things they say are correct or are derived from correct information does not mean that their conclusions are correct or that their analysis is correct. People like Stalin and Mao did not rule by themselves, both were nearly ""overthrown"" many times and even Stalin lived in fear of the some of the people in his government, probably the ones that murdered him. But then again, Americans have never been very good at understanding people, things, movements that they don't ""feel"" like caring about, it is a real weakness that has left our nation susceptible to outside agitation and manipulation. Our ""anti-communist"" strategy was to kill as many people we needed to win over to ""our"" side, and disengage the enemy everywhere where they are actively working to undermine our national integrity. But, hey! We won the Cold War, right? Russia is no longer a threat and China is a democracy and a close ally now.",-0.963,473
"I highly suggest anyone interested in this topic read the book ""Why Nations Fail"" by t Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson.  They present the exciseive (sp?) institutional theory as their explanation for why nations fall into this trap. Essentially demonstrating that when your government has democratic political and economic institutions your nation will do well. When it does not it will ultimately fail as a small select group of oligarchs consolidate their power and extract all of the nations resources. in the case of South America and Africa many of these institutions were sadly built upon the framework laid down by colonial powers; how, after they were ousted, were only replaced by others who continued to process.

"That was the whole point of King Killmonger's rule was that he wanted to share the resources with those who are less fortunate and the oppressed. So in some way, if he hadn't taken over, Wakanda would have gone down the route that MatPat was talking about.

"The one fault in this. The biggest, is that the belief that Vibranium is their only export. But even then Wakanda is an isolationist nation. They have other resources, they don't trade like North Korea does with China. Also for all we know like how Wakanda has highly advanced technology they can trade their knowledge. Also how *spoiler alert* Shuri was able to heal Agent Ross within less than 2 days. So Wakandans probably could trade an exotic good source, most likely not one that makes you enhanced like Captain America, but still very rare foods. Wakandan is an ancient untapped by Europe or the rest of the world nation, they can probably 3D print their meals or create them from photons like Star Trek for all we know. And like how Whales were/are endangered. There are probably many rare animals and plant life in Wakanda to also trade. So with or without the world until there's more data on it Wakanda can stand on its own without the other 300 or so nation's on the planet. So much to that fact, that in Marvel there's a literal Wakanda style planet colonized by T'challa's ancestors probably thousands of years ago and they named it Bast after their primary dirty, the Panther Goddess. One way or another Wakanda endures. Even if it is in some crazy comic book based universe where buildings drop on people breaking all of their bones and show up 2-3 movies later in an exo-suit with C4 strapped to their chest just in case Cap. America kicks their ass.",-0.9313,288

Also, the thing about Wakanda is that they actually dont have trade because they just dont need them. Thei are a 100% self sufficient nation, thanks to all the technological advances
What the film talks about is that CORRUPTION can get even to a nation where no one needs anything, but no, Wakanda would never enter an economic crisis because they are their own economy",-0.5954,129
Ummmm. No. Just No.,-0.5267,7
"Unfortunately, you are incorrect. Here’s why. Your examples are too limited in scope. They only cover recent economic structures with basically the same political structures. You only assume that wakanda is similar.  It is not a dictatorship, ( remember killmonger). FYI, there have been a number of civilizations that have provided for their citizens for thousands of years without dictatorships. They just don’t talk about them in schools, so you may not have ever heard of them.
Two, the examples you cited have resources that have only one or two uses. Vibranium has a wide variety of uses. An element that cannot be reproduced in Starks lab.( it comes from outer space). Top scientists and engineers still can’t figure out how the Mayans knew about aeroponics, how the dogon saw the Sirius Star without a telescope , or how the pyramids of Giza were built. 
Vibranium, on the other hand, Is a food, a metal, energy, clothing, it can heal the human body, it is a weapon, and a plant. 
Three, we don’t know enough about how wakanda actually works to speculate about what can happen to it. It is an unknown. But I like that you tried. Great video! Keep them coming.",0.884,248

Heck they most likely have endless supply of food and water, and medicine isn't even needed thanks to those beeds. The question isn't how will their economy will fall, it's how over populated these guys are. Think about it while they do have spies all around the world the population of wakanda should be over it's limits due to their isolation,  do a video on that",0.5915,127
Wakanda isn’t a country though it’s just one city so it can’t quite compare to all these countries that your saying,0.0,27
Wakanda most likely has other resources since they don’t even sell vibranium. Also at the end of the movie they begin to sell their tech which means they will make money off of the vibranium. So they should be fine for a long time. And no one says that it is a command economy. It seems that each tribe leader controls a different aspect so this is kind of wrong but still a good episode,0.3514,81

Your theory falls down in that Wakanda's wealth heretofor is not generated through the trade of a rare commodity. The outside world doesn't even know they have vibranium or anything beyond simple grazing and agriculture. Their wealth comes from the far reaching applications they've derived from the metals better-than-real-life properties. Though for the stuff they would need to trade for either they've got vibranium based replicators or they've been using their cloaks for larceny.,0.802,78
