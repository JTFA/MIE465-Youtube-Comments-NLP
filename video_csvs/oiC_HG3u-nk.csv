"ASK ME SCIENCE QUESTIONS I WILL ANSWER INSTEAD OF WORKING ON MY DUMB ENGLISH PAPER

For those who do not understand climate change: IT IS SCIENCE NOT POLITICS. 
1) Light heats up the planet 
2) Light will interact with the electrons on molecules. Most atmospheric molecules do NOT reflect light (like oxygen) but CO2 DOES causing what is called the greenhouse gas effect.
3) There is natural, balanced system of the carbon exchange system. 

Humans breathing out CO2 and plants ""breathing"" it in to make it O2 (Photosynthesis and Repiration) 
AND carbon on the surface of earth (carbon atoms in animals, plants, etc.) sedimenting onto the ground to later become rock shot out by a volcano or eroded into our atmosphere (sedementation-volcano,weathering). We have set of the imbalance in favor of increase of CO2 in atmosphere.

CONCLUSION: There is more CO2 in the atmosphere reflecting light onto earth which heats up the earth resulting in...... DRUM ROLL PLEASE GLOBAL WARMING",0.9358,188

No, this polar bear isn't like this because of global warming, it's probably just old and sick etc. But yes the ice cap is melting more and more every year and global warming is real and is an issue and can be a potential threat for certain species. Who knows, maybe the polar bear might adapt and survive, but who knows, tbh the seal population is suffering more from consequences from global warming, but the seal population is one of the main food sources for polar bears so they might be indirectly severly endangered by the consequences of global warming.",-0.4588,132
