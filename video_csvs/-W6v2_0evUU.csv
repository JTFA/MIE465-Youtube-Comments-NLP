"Exactly 10 years ago I was supervisor for the cafeteria at Old Faithful in Yellowstone. It was run by Xanterra. One of the assistant managers was let go so someone was moving up and the big manager was certain it was me. The other supervisor was okay, he was nice, but he was a brown noser and didn't do anything. I figured I was a shoe-in. During this time though him and I had to work a lot more to replace the lost worker and we started having to worker closer until one day he started grabbing my ass. I lost a good friend over this, just because it makes me feel... like nothing. I guess it's why people don't like being grabbed like that. But when I went to complain I was told I was being homophobic, and on my day off and the big manager's day off came, the assistant managers who called me homophobic (Two women who made other female employees cry daily) called in HR to make their decision and since I didn't show up they chose the only person who did. Which was him because he was at work. Nobody else was told. Ultimately I lost my job in the end because.. well... when you don't get respected you don't work hard and with child support taking half of what I make, I need an internal goal or reason to work because it's not money. That just gets taken away. That's a whole other thing though, I've been trying to establish paternity since my ex hit me with child support years after the child was born, so I started at negative 35 thousand. I'm now at 60,000 and can't save up the money for the paternity. She isn't helping, she doesn't want it. (Of course, then it would be known it's not my kid) So.. life just sucks.

On a further note, when I was trying to end the relationship with my wife and she became extremely abusive, she raped me quite a few times. She wasn't successful most of the times because she would do so usually by trying to drug me. But when I called the Dakota county police in Minnesota, they told me you can't be raped by your wife, and if we are having family troubles I need to take her to court, and I was locked in the bathroom asking for help. It was the same reply when I found she had stolen all my money and everything I owned actually. But all I could do is take her to family court. I ended up homeless for most of a year instead.",-0.992,488

Also, you then go on to conflate criminal rape with sexual harassment in the workplace. They're not even remotely the same thing. Why do you always jump back and forth between very different things and pretend it's one conversation? You do it all the time. It only works on those who don't pay attention. 

As for ""fear of retaliation,"" it's not unique to sexual harassment. It's the number one reason most crimes don't get reported. It doesn't change the fact that, if I DON'T report my neighbor for doing 90mph in a school zone, I am partially responsible if he does it again and kills someone. Fortunately, those of us in the US have the right to defend ourselves from retaliation with force (up to and including lethal force). If you're really afraid your rapist is going to attack you for reporting them, get a gun so you can show them what unwanted penetration feels like. You know you wish they were dead. If they give you a reason, you can ensure that happens. No need to hope the courts put them away. We need less rapists. Bullets are a viable cure.",-0.9914,265

"I wonder how many people don't report rape because they think the punishment their assaulter would face is too severe.

I think the social stigmas around anything involving sex are way to extreme and a lot of the suffering people go through after sexual assault is caused by social stigmas. We need to start thinking about sex crimes like any other crime. There is no logical reason to treat sexual harassment differently than harassment or sexual assault differently than assault. There is no reason to be more embarrassed by one than the other. We also shouldn't tolerate people who commit violent crimes more than we tolerate people who commit sex crimes or domestic violence. It seems like such a classic American attitude, violence is good sex is bad.

Also, I question the rape statistics this video provides. I don't know what survey was used for the self reported incidents of rape. Leading questions on a survey may also give very skewed results. This video doesn't mention if the victims filed and won a civil case which would be much easier to win than a criminal case.

"While I agree that rape is bad I find one big issue. It is how we define rape. I mean if say two people have consensual sex but then one of them regrets it and convinces him/herself that he/she was raped. How do we prove this in court? Because if the court takes the ""victim's"" side it might be injustice but if it takes the ""offender's"" side it might be a way to leave a crime unpunished. In many cases only the two people involved know what happened and it's actually an argument. The thing about arguments is that both sides are right for themselves. And this can be used by innocent people and criminals alike. Sex is so subjective. I find that fixing this can only be achieved with open mindedness about sex and relationships. Think about it, there would be no rapes if everybody was sexually satisfied, no?",-0.9928,171

"Yeah, don't acknowledge that most rape accusations are false. Don't name your sources or how they got their information because you know that the study is probably inflated for politics. Don't acknowledge the victims who have their lives ruined by false rape accusations. Don't acknowledge that just a week ago a faker was caught trying to slander a senator by the Washington Post. Don't acknowledge these things; just bend over backwards and suck on the lowest common denominator because this is YouTube and you need uneducated chimps to watch your videos.",-0.9665,98
