"""mind gut connection"" well, even though eating artificial sweeteners will trick the mind into eating actual sugar and therefore let the person reach for actual sugar, it doesn't support the fact that ""more calories are absorbed"" when artificial sweeteners are eaten. A burger for example, has 500 cal, how is it possible to absorb more than 500 calories? All calories are absorbed by the body and the body is mechanized to absorb all those calories.",-0.0665,86
