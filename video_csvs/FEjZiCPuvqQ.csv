But they can still be very difficult, and they`re twice as big as most domestic cats too, on average.

"Gen 1? Hoo lawdie. Have a friend in another country with a Gen 3 savannah. That cat is wild enough.
If only more people would realize that hybridism does not domesticate.

(tl;dr topic of animal behavior: )
Wolfdogs are a common enough example of this. Wolf and dog mental wiring are so completely different, it confuses the poor thing. Though it's a starker example than wild and domesticated cats, it's still cruel to the animal. Imagine having horrible mental imbalances and never feeling fulfilled in your life or your environment, and having no proper outlet for it. That's what a wild animal in a cage/too small environment/not enough natural stimuli goes through. Hell, keeping most dog breeds in an apartment all day and giving them only two short walks a day is cruel, but we're so used to it being commonplace that we forget that our pets are not dumb animals... ""A bored pet is a bad pet.""

Basically, I'm just salty that I've had to train and retrain so many friend/family's pets, but the owners don't understand or fix the source of the problems, so the negative behaviors continue.

So much respect to the woman who surrendered Beacher, though. That must've been hard. She clearly tried to care for his wellbeing and loves him enough that she understands he needs something she can't provide.

BCR, take care of that wild kitty! Hopefully his addition to the sanctuary can help educate the public on why pets are NOT mindless house decorations you can pet every once in a while, throw a destructible toy at, and forget. They're living, thinking, feeling creatures like we are.
Also. You know. This one's wild. It needs to stay that way. But that message is par for the course with yall. lol

P.S. Could I make a request that we have a bit of your vlog walkabout screentime on him, for a while? He's adorbs. <3 He's probably so much happier with his new outdoor lifestyle, and the new diet of real, raw, carnivore food. Please show us how he adjusts to that! :)",0.9646,410

"I agree hybrids do not make good pets, it's stressful for the cats being indoors and having to deal with wild instincts with no real prey to chase, and no outlet for their energy, and the owners often get hurt, as well as guests. I've even heard of Hybrids being 'disciplined' in horrible fashion just because they are following their instincts.

"I am planning on being a veterinarian, and I have no clue why so many vets declaw for a quick buck. Declawing actually worsens behavior, as the cat's main defense mechanism is gone, and thus they begin to feel trapped and helpless.

I understand if there is an ingrown claw that needs to be removed because of infection, but most of the time that is not the case. Poor fella.",-0.2831,128

Not all Savannah's are this wild, many are not, but with a hybrid of any wild and domestic animal you're gambling. I've heard people talk about Savannah's as being ""just like dogs"" that you can walk on a leash and have a similar personality too. I even saw a facebook video about it and people, for some reason, soak up those videos like they're fact. People need to know what they're getting into and have a back up plan.

There is no such thing as a domestic cat.,-0.296,10
"These hybrids actually make amazing pets. I whole heartedly support Big Cat Rescue, and they are on a (short) list of charitable organizations I fully intend to support when I can, but... 
Savannah cats are grossly misunderstood by many people, and people don't have the space for such a big animal with so much energy (we don't keep dogs couped up... they need to burn energy, so we walk/run them. But put a leash on a cat? Doesn't work for most!)
They aren't some ""super predator."" Rather than being aggressive, they are actually known for being quite sweet tempered, and even loving (and being entirely safe with) children.

The best reasons to not keep a Savannah are because of meeting their high-energy needs, and food/vet costs being much more than a normal cats, due to special needs. That said? They are a healthy, friendly breed, and while I am thrilled BCR is giving him a home, I can't help but be shocked that no one wanted to take him in.

Why was he a bad pet? It could be his personal nature. All cats have personalities, and some cats, even from friendly breeds, are mean. He could have been scared. Mistreated by the person who owned him before this woman. And he was declawed.... claws are a first line of defense for cats, and all other health issues aside, by declawing him, he was stressed out.
Sure, her story of him sounds like it was horrible to deal with.... but her story does not say why this breed should not be pets. It says, at best, that he was a scared, stressed, damaged cat who felt unsafe, and was the victim of whomever declawed him and owned him previously, leaving him so emotionally scarred... and at worst, that she didn't do the research she thinks she did in order to be a good pet owner (as a diet of meow mix makes me think this could strongly be the case!)
Likely, both.

I'm happy he is safe and secure, but I'm... frustrated that BCR is using him, and the people who simply DO NOT KNOW how to care for cats like him, as a way to push the idea that Savannahs should not be pets, or that, by extension, their breed should not even exist.
He's home now. He's beautiful, and hopefully happy. I have no doubt the wonderful people of BCR will make sure he has a long, good life. But I do wish BCR didn't openly demonize people who would want to make a cat like him a pet.",0.9924,508

"This was a $20,000 exercise in human vanity, nothing more. Buy a human designed and bred, virtually wild animal, then have the poor thing declawed, only to find (surprise!) that he is still not a sweet lil house cat. People like this are infuriating. I come close to hating this sort of uber rich showoff. Human vanity and sheer ego stretched to disgusting levels.",-0.9131,77
"To be honest here, what is being explained is in *no* way anywhere near what your typical Savannah is like actually. While yes you may get a few odd cats who are wild, primal, instinctive, mean, aggressive, etc. technically the Savannah, even an F1, should realistically display very dog-like and social behavior. Savannahs are notorious for their friendly, outgoing personalities and having incredibly strong bonds with their owners and other house members which can include other cats and even dogs. So all in all, Beacher in no way represents what your Savannah typically is like at all.

I am going to point out that I think it is not exactly well-educated to use hybrids in general as a baseline for a specific type. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Big Cat Rescue and wholeheartedly support their work, mission and hopes for big cats, but I am not that much of a follower type where I'll be unable to see when they may simply be just a bit misinformed on something specific. 

Here is actually the personality as explained by TICA, for anyone who wishes to attempt to disprove me or anything:
""One of the most amazing traits of the Savannah is its remarkable personality. It is a very curious, assertive cat that seeks out adventure at every opportunity. It is a very active cat, that needs a great deal of interaction on a daily basis, either with its human family or with a companion cat. It is also a very loyal cat who will bond strongly with its human family. It is not a lap cat, but will show affection on its own terms, often by greeting family members at the door, following them around the house and giving frequent headbutts. Many Savannahs love to play in water. They can easily be trained to walk on a leash with a harness, and most love to play games such as fetch.""

So again, I'm not against BCR but I am willing to point out when they're in the wrong, even if just unintentional. I don't blindly follow, I follow but also provide my own insight when I see or notice something that may seem a bit off and I encourage people to do the same, not blindly follow but be willing to learn on their own as well from more than just a single source.",0.9983,443

Really?), and it sounds like she could have surrendered him sooner, before doing something as cruel as declawing him.

Hybrids don't have good odds for becoming proper house cats. Once a hybrid is born, it deserves care and some sort of home, but the breeding of them needs to stop. Even for Bengals. Just because the cat is pretty, that's not an excuse to keep breeding them.

"Yes it is indeed horrible that she had gotten Beacher declawed, but I find it acceptable to the alternative of Beacher killing his previous owners, or a random visitor to their house, and then being put down for normal wild animal behavior.
Do I support declawing in any capacity, for the most part no, if the cat's claws don't need to be amputated for a legitimate medical reason like a too far in progression infection or cancerous tissue, don't remove them. Get them one of the scratching posts that file their claws down so they aren't so sharp, do it by hand with an actual nail file for all I care.
But if Beacher had indeed mauled someone, as it is implied in the video while he still had his claws, then I don't blame the misinformed owner for declawing him before there was an escalation. At least she had let him keep his claws up until that point, and didn't declaw him for something stupid like he was tearing up her carpet, like so many owners of domestic and even wild cats do. She did it for the safety of humans and animals, which I can respect at least.",0.9709,218

"nimedhel09 Um FYI A Savanah like Breacher is a F1 Savanah ie 50% wild 50% domesticated and from what I've learned from listening to his owner is what she did by declawing(I don't know why that this practice is still allowed to be done here in the US when the rest of the world has made it illegal to declaw cats.) him may have been the reason why Breacher is be having like he did. And if I were to get more on her lifestyle like her schedule with how long she's at work and spent at home working with Breacher I'm quite curtain that he wouldn't of been doing the things she said he did. 

The Problem here is that it is not that any Hybrid cats do not good pets. But inexperienced owners who didn't do the full research on the type of cat breed that they plan on getting as well as doing a full background check into the breeder they're getting the cat from by checking to if they're certified for the breed. 

I'm no expert on Savanah Cat breed but what I know is cats for I've cared for more cats in my life(so far) and what they taught me is that cats will be cats and not all cats' personalities are the same.
