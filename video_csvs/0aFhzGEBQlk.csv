On one the picture would shrink rapidly with heat, and on the others the red color would grow in brightness until it popped up superbright and caused the device to shut down. Even before that happened, it was not possible to achieve a pure black level. They exhibited plenty of moire which appeared as elliptical bands. In the 1990s, computer graphics often used dither patterns with pixels alternating on and of to workaround limited color depth and as a convenient way to shade an image halfway, and moire was visible clearly. Horizontal lines did appear better defined, but diverged in corners in color.

An LCD gave much improvement in text and GUI quality, expecially considering the poor black level I observed on the Trinitrons. The Dell Trinitrons with this problem where the Flat ones.",0.2293,203

"I remember the color televisions from the 1960's were really terrible. On the backs of each set was a large block of convergence controls which would be used to aim the three electron guns at the pixels on the phosphorus screen. On many of the sets these controls were right out in the open so any kid (or supposed grownup) could adjust them and totally screwed up the picture. Thus you would get a screen of all blue or all red with an occasional green human on screen. Then around 1970, Sony came out with its Trinitron picture tube. This was really the first time I saw real color television. In 1972 when I was in the Air Force I bought a little 12 inch Sony. The television was amazing. I drug it along with me from base to base and even had my mother package it up and send it to me through the post office. I continued using it almost daily up until 2002 (30 years) when I sold it for 5 bucks at a garage sale.

While hardly noticeable on TV's the much sharper image of computer monitors made the shadow they cast upon the screen (large areas of white being worst) equally as frustrating to me as dead pixels on an LCD or screen burn on a plasma or OLED.

"Some of the responses to your article made me laugh especially when I hear that my ""first TV was a Sony Trinitron"".  Just how old are you, 10?  Well, I'm nearly 70 and was also a TV technician for many years.  And I also sold/serviced Sony. I realize, of course, that your article specifically zeroed in on Trinitron, however you failed to mention the many improvements TV picture tubes from other manufacturers have made throughout the years.   The most significant improvement actually came from Zenith, which I also sold and serviced,  with the introduction of their Chromacolor picture tube in the early 70's.  In 1978 they introduced the Extended Field Lens [EFL] in-line  Chromacolor picture tube with amazing focus, sharpness, brightness and detail, and competed quite successfully with your almighty Sony with picture and reliability, not price.  And Zenith also invented the completely Flat High Tension Picture tube [not Sony as many thought] and won an Emmy Award for its design. Even though I sold Sony, I preferred the Zenith for many reasons.  Especially when the Japanese  dumped their product on the U.S. market to undermine the American electronic industry.  Thanks, NAFTA.
Wow.  10 years out of a Sony and everyone thinks they were the greatest.  Zenith was known for the reliability and quality of their products and 15 to 20 or even 30 years was not and is not, uncommon. It was the way they were made.  And that includes my 1978 Zenith System Three still in my Living room.  Clearly, the best Zenith ever! Logically made, designed to be reliable, easy to service if and when necessary, quality components and a support network that supported their product for decades, made Zenith  the TV to beat.  Made better than any other tv. Sure, they had their problems as they all do, including Sony.  And Sony realized Zenith was the one to beat in the U.S. Yes, Sony was good but not my favorite.  Hard to service with complicated circuits that only the Sony engineer could understand how they worked.  Odd and complicated with redundant circuitry that went around in circles.  Ask any serviceman.  So, you can keep your Sony;  I'll take my Zenith anyday.  ""The Quality Goes In Before The Name Goes On"".  No truer words ever spoken.",0.9693,448

"Sony's always had technological MARVELS that were commercial flops. In fact nearly all of them are like that. They're terrible at marketing and they never license their technology so only they can make that product. Unlike PCs, VHS machines, etc. If you wanted a Betamax machine? It HAD to be made by Sony. Apple is killing itself the same way.",-0.5672,69
"Sony's timing wasn't good. Archaic patent laws enabled them to stifle the entire television market for 20 years past the point it should have been, ensuring that only the wealthiest could afford their version and nobody else was able to develop a competing technology. This is the problem when it turns out that there is only one effective way to overcome particular technical challenges. Imagine if Sony are the first past the post in inventing warp travel. If no other means of exceeding the speed of light exists, should the whole planet be held to ransom by Sony for 30 years?",0.3387,108
"Speaking of vibrations causing a problem, the speakers built into the tv set can cause distortion at higher volume levels, either on the common CRT or Trinitron.  You may also notice distortion on modern flatscreen computer monitors if the speakers are placed too closely, and are resonating at certain frequencies that make the pixels 'buzz' on screen, warping the image in a sense.  All screens are susceptible to unwanted noise coming from the audio source, since the vibrations move components out of alignment at certain frequencies, it's just how the screen compensates for this that changes how much display is affected.   speakers, in particular the unshielded kind, can certainly ruin a CRT, especially the center speaker that's usually placed on top of the case from a home theater set, it'll dramatically pull the phosphorus to the top, causing a permanent green hue.  With modern flatscreens like LED models, this is no longer the case, since the LEDs aren't dependent on phosphorus to display a picture.",0.4404,185

"Taking comments out of context can be dangerous.  You perceived that section as me being rude, but since you had no prior knowledge of the videos that came before this one, you wouldn't know of my struggle with trying to find a way to explain that the grid of squares in a slot-mask CRT is only a side-effect of way color is made, and not a grid of addressable picture elements.  As Trinitron doesn't have a grid _at all_ it was hopefully easier to understand, and I was perhaps a little too zealous in my reveal.
Can I change how you perceived that? No.  But I can at least provide you with the context that you admit you don't have so you can perhaps see this from my side.  When you're not able to make yourself understood it's very frustrating.",-0.7275,152

"There's one thing I don't understand. From what you're saying, Trinitron used 1 electron gun for all 3 colours, so I assume the beam switched between RGB signals in time for every vertical phosphor line to receive the charge as dictated by that signal. So... why do you need an aperture grille at all then? Is it simply because the beam could not be focused enough and not having a grille would cause it to excite the adjacent phosphors as well?

Btw, I had an Iiyama Vision Master Pro 413 computer screen when I was in uni, and it had an aperture grille as well. It had two shadows running horizontally from the stabilisation wires. But even for computer purposes, it never really bothered me. It was one of the best screens at the time. Except maybe for Eizo, but they were ridiculously expensive.",0.4229,160

"This is one of the best educational channels on youtube. The only fault I can find with this video is the blue shirt. It's against a blue background, to discuss how bright and colorful Sony's Trinitron tube was.

I briefly replaced it with a 20"" SGI display made by mitsubishi i got for $5 that i modified to accept a RGBHV input, but went back to the trinitron because fishbowl CRTs suck. it probably clocked up over 100,000 hours of use in it's time. i eventually upgraded to a 21"" HP P1130 trinitron display, which i reluctantly gave away when i upgraded to a 24"" LCD.

"Well. I was given a 34""  Trinitron, assembled in Mexico in 2006. It runs like brand new, no glitches at all, but it weights 200 Lbs.

In that hospice, nobody could turn it on WITHOUT the RC, so after 6 years being abandoned in a corner, the manager decided to throw it away, I got news of it and called to pick it up, bought a new RC.  Now one electronic engineer tells me (I have to see it to believe it). The manufacturers of TVs are planning to bring back the CATHODE RAY TUBE TVs. Because LCD, LED Flat TVs are not that good, parts are very expensive, hard to get and technicians do not want to touch them. It cost $1600.oo in 2006. So now i have a good TV for the next 30 years.

"When i worked for Sony the biggest complaint of their Trinitron tv's was the stabilization wire.  There were quite a few returns because they noticed the wire and it was a challenge to educate customers the benefits of the technology... when there's 2 lines in their screen.  When LCD displays came out sony had a huge flaw in their LCD technology is that many of the displays only lasted so long then they would fade to white when turned on.  Of course WE knew but we did not disclose this to customers as the company policy was ""There are no known issues"". If a recall happened it would have destroyed the company,  because it was every single older generation LCD TV and monitor produced  some just lasted longer than others. Internet was still young and there was not really resources for people to compare and complain or ask for help.  So it kept under wraps and finally made good with future designs and technologies.  Now I own a OLED bravia tv and it never gets turned off   its been on for 5 years straight.  It uses so little electric i just don't bother turning it off.  Many of the older panels were sold off to other smaller, no-name tv companies so someone else could have the mess.",-0.0762,232

You keep mentioning the Convergence problems of Shadowmask tubes but the key thing is they could be adjusted out after the tube was made using all the coils and magnets on the back of the tube. The big problem with Chromatron was that if there was a convergence problem at the end of the manufacturing process then the tube was only fit for the bin. That is why they were selling the Chromatron sets at a loss. Beam Index would have been the best solution but the electronics weren't up to it until 1989s Indextron.,0.2732,99
