"0680496 Bill picks the right players, not necessarily the best ones. He drafts/signs guys that are self motivated, so that he can focus on X/O's. That's why he's more successful than any other coach ever. He puts the rah-rah stuff on the players, and strictly preaches about execution and mindset. He expects that players are intrinsically motivated.",0.7734,69

It's important what you say not the decibels you deliver it with.....best proof? Watch his speech before Super Bowl against Eagles....,0.6908,25
"Love him or hate him, his speech doesn't need to be motivational because it's the truth. It's more of a mentality than anything else, both Saban and Belichick share this mindset. It doesn't matter about the past or the future, only the present. Play 100% that day and the rest will fall into place.",0.745,62
