Always find room in your heart to forgive those in your path or work respect of what you do and no matter where you live or whatever your race... This life is just a mere test for the life after. If you struggling its only because your nice and god tests those who are nicer unfortunately but your reward for your patience in this world and your only stress is people who are manipulated to think negatively about you..be wise either make and effort or just be cool otherwise you'll never make any progression.. I appreciate not everyone I personally see on a daily basis likes m but who cares i just make the effort and that's all you can do.. I just think personally its the best way as your being genuine if not their loss not yours. Don't blow money on materialistic products as they don't mean nothing and have no value...spend it on yourself and just look good best way of getting attention without holding massive debts besides your name..don't fall for the fake lifestyle they portray on TV as its pointless and your never gonna light and day even if you had it...its an illusion in reality you cam get anyone you want without the rubbish as honesty is the main THiNg tv never talks about and hey guess what solves 100% of your problems...problem solved...hope your good...make your money go future..i have rich cousins ans advise them not to blow money...it ain't cool ma'an especially when their are far better things or people you cam help around you...peace...üòéüë™üëç‚úå 100,0.9953,295

You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
No, don't give me your name
No, I don't need your number saved in my phone
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home
Wanna take off my rings in my California King
Let me get you alone
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
Let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this feelin'
High up as the ceilin'
Let's just, let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this moment
We can make it last
Let's just feel this feelin'
Right now, right now

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love

You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
I can feel every breath on the edge of my neck
Cigarettes and cologne
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home
No, I don't know the time and I don't know what's next
But I know that it's on
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Future]
Let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this feelin'
Try our best to seal it
Let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this moment
We can make it last
Let's just feel this feelin'
Right now, right now

[Chorus: Tinashe &¬†Future]
You on that faded love, love

You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love

[Verse 3: Future]
Before I give my white cup up
Before I give my white girl up
Before I give my half-Dominican girl up, I need real love
I'm on my fourth stripper of the day
I keep a full thoroughbred Jamaican
I'ma find your G-spot like you dropped your location
Man I'ma give all this shit up one day
Get some love from a video vixen on the runway
You can't hold it against a king, baby
You shoulda made me better, what I need
You shoulda upgraded me already
You shoulda made love to me already
I done spent a million on you already
I done bought diamonds for you already
If you love, you can teach me, wanna learn
Take you farther than Jerusalem when it's my turn
We so spiritually connected
We goin' in the right direction

[Chorus: Tinashe &¬†Future]
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
