"@Screenjunkies news: Yeah. She co-produced a bunch of Spielberg films. What exactly were her contributions? What did she bring to the table that comes even close to what Feige did? I don't know. Please educate me. I know what she brought to the Star Wars table: 6 female writers (out of 8) that filled Star Wars stories with political messages and t-shirts saying ""The Force is Female"" when nobody claimed it was male in the first place.

Feige was working with a bunch of B and C list comic characters that he turned into household names and unprecedented merchendize sales. Kennedy was working with some of the greatest characters in US movies and she made them unlikable and unsaleable.

When Black Panther makes records with Advance Ticket Sales and Han Solo is afraid to put out a trailer... you don't expect their producers to be in the same league.

So yeah. If you wanna delude yourself into thinking that Kennedy is some sort of visionary genius, fine by me. But don't mention her alongside Feige, the guy who redefined a producer's role in franchise filmmaking.",0.7844,206

It’s not just the honor of DC. I’m a comic book fan.

That being said, this touches back into the video where X-men just don't fit the MCU imo.

"Gotham should have been a Michael Mann or Martin Scorsese kind of crime drama that was primarily about corrupt police, an out of control mob scene, and with some more grounded versions of proto-villains from Batman's rogue's gallery. It should have found a tone from the first shot that would remain consistent, it should have known what audience it wanted, and it should have mapped out good characters to throw at each other through the conflict of such a broken city. 

Instead we have a show that shifts tone from moment to moment, going from a light and campy updating of the silliness of the 60s Batman to suddenly being an incredibly violent and sadistic horror flick. The characters are overdramatic and underdeveloped, the plot takes nonsensical turns all the time, and good talent is going to waste. Ben McKenzie can act. Donal Logue can really act. Sean Pertwee can act. Morena Baccarin can act. David Mazouz is shaping up to be a good actor, too. The set designs are there, the cinematography is good, the production value is there. The music is even fun, though quite campy.

"House of Cards the American version should have tried to do something like the British version for its season two ""To Play the King.""

In the American one she can then capitalize on that for power for herself. ** Oh and if someone thought the American version of politics was hard to keep up with, I can't imagine the fun they would have with the British one. I knew about it only as a hardcore Angolophile, English History major,  and insomniac, who used to do things like watch the PMs Question Time on CSPAN (I highly recommend this actually.

"I just have to say that anyone who truly thinks MCU wasn't planning for this, and Kevin isn't just trolling the media outlets haven't really been looking into clearly. I've said time and time again, and will yet again here. Marvel gave us the FULL confirmation the MINUTE they released the Marvel Legacy comics. In the opening issue the featured the return of the canon time-line Wolverine, and the ""First Family"" Fantastic Four. There would be NO WAY the Marvel (comics division) would go through with this plan if there wasn't SOME blueprints being formulated at the Marvel (film division). The entire reason Marvel (comics) discontinued F4 and X-Men both were to undercut Fox from further source material, they retconned Quicksilver and Scarlet Witches father, and they tried replacing the X-Men with Inhumans (both comics and live-action). I truly think Kevin Feige does have a blue print (similar to how they handled Civil War and Spider-Mans inclusion) for Avengers 4. I mean come on, its the 4th Avengers, its Phase 4, It'd be PERFECT marketing for Marvel Studios to announce a ""Fantastic Phase 4 "" and at least soft set the Fantastic Four into the canon MCU world. This would take moviegoers eyes of losing RDJ and/or Chris Evans in future films. Not to mention, by Avengers 4 they'll need to have more of a ""rotating door"" of heroes to come on as Avengers, and many of X-Men characters have had Avengers memberships, so I truly do think there is plan, and they wont announce it till right around the time Avengers 4 gets a trailer.

Lets not forget Reed had an infinity stone as a member of the Illuminati. Whether or not the MCU explain the F4 absence within the larger MCU by Reeds tampering of a Stone when he had it (might be a flashback to shortly after Captain America: The First Avenger when Red Skull was last seen using it and theoretically transporting through space). At that point, when Loki will give up the Cosmic Cube to Thanos, its plausible the current timeline's MCU may have never heard of the F4 due to them going right from their cosmic storm origin, into learning about the cube, the infinity stone, and they come through the cube as Thanos pulls the stone from the cube, which technically could be the reason they bring back Red Skull as well.",0.9899,450

Yes their whole shtick is that  they are superhero allegories of marginalized groups but they're still also superheroes. Winter Soldier and presumably Black Panther are very political films that take their subject matters seriously so the whole idea that MCU won't do those themes enough justice is kind of bonkers.

My idea for doesn't conflict with the pre-established themes  of the X-Men. Having mutants re-emerge as a recent phenomenon in the MCU doesn't negate those aforementioned themes.

Over the years, through the events of the MCU, disasters were happening left and right. Professor X offered assistance, but at the risk of their secret getting out. After Infinity War, Professor X will learn that Wanda Maximoff is a Mutant, due to her being able to survive the experimentation she went through. She always had her powers, but to a lesser extent. She was born with the X-Gene, but they were nowhere near as effective before her enhancements. Post credits scene will call the remaining Avengers to the HQ for a briefing. In this, we have our lineup of current Avengers in a hall, waiting for their info to be given, chattering about how they have more important things to do... Until a door opens, and the camera pans from his feet to his head, showing none other than Nick Fury. Behind Nick, rolls out Professor X, and some core members. (Idk who the core members in this new version of X-Men should be) After they are all appearing in front of the Avengers, Fury says, “Here are some... extraordinary people I’d like you to meet.” The camera gives shots of the Avengers’ reactions when the Mutants begin showcasing their abilities. Fury then says, “Whatta you call yourselves? The X- what?” Professor X chuckles and says “X-Men, director.” Fury sarcastically says, “Ohh! X-Men” then walks to the side of the standing Mutants, then looks at the Avengers in front of him. Camera zooms in on X-Men. *Roll credits*",-0.9795,353

They talked about cinamatic universes( Dark Universe, DCEU, Star Trek ) and the difficulties of successfully running a cinamatic universe. I happen to believe the other two are worth doing. The comic book fan in me long ago realized that making a DC live action universe is impossable. The fact that the best stories written by DC comics have wildly differently versions of the same characters making decisions made a connected universe impossible. That was a tangent I explored in my original post. If you can figure out (something no one has ever answered) a way to incorperate great stories from Legion of Superhero's, Justice league, Justice Society, Batman, Superman, Doom Patrol and other great runs of DC comics with different universe versions of the same characters into a cohessive live action universe please do so.

"So I've actually re-watched some trailers, and they don't point out any formula.

The most relevant bit was that most of them were saying something like: ""character evolves from selfish, cowardly asshole to a better person"" - congratulation you've discovered character development.

In fiction the vast, VAST majority of characters change for the better(like most Marvel movies), or they change for the worst, granted there also character that don't change over the duration of the movie, those characters are fully develop and the fun comes from seeing how do they interact with the World around them and other characters (see Winter Soldier for an example). Considering that Marvel makes superhero movies I'd say they choose the right answer.

Also, some of those trailers make jokes which are funny but aren't meant to be taken serious because they don't take into account the finer details like for example:

Compering Tony to Strange: yes, there are similarities when it comes to broad strokes, but if you look closer one is a surgeon that saves lives and the other is a engineer that sells weapons for raining down death onto other people. 

Even the way they change is different: One has a spiritual journey of self discovery due to a car accident,  the other is confronted with the sociopolitical implications of his actions because he was kidnapped by terrorists. One changes by embracing mysticism which is a new concept for him that actually goes against everything he used to know, the other builds a new and improve weapon to escape and decides to manage better his inventions which still include many other weapons, and of course sometimes he fails (see Age of Ultron for that) but that's how life works, you learn a lesson once but that doesn't mean you will be perfect at applying it for the rest of your life.",-0.7056,342

In the original adaptation series two was called ""To Play a King"". In other words, the narrative tension relied on having a conflict with another equally important character. How do you do this in American setting? Answer... Tusk, but that was before he was president.

The third series was then how I assume they'll resolve the Kevin Spacey situation and it's also why I am sceptical that Spacey was actually sacked. Wifey decides the only way to salvage Urqhart's reputation is to have him assassinated. So she had him assassinated.

Also, Underwood was still way too nice by the time the programme got boring. You shouldn't be able to stand watching the character. Instead I was thinking, ""this policy is completely stupid"".",0.1289,203

Gotham just goes a different way. But I agree with them that the shows has quickly lost its original premise, as we kinda have an early stage Batman already and they went into a lot of Batman stories already. So for me its just a different universe where the timing of everything is different, and we will probably see Batman in the show, just a younger version. I like how they show Gotham slowly evolving into the Batman Gotham, with more and  more characters showing up or becoming their alter ego. 
With Metropolis though, I agree too, the whole premise isn't as interesting as Gotham. Gotham was a good basis for a crime show, slowly turning into a Batman Show.

I know Lois & Clark is widely derided by fans of the comics, but the first season is actually kinda awesome -- if you embrace the intention of the show. It’s a romantic comedy with light-hearted crime plots and bucket-loads of camp! What's not to love?! There’s great character work, funny banter and Lex Luthor is even a credible romantic foil to Clark Kent. Sometimes there are delightfully silly villains, other times there are sinister corporate conspiracies. In some ways, Lois & Clark actually revolutionised the depiction of Superman on screen - before Lois & Clark, the Clark Kent persona was portrayed as a goofy disguise. After Deborah Joy LeVine left, the show lost several of its best actors, and the network changed the entire direction of the show. They brought in more stuff from the comics, but only in mediocre, substandard forms. I will concede the show was frequently atrocious by the end of its run.

Those would prob make it feel like they got tacked into the MCU but there is at least things in the Marvel/MCU canon to ""explain"" it.",-0.128,77
blackcobra1981 X-Men can absolutely work in the MCU and it’s not dumb at all. Just  have the X-Gene be a very rare thing in the MCU that only manifests itself  on a few individuals throughout history(which is why you haven’t heard of Mutants in the MCU because they’re so rare they fall under the radar) and after the Thanos invasion the X-gene becomes a lot more prevalent which causes widespread panic and fear across the civilian population of the MCU.,-0.5856,92
"blackcobra1981 actually in  Civil War Vision  mentioned the escalation factor and how there were more serious threats arising as the Avengers had emerged. 

Agents of Shield would have almost no trouble transitioning since there was already an out break of Terigen and Inhumans  popping up, basically their version  of X-Men.  The inhuman emergence has dominated the show ever since and it's part of the same universe supposedly.",-0.872,72
"blackcobra1981 so you combo the reality Stone & time Stone.  Apocalypse was the first mutant, at Fox.  This would not be the Fox timeline simply added to the MCU.  They’d be building it from the ground up.",0.0,45

eh the appeal for me in xmen is not seeing them fight iron man or the avengers....that has been given more importance then it really should in recent years imo but it is what it is......I rather see inferno or xintction agenda on the big screen over some avx nonsense that one side or the other will definitely complain about if there favorites are shafted.....even the reception to the comic was mixed to somewhat negative.,-0.3964,82
how about never. infinity war will be confusing enough with lime 20 heroes. no need to add the crazy amount of mutans their are,0.2373,26

i have seen past season 2 and still think its shit,-0.5574,11
i never thought it about the way Dan Murrel said but right now my belief is that they are working on it right this second they are thinking about how they could fit this in without ruining what has been made before and what could be made but i think a way you could add in Reed Richards and Prof. X by making Tony and T'Challa create the Illuminati.,0.7912,71

"im just gonna point out that Dan was clearly speaking about the DCEU when he was talking about shoving comic book characters into a movie without consideration for their backstories and an overarching story, so anyone saying bringing up DC in the comments is because of some ""bias"" is out of their minds 
I am a DC fan, always have been. This does not make me oblivious to the fact that the DC cinematic universe has been, for the most part, assembled too hastily, and it shows from the box office and the general consensus of the public
Whilst I dont agree with the statement that marvel has better material that is able to be adapted onto the big screen, as a DC fan I refuse to settle for an okay superman movie at best, a batman movie inside a superman movie inside a lois lane detective movie which tried crammed about 7 other movies worth of content into it, a truly awful suicide squad movie, an undeniably great wonder woman movie, and a meh justice league movie
we should be demanding better quality movies, movies that are well structured and thought out, not shot out of the woodwork to try compete with anyone else

that is why DC was brought into this conversation, as an example for what marvel shouldnt do with the x-men",0.9726,241

mcu's got a wealth of sources in those marvel comics..n feige's been immersing himself in it since..he was still a comicbook fankid..? so, as he's honed his movie producing cred, he's been blessed in being given the reign of something that he's known n loved all his life...
while, kennedy's only been the movie producer gal, who's connected as fuck..but not really a fan of or expert in the property she's currently in charge of...",0.9122,104
