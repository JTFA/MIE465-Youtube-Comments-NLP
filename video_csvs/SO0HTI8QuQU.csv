"1. Penis pump does not work
2. Guys with smaller penises aren't really meant to breed
Here is why:
3. Through out evolution every guy had a big penis, it was the race to find the best partner and breed better kids. 
IF a guy bred with the wrong female who has bad chemistry with his genes, usually the kids end up having bad genes.  This is shown on their penis length. If the kid has a bigger penis than their dad then It's sad news because instead of going forward, they went backwards in the race. Though the survival of the fittest already has been won many years ago.  (of course there are many small sized penises). It's good to remember that discriminating someones size is stupid, because both small and big penises have their flaws and benefits.
 
Guys with big dicks:
They can please their partner
They are meant to breed
But they are not in their perfect form.

Guys with small dicks:
This is the indication that they are In their last form (the final form and final stage of the race)
They have tremendous talent -> Some girls say ''they have big egos'' well now they know why, because they are in their alpha form. Big ego is a good thing. 
They aren't meant to breed. If one breeds is because they obviously want kids or a happy family.

This does not apply to females, it doesn't matter if the female has small or big breasts, it doesn't indicate anything. Sure big breasts mean more weight for running for example, but it isn't a huge difference. 

calling out a guy for having a small penis is a compliment, calling out a guy for having a big penis... well that is what makes girls happy so It's a win too. 

Small penises are more of a thing for guys themselves to be happy and bigger penises are more for the girls to be happy.
So if a girl calls your dick small, you don't have to explain yourself. Don't let it get to you and take care of the girl. If it really gets to you, just shake you head.",0.9846,408
