"Dear Friends Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life. He is the only way to eternal life. Did you know that salvation is the gift of Father God's grace? It cannot be gained or made more secure by mere works or deeds, but is freely given to all who put their faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ at Calvary. All who trust the Savior are forgiven of their sins and born into the family of God by the miraculous work of the Holy Spirit. ❤️❤️❤️     (John 1:12; Acts 16:30-33; Romans 10:9-10; Ephesians 1:7; 2:8-9  John 14:6)",0.9709,122
