"As a Canadian this story is great. :)  It's awesome to see sports that are traditionally seen as Western take route in non-traditional markets, therefore expanding the potential the sport has to produce top quality players. Good job Garlic Girls and good luck going forward. Maybe Canada and you will meet in the finals in 2022!",0.9686,61

They are all from the same high school. At first, a girl(Young-mi Kim) started curling as an after school activity and she picked up her friend. One day, when Young-mi's sister came to give her sister something, she was caught and started curling, and she also brought her friend.",0.7506,68

"LetMeSeeThis99 unfortunately, sports in Korea are dominated by self-serving associations that siphon money towards their own pockets that should go towards the athletes or funding for expansion/development. even figure skating was a low-key programme until Yuna Kim won gold in 2010

curling still faces enormous challenges from the lack of funding; after winning their silver medal, the Team Kim athletes each received a total of US$ 30k. the prize money came solely from Fila (their sportswear sponsor). in contrast, one snowboard gold-medalist alone took over 200k

the silver medal won by these girls is actually quite remarkable when you realise that they achieved this feat purely on their own merit and dedication",0.9705,125
