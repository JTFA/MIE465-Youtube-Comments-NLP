I have zero knowledge about baking and cake decorating but whenever I watch your videos, it just inspires me to learn this craft. JJR, I think you and Ashley Holt are the best. You guys have mad skills. I hope to someday learn how to make jaw-dropping cakes like yours. -Ryan",0.964,100

"Hey Josh! I was wondering if it'd be possible for you to do a 100% edible cake?? Like, no bubble tea straws (I know, they're ur fave, lol) and maybe using pretzel sticks or giant candy canes, and then instead of foam bulbs for flowers, maybe malt balls or something instead?? I'm just so intrigued by the idea of literally EVERYTHING being edible! And I think you're the guy who could figure out how to do it. ;3",0.695,94
