"+Drumisfum Don't conflate total views over longer periods of time with big spikes over short invervals indicative of virility.  5 days and 12,000 views doesn't tell us much about the history of it.  Did it gain 11,000 of those views within 30 minutes, or 4 days?  That's what matters.  I said specifically that ""total"" views don't have anything to do with it.  And they never have.",0.5423,76
"+Drumisfum It shouldn't be confusing, this is how trending has always worked.  Whether it had 1,000 views on the first day is pretty much irrelevant, as upload date is not necessarily heavily weighted in the algorithm either.  If it attained 10k views in a short burst, say, on the 2nd or 3rd day, it could just as easily potentially attain trending status especially in concordance with social media and other sites.  

I mean, obviously it hit one of those algorithm markers rather than something magical or mysterious happening =)",0.8579,99

Heh sorry I didn't mean to re open the wound.

"I have actually done both of those things since this video lol. I cut a big hole out of the plastic bottom so I can just slide a pad of paper under the whole thing, and since the pad is soft, it is much quieter. It also now only moves to where there are pixels to be printed so it's much more efficient",0.5849,67
