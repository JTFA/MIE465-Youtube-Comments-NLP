"As a person living with anxiety and depression, this video can truly express how everything is picture inside of my head. I really love this song and the entire album.

"Sure thing! The portrait of the mustache guy is the band's art director, Emy. It's a reference to the ""The Con"" video chapter of The Con: The Movie.
