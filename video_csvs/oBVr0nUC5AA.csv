"Troy, I disagree. The problem with the grammies is that they seem to rely on what's big at the time instead of introducing to people to work that comes from beyond. To me when it comes to metal awards I'd trust certain metal websites for awards instead of them. It kinda makes me wish Brave Words and Bloody Knuckles was still around actually. My parents got me into metal through their mix CDs and it's a shame that it died out before I could be of age to start subscribing.",0.3262,96
True. Hetfield can't really perform that well anymore. Honestly a lot of Hardwired lacked that edge and theatric ability that the first four albums really had going for it. Especially on the solos,0.8578,36

Changing tempo, changing the key signature,  and ""yeh just maybe"" writing different lyrics to already existing songs is not what honest musicians do! The main reason everyone thinks they wrote the songs is because they steal them from bands the mainstream ""Sheeple"" never heard of! They are the biggest posers in the music industry! Trujillo should of stayed with Suicidal!",-0.864,86
William Stanway really aren't that smart are you?,-0.3657,9
"William Stanway, I love Mastodon! However, to say that Metallica doesn't deserve fans because ""their music is flaccid and has not had any musical value since AJFA"" is an utterly ridiculous claim. Yes, St. Anger and LuLu were shit, but even the Load albums had some awesome tracks on them. Sure, they're not complex either, but music doesn't need to be complex to be good.",0.9257,78
"William Stanway, I'm aware that no one mentioned complexity, I was just conceding with some of the ""inb4"" arguments. I've enjoyed the Black Album and Hardwired (despite the radio overplaying Atlas, Rise!), but I will agree that everything in between was underwhelming.",0.501,54
