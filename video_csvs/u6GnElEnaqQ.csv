Before that I was completely obsessed and watched all of your videos at least 4-5 times.. Here I am now, a bit of nostalgia brought me back. But it seems the content is exactly the same as it was a year ago. It seems as though you're kinda ""stuck"" artistically. And may be that's a good thing and you've ""found yourself"" and that's your style. But well... I'll keep checking in again and again, to find if you've evolved in the future :) Have fun, mate",0.5974,135

I love the you and I think alike when it comes to clothes. I went to AE outlet yesterday and got a hoodie and some jeans. My dad gave me a $50 gift card to there for Christmas. That light wash pair of jeans you have I got some just like them and I really love them! Going to start making videos again next month. I might start doing videos like this. Because people love my clothes at times and they ask where i get every thing and I say the gods give them to me. I want to get back into making videos because I miss the views and my fans. Then again most of my fans have me on instagram. Most of your clothes are 80s and 90s looks and you look great in that time look. I really only shop at thrift shops to get my really nice stuff. There is this one place in southern Maine that is called fashion gods and I go there all the time and the manager loves that I go in there with a plan and get things for really good  deals and the stuff is really nice. 4 years ago I got a coat there that's the north face and it was $50. Its the best coat ever! About 85% of my clothes are from thrift shops that are used. Some people think it is weird to get clothes that are used but the stuff I get are in nice shape and there cheap! Love you and please most videos like this.,0.9902,282
