"A long story short: The gymnastics girls liked Doctor Larry NASSAR. Then some lawyers understood big money can be obtained from suing Michigan State University, the United States Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics, and they spoke to the girls. Girls turned around and discovered they had been badly ""raped"" (superfluous medical genitalia touching, often in front of their family). Fortunately MONEY can miraculously heal EVERYTHING, even the guilt of enjoying some shy furtive medical contact. Poor NASSAR is pennyless BUT, taxpayers' pockets are deep. Softporn star Aly RAISMAN jumped on the gravy train. NASSAR‚Äôs role in the theater is over. He is now an irrelevant pawn. From the beginning MONEY is the onlyTARGET.",-0.1779,135

"All 4 of my beloved children were sexually abused at one point in their lives by trusted friends, and relatives. After a lifetime of being sexually abused by various people I wanted to protect my kids. Luckily all 4 of my kids dealt with it healthily. I intervened and contacted the proper authorities immediately when my kids came to me. Unfortunately my two sons did not inform me of the sexual abuse they experienced until just last yr. Theyre adults now but with my oldest is was a step cousin and he doesnt plan at this time to approach her. He still sees her at family get togethers. My youngest was sexually molested by 4 men at different times as she grew up.  The first one that molested her was found guilty and sentenced to 20yrs here in FL to a max security prison. He's still alive, and gets out  5 yrs early, get this, ""for good behavior."". If he has a parole hearing Im going to go to it. This piece of filth had 6 pages of previous pedophile charges all little girls and all dropped due to victims not testifying. I dont blame  them as they were very young. Im so proud of my daughter! I gave her the choice to testify or not against him. She chose to testify, ""So he couldnt hurt anymore little girls."" She was 3 when it happened but 8 by the time it finally came to trial. After many dry runs, and excuses over the course of 5 yrs the sick creep went to trial. My brave 8 yr old got up on the stand and faced him and his lawyer, a judge, and 12 jurors. Her grandpa was the only.one in the gallery there for her. Me and my other kids had to testify so we couldnt be in the rm when she testified. It didnt take more than a few minutes of deliberation and the jury found him guilty of all charges the state had brought up against him. The ADA gave my daughter a hug, held her close, and told her she'd been so brave, and that because she had been so brave he was going to go to prison with a 20yr sentence and he wouldnt be able to hurt anymore little girls ever again!

"Classic victim blaming. Just because a woman ""shows it"" (your words) doesn't mean you have her unspoken consent to sexually abuse her. Just because she has a drink and smiles at you in a bar doesn't mean you have her agreement to being sexually assaulted. Just because she's walking down the street in her winter clothes doesn't mean she silently consents to rape. Just because she's riding the bus at night doesn't mean she's given you her consent for you to rape her. Where do you draw the line? Or do you want it to be like the Middle East where women are covered from head to toe with only their eyes showing because men can't control themselves?¬†

Whenever my kids were in sports, dance, even gym at school.....we discussed what was a no-no.....too bad it was ""AWKWARD"".....it has to be talked about.....you have to explain to your child the minute you start letting them go to even NURSERY school....if you are the type of parent that looks at the time when your child is in the care of others as FREE time....then you need to be aware...and make your child doubly aware.

There‚Äôs no proper way to face any kind of abuse.  Sometimes even with the lack of knowledge of what‚Äôs going on because you get so uncomfortable when you‚Äôre young in that situation we repress what actually is going on and we only remember bits and details.  I hope that it makes more sense to you.  If you really read her face and how she dodges certain questions you can read that she was getting anxiety and she was gonna cry if she continued. She‚Äôs very brave this (seems) early in her process to be talking about it.  It took me 12 years before I could talk about it and I‚Äôm younger than aly.  She‚Äôs a wonderful role model.,-0.6978,247

Seems like your life revolves around gymnastics.So my point it has prepared you for nothing else.So I guess if little girls don't go into this so called sport you won't have a purpose or job.Thats sad I feel bad for you.There are plenty of children that don't start sports early and they do quite well.They don't have their growth stunted or have injuires or get molested by coaches and drs.Have you heard that team USA has a file of over 50 coaches that molested young girls?I guess you don't care because it's all about you and being in front of a crowd .And yes I was an athlete who got recruited by colleges to play but decided to focus on education.So now I have a good job in engineering and I don't have to take my cloths off to do swimwear shoots like a stripper.When ever they interview Aly she keeps saying her body isn't perfect.So all this time spent on a sport and the only thing she can say is she doen't have the perfect body?So what are you teaching these girls about self worth?Go ahead I am waiting for an answer?These is more to life then looks and sixpack abbs.They don't pay the bills and really don't give you self worth.She is not a role model for young girls.She is a sell out.So go on and keep up the fasle front you know I am right.,-0.3114,248

A kid doesn't think along the lines of ""this is wrong and abuse"" when he puts his ungloved fingers inside them as a part of a ""hip and lower back treatment"" because they don't know that's not legitimate, especially if they've never had another doctor. Getting shots is uncomfortable, going to the gyno is uncomfortable so the girls only realized they were being taken advantage of. They hated the treatment sessions but believed it was legitimate and would help them get better.

"This level of gymnastics requires a very strong internal drive to succeed. It cannot come from a parent. The sport is incredibly competitive, remember out of thousands and thousands of young girls, only 5 (soon to be only 4) get a spot at the Olympics every 4 years. A parent can only support a young athletes will and desire, they cannot create it. Mrs. Raisman is certainly no drill sergeant. These parents seem to be experiencing incredible emotional pain, it is all they can do to keep their composure. I feel for the entire family.",0.8712,109

She would do whatever it took to be on  the team.Aly Raisman waited untill she made a large amount of endorsement dollars, and had the Hollywood lifestyle to talk about the sexual Abuses by Larry Nasser. I only saw one video online from Aly Raisman that mentioned that abusive coaches went from gym to gym, as a cover up . I never heard Aly talk about the Karoli's part in these criminal acts. Martha and Bella Karoli obviously covered up the Larry Nasser sexual abuses. Bella did some horrible things to young girls, that were not publicized by Aly Raisman. Martha, although, not criminal, burned out these girls with multiple training sessions at the Texas Ranch. Mckayla Maroney on her Gymcastic interview even said "" The team trained for 30 straight days before leaving for the London Olympics."" I feel that Aly Raisman said nothing about Martha and Bella Karoli, because Martha was an integral part in reaching her dream of competing in the Olympic Games!!!",-0.9017,217

And I have met so many ex athletes who say that this sport destroyed their knees or shoulders. But who cares right they are just kids they don't count right.Adults know best,0.178,96
