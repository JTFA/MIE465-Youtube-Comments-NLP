"Dear society,

  I am a foster child, Yes I don’t have a mom or a dad, Yes I make mistakes, Yes I don’t have food very often, Yes I don’t have very much people that care about me, Yes I get beat up, abused, and neglected..... but the things that I’m going through just makes me more stronger! Day by Day I tell myself that I shouldn’t go through any of this horrible, cruel, mean, hurtful, and awful stuff but,  each day that goes by.... I’m still alive and breathing! And yes I have cuts, bruises, scratches, scares and many other hurtful openings on my body... but I’m ALIVE and that’s all that matters! All of us have been through something horrible in our life’s but there is always someone way worse out there than you. Let me tell you a little about me... 

    I have been in foster care basically my whole life. It all started out with my mom and father that I never knew. They weren’t on good terms at times but that’s how every relationship works. My mom always had food in the house, water running, Clothing for me and my siblings, shelter, and most of all LOVE and RESPECT for each and everyone of us. She NEVER gave up on trying to keep us all alive and healthy! But then at age 5 she lost me and I went into foster care. Day by day and Sibling by sibling got removed from our home. All of my other siblings got adopted and I was remained in foster care. At such a young age I started to act out and  become uncontrollable. I was Put into many different residential treatments, foster care families, Behavioral hospitals, Group Homes, and many different other Places to help me. That went on for years and years.... I was locked into trunks, basements, closets, rooms for several days without no food or water.  I was then found by the police and removed from the foster home. Currently while the state is trying to find me another foster home for me to live in... I’m in the Group Home getting beat up from head to toe. NOTHING reported at this moment. It continues... now I’m back into another foster home trying to figure things out, wondering if they are gonna be nice or not, have food, and most of all if I can trust them. A couple of months go by and I’m found on the streets homeless and anorexic. I’m back in the ER again. I’m there for a while... I’m scared and lost. Now I’m released and put on 15 different medications a day to stabilize my moods. Nothing is working... a couple of years go by and I’m finally in school for the first time. I made a couple of friends that I call family! I thought my life was going back to normal and things were gonna be great.... Then I gotta call from my caseworker and she told me my birth mom and dad had passed away. I completely shut down and lost it for years... being in and outta jail aka DT, fighting others my age, getting kicked out of schools, stealing cars, robbing stores, destroying others belongings and property, and on and on and on. I cried day and night non stop. My mom is my best friend and we have always had a special bond! I still didn’t have my crap together but I was trying my VERY hardest to. I was so emotionally hurt and lost that I just needed to find my way back to my mom.... I didn’t believe that she was gone. But EveryTime I tried to find my way back... I was hit, kicked, punched, cut, molested, raped and beat to death. I didn’t deserve any of that stuff. And neither did any other child. I was a good child but ever since my mom lost me... I have never been the same. 

  To this day I still have things like this happening to me and just wish it would all stop. I have no friends. I can’t really trust anybody. But I am almost an adult! I am graduated from High School! I have succeeded in many things! I’m not here to tell you how horrible my life has been or that I’m a bad person... I’m here to tell you that your not alone! Your strong and beautiful in your own way! And NEVER let anyone tell you differently cuz it’s true!!! 

  I am sorry for my bad attitude that I give People!!! And I do gotta mouth! But I’m really not doing it to be rude or hurt you! It’s because I’m having a bad day... and everybody has one of those days!! My life is not Perfect. I mean you can take a look at me and think that I’m so happy all of the time or think that my life is so awesome and full of fun... when really I’m going through hell at that Point,  Fighting back tears and Putting on a smile even though it’s not real. And I still am. I am just trying to show you that I’m strong not weak! I don’t have a late curfew or have my license or a car like most teens my age do! No joke I’m stuck in my room all day! But I am grateful to be because I have time to myself to figure out things. And I enjoy the peace and quiet! But to be honest with you it gets boring after a while. And sometimes I just want to get out of the house and hang out with someone! And most times that doesn’t even happen. But that’s OK! I’m just grateful for each and every day I get to spend alive and healthy! I may not have all of the qualities and special things that most teenagers do! But I am unique and I know I can work towards anything if I put my mind to it! 

   I just want you all to know to never give up and keep trying no matter how hard things get! #AlwaysBelieveInYourself 💙 I hope you see this Ellen and I’m going to be posting this on every 2018 video you make! I’m trying to get this inspiration and my story out there!

    XoXo,
