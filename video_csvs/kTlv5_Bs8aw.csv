I'm not really a kpop fan, my younger sister forced me to watch BTS and Black pink (even though i love punkrock) but i gotta say that BTS are freaking creative with their dance choreography and music videos . A big applause to the members and staff crews . So far i think ""save me"" is the most catchy and best choreography (for me) . Even though i do'nt listen to kpop much, i wish this genre very best of luck . Btw i only saw ""blood, sweat and tears"", ""DNA"", ""save me"" and this ""mic drop"" video so recommend me something good . Thanks !",0.9935,138

"Juju Superstar dont worry your not dumb, at first when i discoverd kpop i didnt know even what stream means😅 it is very important to watch the video until the very end so the view will count. Also you can do a streaming list: i personaly put in my list all the mv's that are about to hit 100m/200m/300m views, on reapet. Right now i stream save me, dope, micdrop and boy in love, and when the mv get to his goal i change it to anther. You can chack my stream playlist on my account!",0.9312,111
"Juju Superstar i have another streaming tip that i use a lot that will make you stream it for 11 times, here are the steps:
View 1- watching the mv as usual
View 2 - watch it with subtitels
Views 3-10- focus on one member for every view
View 11- scroll down the comments while listening 
View 12- watch the mv again😂
Hope it will help you! :)",0.8356,75

BTS has been #1 for many weeks beating global singers like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande... it's funny that you think that your local kpopie groups are a threat for BTS. lmao 😂😂😂..  the funniest thing is that BTS hasn't been so active since last year but they still managed to stay at #1 all this time, while your local kpopie groups are just charting because they're releasing new music now. Let's see if these local kpopie groups can stay in the Social chart after they end their promotions?!! btw, BTS are kings who are paving the way!! and remember that if these groups get a Billboard nomination, I'll scream in your faces that BTS PAVED THE WAY!!!",0.7341,202
