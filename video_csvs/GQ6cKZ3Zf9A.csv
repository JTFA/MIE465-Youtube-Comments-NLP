"Congrats to you both for working together as a team and being able to sensibly sit down and make a plan together and work on it together.  You are an ideal couple who should write a book or go around telling and teaching your story doing seminars.  So many need to hear it!!!  It would save marriages, homes, lives and honestly I think even children would be happier.  There is nothing but garbage out there for kids to watch.  They need to be outdoors and learn about nature and how to survive in it...actually everyone needs to learn it.  Because one day, we will need to know it and wish we had learned more.  I'm prepared, but old now and it would be difficult for me to survive on my own.  But a fighter in every way, so I will be fine.  You can be very, very proud of what you have accomplished.  You could actually make a bunk bed that lowered from the ceiling in your daughter's bedroom.  Do an ""L-shape"" putting your son's small bed above the foot of her bed.  Raise and lower it each night.  He can crawl in and out via the bottom of her mattress, but also have a small ladder for him to climb up too that hooks on to his bed.  I visualized that and I feel sure it's feasible, with little cost and work.  Just ensure safety and strength to hold his weight as he grows. Blessings to your family.  L :)",0.993,282

I love their story. What was the total cost of this tiny house?,0.6369,15
"I love these shows but they often omit the cost of land they live on.   Land is very expensive now, which 99% need a mortgage for.   Stopping on relatives or friends is not a long term option.    IN addition, the capital gains you make in 10 years owning a house, is more then you will ever save in your entire lifetime, sadly.

"I recently saw that the gov't is coming down on these tiny houses.  It threatens their control over the people they want to keep in debt and reliant on the system, stuck in controlled cities.  I'm praying that more and more people will embrace this lifestyle.  In an emergency, these people will be able to feed their children. They are also teaching them life skills, which our school system is massively lacking.  I have never seen a more dumbed down inept generation than today.  Bravo to this couple!!!",-0.3526,100

I wish these kinds of videos would include income amount more.,0.4019,12
"I'm glad they acknowledged that tiny houses are inaccessible to a lot of people due to cost or labor involved, and that it's really hard to build one yourself. People in the tiny house community can sometimes idealize the lifestyle and make it seem like anyone could do it if they just wanted it bad enough.",0.3626,59
"I'm really curious as to which province (and general part of the province) this tiny house is in? As a Canadian I'm super keen on building a tiny house, but laws seem to differ depending on where it's parked!",0.6472,44
"I'm scepticle too, because to pay of such a high dept in 20 month, you need to have a really huge income. I'm not from the US, so I dunno exact figures how much you'd have to earn there, but for Germany it'd be about 8-10k a month  (as a couple) to be able to pay of $4.800 every month. I have a good job, but even if a could spend my whole wage for 2 years without having to pay taxes, rent or food, I'd just make it to the 96k.

Sadly this goes for many of these stories. You never really get to see everything behind the curtain. It always is shown like ""everyone can do it"", but it should be ""everyone with a 6 figure wage can do it"".",0.4208,154
"If I'm $6,000 in debt and only make $15,000 a year- take a wild guess how long that might take to pay off. When you don't spend money to begin with, it is also difficult to tighten one's belt so to speak as well.",-0.5106,50
"If they can put aside 96,000 USD in 20 months that means they must have a good income together. Plus probably at least one of them has a good healthcare plan provided by the employer or that would eat into the budget big time. And maybe the possibility to give up at least one car and drive to work with a bike or public transportation.

Still - well done. But if people need to live in the city where their job is and they need to spend a lot on their rent, they often get trapped. (and once you are in the trap it has hard to gain the wriggle  room to move around and improve your situation). 

For instance homeless persons in New York.  A couple and 1 kid, they have not lost control over their life (addiction etc) - they are working (and found a place in a shelter - at least that).

It is just that childcare and rent was so high that they were priced out even of a modest existence.

Sure they could move to a region where the costs of living are not as high. But if you have no relatives, savings (or credit line !) to fall on - moving initially will cost you additional money. (It could even make sense to increase your debt a little bit to move, rearrange your situation and then start paying back, but you must be able to make the first move). 
Often it is hard to arrange matters from the distance (travelling to go for a job and seek a place to stay costs money AND time). 
usually it is easier to move to a region, live off your savings for a little bit, try to find a place to stay and then apply for a job as soon as you have settled in. That might take you 2 - 4 weeks.

also I would not underestimate the social pressure for children in school to have certain clothes and gadgets and whatnot. (Of course they could circumvent that with homeschooling if one of the parents stays at home).

 It is not necessessarily that children are so demanding or their parents so ambitious. There is a lot of SHAME attached to dressing unfashionable (or for the parents to not provide the right clothes for their children) - these days dressing ""well"" means ripped jeans (if they come from the ""right"" = expensive brand).",0.8659,454

"This is not only a great Tiny House but it's also a great message to us all about the real reason we're here on this planet. For sure we're here to procreate and sustain the human race however we are not here to live/survive for the duration while in debt to others.

Without getting too political, the Establishment like the idea that young people saddle themselves with debt because ultimately that leads to a passive, pliable even docile population that never challenges the reasons why so much debt is owed to so few ? Half of the world's wealth is owned by 1% of the population. Maybe we should start thinking about changing that ?

They were both built in 1938, when no such law existed. I can not understand their reasoning, aside to make more money with more one house only large lots.

"You guys have come such a long way with the quality of your content, it's been such a pleasure watching it grow and gain this following! Great work, thank you for inspiring me all the time! As a Canadian myself, I am very curious to know which province the Burgess family is living in? I find it hard to come across areas where you can compost human waste, etc. without strict regulation. Very curious.",0.9588,84
Your place is so beautiful. What about building a room like a 14 x10. In back or to the side with just a little connecting hall. And that room could be split into 2 private rooms for the kids. Maybe when your on your own land you will have a perfect spot for that. We have a similar set up. I love the hill side garden. I would like to do that. Actually the little play house connected to your home would be perfect for an extra bedroom. I agree with you. I want our girls to live tiny as well. And we have enough land for that to be possible. With plenty of space between us. Thank you for sharing.,0.986,135

"kledder, actually, being an RN on night shift and the type of hospital/ setting she works in, being part time you can pull in a lot of money. I am an RRT, and worked nights and the shift differential and weekend night differential can really add up. They never said she didn't pick up extra hours here and there. I was part time but picked up more than full time hours regularly and could easily pull over $2000 take home pay in 2 weeks, and with my pay in my area, ( we generally make slightly less than RN's) of $30/hr she alone could have put up almost $4800 a month, at times. So it is possible. Being paid hourly gives you more freedom to increase your pay than salary,  obviously. :)",0.9244,153

"love the tiny house if you can call it that, its huge. The problem i have is when they said at 10:26 that they won't be living in that house forever. Why build such a huge tiny house without future proofing it. I mean yeah you would've made it a little narrower in some aspect. I feel that this place could have 2 lofts and 1 bedroom which would be perfect for a family of 4. The idea of tiny house living is 1 to have less, 2 to be more free and 3 to enjoy more of outdoors instead of being in the house all the time. tiny houses are beautiful because there's less.",0.9709,124

"recently realized that vegetarian meals are healthy and important for your life and you can't survive without eating vegetables , and actually meat was totally unnecessary to add to the diet . I stopped all meat and good riddance to eating meat . I feel much better and comfortable eating vegetables . Meat eating is a real curse on the society and does not benefit at all .",0.6927,68

"so fancy, great accomplishment, also very traditional family, man builds house, woman takes care of child and voice of reason.. you can pop up some sheds and they only cost about 7,000.  Check it out... don't have to be soooooooooooooo fancy with so much wood etc, think about the pop up, the off grid make shift...  Sheds are great because you can put a simple structure  that you can use a studio, office and or a bedroom",0.9179,88
"there's still room to grow in this house - they could build a second loft for the daughter in a couple of years, and the younger child could keep the downstairs room. i love how nice and natural and honest this couple is, it's my second time watching this video and it might not be the last one. thank you for bringing this video to us ! :)",0.9558,72
