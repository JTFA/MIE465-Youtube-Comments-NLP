"First of all I really liked the video but there's one point I disagree with and that's fine. I just want to say that it's no ""necessary"" that you love yourself before you love a different person. For people dealing with depression that can be very scaring and you could think that as long as you're fighting depression, you're not able to be in a relationship. But that's not true maybe being in a relationship can even help you. I now some people who have struggles with depression but still are in a relationship. Sometimes it can be nice to have someone to lean on and sometimes it can be easier to love someone else than yourself and to be loved. Just wanted to say that",0.6439,135

Personally I like her and her videos a lot and that‚Äôs why I am commenting on this because I don‚Äôt want here to start putting crazy effects and random unnecessary stuff on her videos or I won‚Äôt be able to watch them anymore.

"If a person refuses to relate to someone because he is depressed then the person is despising the other and when the other man heals from depression and finally being able to relate will not be with that person he despised.
Sounds like wrong advice, love is not something that just happens because someone says, love is built with interaction and time. The same person who despises those who have the mental illness of depression is a person who thinks it is okay to be left behind because of depression and this sounds scornful because contempt does not help depressed people and most people with depression are not so for lack of self-love but by traumatic and difficult factors that do not involve relationships but the chemistry of the mind.",-0.9751,135

"opinion: To love another person before loving oneself implies having the other as an emotional crutch, addiction.
If you love yourself before you love the other person, you will not have to feel as if the other is used as an emotional crutch, and in case the relationship ends, there would be no loss of someone who used to fill the void of love for yourself.
In other words, you love others in the lack of love that your own defines as a puppet of other people when your happy is controlled by external love.
If I change to the other and the other ends a relationship, my change loses meaning = the dependence of the other being with you to change to make sense = arbitrary.
If I change to me without dependence of other in which the other can only have at least one influence on their change in the form help or motivational will = I do not depend on the other and in case I end a relationship my change Still it still makes sense because I did not change for the person, but for me = Wisdom.
Change for me to better influence a successful relationship than to change for the other. Switching to the other means depending on the other for a change have a significance. There is a difference between changing self or changing depending other person. 
Of course there are exceptions, the person who does not love himself yet but first loves the other can in a relationship learn to love himself even though he first loved the other with a dangerous risk of having emotional dependence.
Obviously, a person can be bad and use the excuse of love to justify attitudes that basically just happened to hate and cause guilty, hatred means wanting to see the death or pain of the other. Love disguised as hate is rare. (traps are hate or gay)
