"""So shouldn't they be rewarded for their years of work?""

I'm sorry, I didn't get the rationale behind rewarding a company for extorting the poor. The premise of patent law is two-fold: to protect the invention; and to incentivise innovation. Commercial extortion was never the intent of any patent jurisprudence, which is why most nations have the concept of compulsory licensing after a certain number of years (in India, it's 3 years) to ensure that innovations are accessible to all, without any exploitation or discrimination. In any case, patents are fine for inventions, not discovery of the fact gene that could probably lead to breast cancer. In this case, the patent was wrongfully granted. No natural gene can be patented for the simple reason that the human body operates out of the confines of patent law. We can only discover facts about our body, not invent anything, unless we're inventing a new gene altogether.",0.6454,177

There is a general balance of give and take (The USA is not really close to a pure capitalistic country in reality). My perfect system would be a hybrid between the two.

Also, i don't think the question is whether it is ethical not to allow for patented human gene editing; this video claims that having patents will give researchers a reason to study gene editing, but you can have gene editing that is not dependant of private bussinesses. Wouldn't it be more ethical to have the government provide gene editing, especially since they are doing so for a nation's citizens? in fact, the government would have an incentive other than patents, for they could use gene editing (at least, the promise of providing it) as part of their political campaign.",0.9325,180
"I think there are two false assumptions behind the notion that companies are entitled to some kind of exclusivity for the advancements they bring:
1. The main incentive for discovery is monetary gain
2. We owe the discovery to these specific people and no one else

People invent stuff for various reasons. Laziness, curiosity, vision... SpaceX barely generates any profit, because Musk prefers to stay 100% in charge and apparently has a vision (whether he turns out to be a Batman or a Bond villain or anything in between :).

Research also doesn't take place in vacuum. A dozen competing companies may have already tried tempting approaches that proved to be wrong, paving your way at their own expenses. And hey, maybe a year or two later a competitor would have released the same tech as open source. Which is more beneficial for the society and more worthy of support?

You already have the head start when you come up with something new. The ease of establishing exclusivity actually decreases the incentive to keep researching and stay on top. All you need to do is to license and lawyer-stomp anyone who tries going around your stranglehold. One famous example would be James Watt's engine.
Why not just leave the exclusivity and secrecy to everyone's abilities? Some products are inherently easier to imitate or reproduce than others, and no amount of legal safeguards will change that. Black market is always there to supply illegal knockoffs, and you lose on taxes on top.
Stone sculptures are simply harder to copy than comic book pages and it's similar with technologies. Sometimes final product tells you everything you need to know, other times the technological process or source code is necessary. Some areas are inherently more predatory than others.

Concerning Monsanto, the idea that they offer a product that is ""superior"" in some way is wonderful, they can and should be compensated for it. But... the problem is the seeds and the nature of seeds.
Seeds spread by wind, wash out, etc. Seeds grow. Genes may or may not be spread through pollen movement, etc. And this is an enormous problem. By their very nature these genetic modifications can and will spread.

This raises the possibility that a creator of genetically modified organisms could sue (though this supposedly has not happened yet) an unwitting patent infringer, resulting in significant financial and livelihood harm to that party.

Yes, companies and students ought be compensated for their research and discovery, however, firstly, that should not be at the expense of depriving those people (up to all of mankind) who would benefit the most from their contributions, and secondly, it should not be at the expense of depriving others from further innovation. For these reasons I believe that research and development ought to be subsidized through the Department of Education under a new Office of STEM Research fund. This office would oversee leading technology and breakthroughs (like BRCA-1,  or GMOs that at vitamin dense, etc) and  pay for that research based on man hours spent and capital procured.

Iif we are being pie in the sky, the new Office of STEM Research should also be an open forum where test results, data, and observations would be shared in real time, allowing others to reduce duplicative efforts on the same topic and instead promote synergistic development.",0.7906,188

"Problem with genetically modified anything is you can't control nature. Those genes can get out and ruin people's business. There were already cases where farms growing non-gmo crops which had neighbors growing gmo crops and some of those gmo crops got on their land and Monsanto sued them and won.

One case was a farmer who had some wild canola growing on this land near the road and it didn't die when he sprayed the area with round up to keep the other weeds in the area. Since Monsanto had told the farms they were looking to improve their round up product they wanted to be alerted to any plants that didn't die. So he contacted them and some Monsanto guys came out to take samples. Few months later he gets slapped with a law suit for growing Monsanto patient canola on his property without a license. It went to court and they ruled in favor of Monsanto saying it didn't matter how the plants got their the farmer had infringed on their patent. And this wasn't the only case.

So much of the crops are GMO because of these kind of tactics where even if the farmer wins they lose because the legal fees bankrupt the farm. So their only choice is to use the GMO crops. Regardless of what you think about the safety of GMO crops this kind of behavior is the very reason that it was originally intended that you can't patient life.

These plants get carried by the wind, birds, rivers, and so on. They can cross breed with other plants once released into the wild. How do you determine where the original patiented GMO ends and a naturally formed cross breed begins? With the Salmon fish if they get in the wild do you now have GMO companies suing fisherman for ""stealing"" their property when they catch fish in the wild?

I don't buy the BS excuse that this research woudln't get done with companies couldn't strangle hold their discoveries and hold them to ransom. In fact I think it is the oppisite. Remember the days when medicne use to cue major disease? They cued small pox, whopping cough, and etc and did the vaccinations in droves. No a days companies like that breast cancer group sue the competition for infringing on their patient (yeah i heard about that when a competing lab trying researching on the same gene) and companies make drugs that ""treat"" illnesses and you have to keep taking them for years if not for life. After all it's better to have life long customers than one time patients.

The world hasn't gotten better because of these companies gouging the public with their strong arm tactics, it's gotten better inspite of it as countries with more lax regulations allow their citizens access to more affordable generic brands of the same drugs which then poor working people have to smuggle into the country just so they can live. Any company that makes it's money off the suffering of others is evil by very definition. It would be one thing if the cost of making that medication was just to high but it is not they inflate the price to make fortune knowing people will go without and suffer.",0.8251,583

"The thing is, nobody would ever want his child/loved one to suffer a disease. You don't consider the idea of choosing if the baby will have alzheimer or not. You will unquestionably want the kid to be fine. If we allow companies to patent and charge for gene modifications that solve those kind of issues (wich in many cases are life changing or even live saving), we're granting them the right to exploit our need for a cure for diseases that would otherwise be incurable and in many cases, fatal. It is not the same to charge for a genetic modification that will end headaches (just to put an easy example, I don't know if that has anything to do with genetics), something that will go away eventually, than to charge for a genetic mutation that will cure, let's say, ALS, wich stays with you until it kills you. Is it ethical to put a price (wich is essentially an entry level) to the cure for a deadly disease that was previously incurable, that will change millions of lives? Would anybody want to live in a world where someone could have been prevented from having, and probably dying of, leuchemia but nothing was done about it because there wasn't enough money on the table? In many cases, putting a price to these types of genetic modifications means putting a price to human lives, and is and will forever be, unethical.",-0.644,271

"There's a misunderstanding here of how intellectual property works in plants.  IP in plants includes plant patents, plant variety protection (PVP) and utility patents.  Plant patents are specifically for asexually propagated crops.  PVP is a weaker form of IP that still allows replanting and breeding rights.  In the modern era, this covers most crops.  Utility patents have been a recent phenomenon applied to crops, and companies make use of this because it's stronger than PVP.  When utility patents are applied to GM crops, there are utility patents on the GM trait, but also a separate patent on the genetics.  One thing I think wasn't made clear in the video: you can still apply a utility patent to a non-GMO variety/hybrid.  The GM trait is largely an independent patent.",-0.3971,147

An invention needs to be novel (not in the prior art), non-obvious to someone skilled in the art and useful in order to be patented. Something that already exists is not novel.

Similarly the sequence of a gene cannot be patented because it already exists and is therefore not novel.

"You completely get the question at the end wrong. Genes are not 100% predictors for disease. Yes, there are genes that are precursors to disease. But that does not make that disease destiny. Further, there are SO MANY diseases and corresponding predictor genes, that it isn’t worth it to change very many of them. Making so many cuts in a human is a recipe for splicing the wrong thing and screwing something important up. No, the real place where gene editing becomes massively popular is in superficial stuff. Because who on earth wants to have a child who they know will go through life looking less intelligent than their peers? What parent would willingly let their child have a skin tone that they know would make it harder to eventually find a spouse? What parent would turn down the option to give their child the kind of skin that makes them less likely to be shot by a cop, or thrown in jail, or denied a job?
