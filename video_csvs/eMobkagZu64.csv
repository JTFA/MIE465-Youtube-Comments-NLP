1. We don't know how well CP would convert into a level-based system. We can't restart it, since people will lose work, and we can't scale it because people will already have maxed level Pok√©mon without even battling.
2. What happens to Pok√©mon candies? They wouldn't be used for leveling up; we have Rare Candy for that.
3. Battling to level up seems like a bad idea. What happens if I have no friends to battle with? How would I get rewarded for battles?",-0.7536,112

That's the point of this video. It's supposed to be presented in an Animal Planet documentary style.,0.0,19
The game is becoming pointless with no way to trade or have pvp.. there's no point in catching Pokemon if there is nothing to do with them yet besides lame gym battles. Be rid of the gym battles pvp and trading will be your biggest feature ever! The gyms should be there to beat leaders not bots. Pokemon isn't truly pokemon without trading and pvp that's what it's all about. Fake Promises and  major fails is all niantic has given us.. make something worth while for once please!!,-0.9298,96
The game sucks but this ad is amazing.,0.6652,9
"The iPhone 4S came out almost 7 years ago. Apps that do still support it are slow and unoptimized for it, and many new apps don't work with it at all. Niantic is most likely going to phase out iOS 9 support, so eventually, Pok√©mon GO won't work with your device anyways. If you really like your 4S, your best option for a new phone would be the iPhone SE, which is $349 unlocked. Hope I helped!",0.9391,88
"The narrator's voice doesn't sound that good. It felt like an travel commercial, like for one of those airlines about visiting places. 

Instead, there should be more ""fun"" in the voice, rather than this animal documentary style voice.",0.3806,46
The only way pokemon go will be saved is if they add battling and trading. Those were the staple mechanics that made pokemon a hit. But instead they are focused on the catching but without battling this app is pointless.,-0.128,43
