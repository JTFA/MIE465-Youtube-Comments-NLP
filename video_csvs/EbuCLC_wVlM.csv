"Tamara Pacheco Beauty is ultimately subjective - beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That said, a beauty standard based on sexual attraction/evolution is likely to be more genuine than one made more arbitrarily. A hetero woman judging another woman's beauty is in the second category and IMO is arbitrary or at least socially conditioned. 

It's just something I've always noticed - there are certain ""beauty types"" - typically a ""generic"" type of beauty that I see a lot of women fawn over and gush about. I've never found those beauty types attractive and it's interesting that it's a judgment that doesn't stem from sexual attraction.",0.9893,119
