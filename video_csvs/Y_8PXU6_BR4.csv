"Hells: Luke NEVER came out. If you want to talk about some magazine article where he implied he's gay as coming out, than that's your choice. To me, coming out is saying the words, ""I am gay"" or ""I'm in a relationship with someone of my same-sex"" For Luke, someone mentioned he was gay, and he never confirmed or denied. That's not coming out.",0.4031,78
"Hells: you're an idiot. Do you even know what coming out means? For the record, this is the interview where Luke ""mentioned"" his orientation"" in 2014 about being a gay actor playing action-hero roles, Luke replied: “It’s good for people to look at me and think this guy is doing his thing and enjoying what he’s doing and successful at it and living his life. And that’s what I’m doing and I’m very happy.” THAT'S NOT COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET! Coming out, is saying, ""I am gay"" or ""I have a boyfriend"" you are a liar. People like you love Luke because he rides the fence. He pretends to be ""openly gay"" without having to ever mention it on live video, or live tape.

He's trying to have it both ways where he can be ""openly gay"" while not discussing his sexual orientation, which would make him partially closeted. It's all right.

"Natalie Zayas-Bazan yeah, you're right. You make a good point. Atleast you're honest. Luke Evans is hot as hell, and there's more straight women then there are gay men in the world. So, Luke is appealing to them that's why he's keeping his sexuality on the down low.",0.4391,56
"Natalie Zayas-Bazan yesss! you're exactly right. And Luke is sooo HOT! I saw those shirtless pics lol. I know fan girls love Luke too because I see their comments.

I'm sure homophobes love you.",0.1779,78

"Will there ever be a hollywood movie about a Russian that isn't in the kgb, mafia, or just somehow connected to violence? How about a hard working, honest Russian family man named Kostja who's just trying to provide for his family, and his wife Sveta is growing distant from him because he drinks too much, so she basks in the attention of their neighbor Sergey. One day, when Kosja is away Sergey invites himself over and plays with the kids and Sveta starts having dark thoughts. When the kids are busy watching tv, Sergey helps Sveta clean the dishes and she confronts him, saying ""You know, I like the attention you give me and the kids, so much so it sickens me."" And he replies, ""It sickens me too, but I can't help it. I'm in love."" In walks Kostja, drunk as a skunk, and he immediately figures out what's going on. He says, ""I knew you liked us way too much, but you made them happy when I couldn't. I can't even accuse you."" They all talk things over. Kostja still works like a dog but he stops drinking and spends more time with the family. Svetlana once again falls in love with him and does her best to support him. The end.",0.9703,249
