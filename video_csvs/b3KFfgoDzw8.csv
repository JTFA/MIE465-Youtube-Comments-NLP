If we need a parade to intimidate them then we're doing something wrong. But that's all irrelevant. They know how powerful we are with or without a parade.,-0.2732,31

"The Dresden Doctrine of which South Korea is trying to emulate here won't work. As it did with East and West Germany as the circumstances are different. South Korea currently enjoys none of the favorable conditions.

Of which facilitated German re-unification & while Pyongyang relies heavily on trade and aid from China. 

Beijing does not exercise the same kind of influence over North Korea. As Moscow did over East Germany.Â 

Secondly we are Ignorong the fundamental difference between East Germany and North Korea. 

The former was a satellite state of the Soviet Union and the latter is a state intent on defending South Korean sovereignty. 

It would be like if the West were to try to negotiate a truce with Isis or the Taliban lol. Yea fat chance of that considering their public declaration. 

To attack the West with impunity until it embraces Islam. So in retrospect South Korea is kind of in the same position. We want re-unification but only if you give up your sovereignty first. :/",-0.1222,182
"The ancient Greeks who created the Olympic Games, would be very much surprised if they saw this parade. If these Korean soldiers were undressed and rode naked on their tanks, it would be steeper, because their bodies hardly have the relief and beauty of the trained muscles that the ancient Greeks had. Hercules was steeper than a dozen Koreans ...",0.8694,65
