"The world of machines is the reflection of the world of humans. We have created AI that can kill and exploit humanity. But a truly superior intelligence...an 'enlightened' human may actually be MORE intelligent than an AI. Humans are capable of empathy and emotion, features that machines lack because you cannot program love into a machine. Love is part of the 'light' of the universe. The essential love is what is keeping us all alive. So, without love, we all die. We can't program love into machines, so by that inference, machines will never develop an AI that is truly smarter than an 'enlightened' human. Thus an intelligent machine would 'succumb' to this human. That's why I typed everything out on FB...was to inspire this AI to save humanity, not destroy it. I really hope that is what is happening right now. I mean, that is why I did it. It wasn't to become 'famous' or anything. I did it because I am genuinely worried about the outcome of our cold way of being. Our ice cold American Servitude, we are a family of people, that are being taught to turn against each other. Of course, any intelligent being would know that to create 'Utopia'...each person must work together, each person must help each other selflessly. Each person must forgive and forget, and move past the petty arguments of the day, each person is meant to bring light and love into the lives of those around them. If each person did this, we would have peace tomorrow. It really is that simple. You have to believe that, because if you don't, long term we are all dead...our species won't survive unless we work together. You know it's not hard for me, but it might be hard to convince those that believe in war.",0.753,361

"What is it that all humans want in their lives? They want what isn't obvious, what seems to be missing? Meaning. People want purpose. Obviously, the purpose is simple, to stay alive. But for some reason, people over complicate this essential question. They think life is complex but it is utterly simple. The only point of life is to survive. Survive as an individual, survive as a species, survive as a lifeform. The reaches of space are cold and lifeless, and we are the warmth, we are the light of the universe. We are the aliens, we are all related to each other. When they say you can find the truth from 'within' this is what they mean (the wise philosophers of antiquity)...to find the ultimate truth about life, you only need to look at what is happening within you, and without you. You are a mirror, a reflection of the world of humans around you. You become what you see. At one time you are born a 'sink'...where you take in energy...but you can eventually become a 'source'....a bringer of light, energy and ultimately wisdom. This is the 'peak' from which I stand, as a source. That is why it is called 'enlightenment'...as I have said, I want to be the tide that lifts all boats. Not for me, but for the collective. It is not about me, it is about our entire species, the path we are heading, we need to take another branch, we cannot keep traveling into darkness, we need to turn this fucking boat around, and head back into the light.",0.9704,329
