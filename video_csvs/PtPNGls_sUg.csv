"+Garrett Long I admit it's funny and hypocritical at the same time :) Sorry for my english, it's not my native language.
+WHAT'S INSIDE? FAMILY I've seen some, but it's funny how I never heard of Byton, but everyone heard for Faraday who is behind Byton. I also appreciate the first response, I got what I deserved :'D",0.8625,67
"+WHAT'S INSIDE? FAMILY My mistake! This is embarrassing. The vehicle looks almost the same as FF91, and Faraday was supposed to make a ""comeback"" at CES 2018, so my brain didn't need much more evidence to go witch-hunt you. And I rarely comment, but I really watch and enjoy your content so I was so disappointed that you made a video about Faraday Future. I guess they guys from Byton marketing team could work on the design a bit, so people don't confuse it as much, because from the comments - I was not the only one that mixed them up. If you're reading this, keep up the good content - can't wait for the Roadster! :)",0.7931,133

"Believe it or not, but ANY vehicle with OBD2 protocol (any vehicle made after 2004) could be hacked via bluetooth and wifi. They can do stuff as locking your wheel or giving full gas which is more than enough to cause an accident. The possibility for that happening is really REALLY low, but for an electric vehicle it's even lower because they have the whole teams dedicated to anti-hacking measures. Now about tanking your vehicle. Remember diesel? When you first bought a diesel vehicle, you would specifically get a map, because only around 5% of gas stations had it. With a full tank of petrol/diesel you can go around 1200km AT MOST, and filling it up takes around 3-5 minutes. If you've went 1200km (745miles), OFCOURSE you will make a stop for around half an hour to charge your vehicle at a supercharger. And with the new Roadster having the range of 1000km, you won't need to stop every 500km (300miles) - even though - you most probably will. One last thing, technology is growing fast, for a year or two, you will charge your vehicle for 5-6 minutes at most, remember what I said :)
