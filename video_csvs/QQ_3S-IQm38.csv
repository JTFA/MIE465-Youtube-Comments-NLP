"I wasn't into this on the first try. I gave it a rest for a few weeks and listened to their older music (including the drones CD), then gave this song a second chance. I still don't like it. Too repetitive in the lyrics and just passable on the instrumental notes. I like the video itself as far as concept and design, just not the song. I realize they are branching out and always trying to find new ways to make a melody (and even the new article in Matt saying that the guitar is now a secondary instrument), but this is not a direction I like. It needs more variety. It's the same damn notes over and over and over. The song ""Reapers"" is the complete polar opposite of this song: Great tune, non-repetitive in both lyrics and melody, massive variety in guitar riffs, and as a bonus there is even a variety in the lines of the chorus. You add in the style/flare that only Muse brings to the table and this is the ultimate combo. There are other great tracks from that CD, but to me this is a signature song and is why they are my favorite band of all time. If Thought Contagion is the new direction that Muse is going, I'll stick with the classics. I'll still be a huge fan, but not of the new stuff.",0.9487,264
