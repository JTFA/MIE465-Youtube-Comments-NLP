Apple and Samsung isnt making anything better. Its new but not better. Why not a bigger battery? Front facing speakers? They won't ever make those better because then all their other products become useless. Who needs wireless charging dongle when you can get solid 8+ hour battery life with heavy gpu and cpu use. Or a speaker or headphones when the front speakers are loud and clear. The brands won't fix stuff that actually matters.,-0.7601,84

"Glued closed + non-user replaceable battery glued to the back of the fragil OLED module inside the phone, making a battery swap likely to break the expensive screen. Glass front & back means a double shatter crack break drop hazard problem. Unethical device repair failure design again! 

In the old days, Samsung made their Note 2 & 3 & 4 with a pop off polymer back that was tough, impact resistant like a sports helmet, where you could swap the battery in seconds. My first two smartphones were Samsung Note 2 & then 3 with this feature. In Samsungs own marketing advertisments they made fun of Apple and iPhone for not having a user replaceable battery, showing iPhone users plugged in waiting for a charge as a stylish young man hot swaps the battery in his Samsung on the go in seconds. Why they diverted away from the S5 active gasket design to gluing glass to the front and back... swiss watch companies could teach them how to use small screws, or they could reverse engineer and iPhone 5S, SE, 6, 6S or 7 for such a design.... not that Apple is without fault for gluing things together, like their iPads and the batteries in their newer macbooks. Microsoft is similarly guilty with their Surface products, of designing sealed non user servicable non-upgradable, sealed, sonic welded, glued devices with soldered connections to the battery, ram, cpu, SSD & HDD. Unethical electric device design means more e-waste sooner, all for next quarters earnings, the unethical high short term profit seeking failure that iFixit is trying to remedy with Device Repair Laws that will force manufactures to design their products in ways that make normal battery and screen repairs plausible/ feasible/ time and cost effective : instead of lifecycle designed obsolescence throwaway one time use, break and buy a new one e-waste increasing designs.",-0.8241,345

"How can all those ""Tech Guys"" not use IR to control TVs, air conditioners, PC monitors, cable boxes/set-tops, AV receivers, media streamers, projectors, home automation (Arduino, etc) etc??? I'm working as a technical manager in 2 companies and I can tell you that numerous times people lose/can't find their remote controls and using my phone to easily on/off/configure/adjust anything I need is just convenient and amazing, apart from that, I also find it very useful in conference rooms, restaurants and hotels where the remotes are not readily available or when I don't feel like using 5 different remotes but instead one. Right now I'm stuck with the Samsung Note4 because apparently there is no demand for the IR blaster anymore so the phone manufacturers stopped including it in their phones.. Why are people not inclined towards convenience and efficiency but instead inclined towards stupid gimmicks like unneeded emojis that they will use 5 times and then forget about it? Instead of promoting useless emojis, explain to people how many tens of thousands of electronic devices they will be able to control for free through their phones if they had an IR blaster in it.",-0.7954,228
