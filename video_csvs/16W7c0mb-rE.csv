Example: if no one teach a little kid people how to steal, how did he steal form other people? If no one teach the other how to bully, how did they bully other people? If no one teach the other how to fight, how some people fight better than the other under the same condition as the other?

You're just touching a part of a whole and that whole interacts with the environment. It is a fractal phenomenon. But to say that an ant colony doesn't have, as a whole, a consciousness is arrogant. At the very least it's alive, it breaths, and it maintains homeostasis. Human society eats coal, oil, plants, and other animals to maintain it's existence. It's possible that the collective is in a sense alive and conscious, but in a way that is well below a baby or toddler.",0.3102,135
