"Fate and circumstance gave us an incredible gift...? True... Mostly. The moon was fated to be and do exactly what it was designed and built to be and do. But they (fate and circumstance), alone, are powerless to give us anything. But there is a source. And that source is powerful enough give us things like suns and moons and a vibrant planet, along with literally countless other significant and seemingly insignificant forms of providence.
But any reasonable person cannot attribute... not just ""many things"" in this finite realm, so that it could still be argued as coincidence... No, because it's every single thing in this realm! Every thing has a place and a purpose. Bar none. That's a horse of a whole nother color.
For that much providence, that takes infinite wisdom, power, strength, willful and authoritative determination.
Creation becomes personal. That's obviously why there are laws. Absolutely authoritative rules and regulations, both physical and moral, or spiritual. Moral and intellectual laws governing the living and physical laws governing the inert.
Moons don't just accumulate from particles circling around planets. Asteroids can fall into the well of gravity around a planet! But an entire moon? No. Not physically possible.
Suns aren't hatched in the Eagle nebula then delivered somewhere by the Stork nebula. There is no natural mechanism to explain how suns are born. Especially not hundreds of billions of trillions of suns. Their existence is born out of the supernatural.
So, there is a source for suns and galaxies and the hundreds of unique, independent features contained in the planets, moons, suns, etc, in the systems we're vaguely aware of!
One perfectly capable of creating, placing and instructing those individual bodies to be and do what they were created to be and do. Like it or not, there is a straight forward, logically sound line of physical, empirical evidence for the creator of this universe to be respected and titled as The Creator of all. 
If you're struggling with that view, it's a personal... An emotional pressure, born of human influence, probably including your own human influence. But it's not a decision born out of observation, exploration, trial and strict scientific inquiry. When a person attributes all of the mastery observed in the grandiose uniformity of nature to time and chance, coupled with nature's attributes, they begin there first, by suppressing everything they know, first hand, in all of their human experience, about the capacities of influence time, chance and nature's attributes are limited to, and they're greatly exaggerating, inflating them to be and do literally thousands and thousands of physically, mathematical, chemically, architecturally impossible feats. Logic doesn't compel anyone to stray down those paths. That's a revealing observation best understood by the fallen spiritual condition mankind suffers this day as every other day, past or future.
God. Ok... I said it. But I didn't have to. We are all very aware of God's character and attributes. Not from books. Not from teachers. And we're not making Him up in our minds.
His power, His moral character, His state of eternal being, His kindness, patients, long suffering attitude, etc, is reflected, clearly, by the things He's made. He spoke creation into existence, and He did so with information, knowledge, profoundly rich intelligibility. Then he designed us, His children, to perceive that knowledge, you be intellectually sated by its profound depths. We learn what God's teaching, minus everything He hasn't yet taught us, the many things we haven't yet learned and everything we've gotten all wrong!
Seek and you will find!
How? Why? Because the message is written in and by everything under your nose.
Creation is a mere medium for communication. God's holding you right now in His spoken word. He's feeding your heart, mind and soul with His providence. 
Roads are a funny thing! They can lead you to or away from a thing. But you get to choose whether you're going to run from or come to a thing. God's on the road. Which way are you going?",0.9927,794

"If the moon disappeared it WOULD be instantly noticeable.  The oceans bulge in the middle of our planet because of the moon, and there would be biblical style flooding all over the entire world, islands everywhere would be erased in an instant from the gravitational snap of the moon's gravity pulling on our oceans suddenly vanishing.  Entire ecosystems would be annihilated forever. Our planets rotation would speed up right away, causing vastly more violent wind speeds and weather.  We would almost certainly be seeing the worst dying since the ice age itself.",-0.8437,100
If the moon was broken into pieces and those pieces were clustered together in orbit around the Earth their collective gravity would still cause tides.,-0.4767,26
"If the moon was destroyed Earth will eventually lose its magnetic field.  Eventually looking like Mars.  Mars lost its moon 4 billion years ago that why it has no magnetic field today all that it remains is two Asteroid alike body trapped in Mars orbit that is left over of what was part of Mars moon. If Mars had Earth moon it would probably be a livable planet today or easy to terraform it to be. Mars lost its water and most of it thick atmosphere out to space due to solar winds and radiation because of losing its magnetic field that the a Moon once create for it. Moons play a important part to sustain life bringing right conditions for a planet to sheld against solar winds of our Sun including control ocean and weather, also rotation stability. What Mars have is two large Asteroid alike body not enough to influence the planet stability to bring what Earth moon does., and Earth fate will be the same as Mars if our moon disappeared.  Unfortunately Earth Moon is moving away from Earth to outer space one day leaving Earth to die. As Mars.",-0.9349,205
