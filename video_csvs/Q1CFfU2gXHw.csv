"""Superior offerings""? What superior offerings are you talking about? If you're talking about virtual assistant speakers then you're completely missing the point of Homepod. It's not supposed to be a virtual assistant first. It's a high quality speaker first and Siri functionality is just an additional add on. That's why Apple spent so much time talking about the 7 amplifier and 8 array tweeter/woofer layout, its spatial awareness, and the quality of its sound. Siri was not the main focus. Good sounding speakers start at way higher price points and if the Homepods sound as good or better than speakers like the sonos play 5, or other high quality wireless speakers, I think the price is very competitive.",0.961,134

"CoolCarl222--I love your provocative take on Google phones overtaking iPhones.  Let's see last year it was it was Apple 217 million and Google 1.5 million.  Ooo, it's not looking good for an overtaking.  How many decades are you giving yourself to be right?  You didn't say when this would happen?  And one other question please, Google has made phones since 2010, whose fault is it that they were only on 1 carrier last year?

By the way, I'm an investor in Google so I don't dislike them, I want them to do well, it's just that their phone strategy seems real inept.

Oh and one other small detail.  Siri no longer uses Bing, in their last negotiation they began using the Google data base.  Hmmm.",0.7561,146
"CoolCarl222--Oh CoolCarl, it's so sad when you are so wrong.  You said: ""Apple's market is going to shrink because people get smarter each year"" Not only did Apple have an all-time record quarter financially, they also announced an interesting nugget.  In the last 2 years the number of active Apple devices has grown from 1 billion to 1.3 billion.  Maybe it's just me but that looks like a lot of growth and no shrinkage.  Don't take it too hard, you're still young and could perhaps grow a brain.",0.4782,103
"CoolCarl222--So what you're saying is Google Pixel will outsell iPhone in 3 years?

Oh and an important change, when you weren't looking Google went ahead and licensed their search data base to Apple.  Siri doesn't use Bing anymore.  Might have to change that argument.

Let's talk on Feb 1, that's the day Apple and Google announce December quarter results.  What do you say on iPhone sales?  A hundred million maybe?  Or is that too many?  By the way, Google probably won't announce their phones sales, too embarrassing.",-0.644,104

Back to your last remark, it confused me.  You said: ""You're free to think whatever"".  This isn't about what I think, it's about what Google and Apple announce on Feb 1.  Cut and dried, black numbers on white paper.  If what you say is happening, we will see it in the numbers.

My rant lol I don't  know how I feel about this I love Apple but they always seem late to the party I stick with iPhone and Apple TV because they are easy to use I just bought 2nd gen echo and hooked it up speaker sounds pretty good not great but where I use it it does the trick and have all my smart home tech connected so I'll be buying a couple dots in feature until Apple opens up more products to HomeKit like Nest I seen amazon on the Apple TV so I have feeling Nest products should be compatible with home kit sooner then later otherwise Apple will miss a lot unless they come out with there own Security system and cameras thermostats,0.9782,127

"Paul-- Your response is very reasonable for your lifestyle.  For my lifestyle I already own a Sonos which cost more than 400 dollars and doesn't have very good integration with Apple Music.  However I do currently use the Sonos a great deal, so I'm sure the HomePod in my case will be put to good use.",0.3469,62

I was clearly very wrong. 350$ for what I am sure will be a decent speaker, but for 350 I could easily get a better speaker from Bose. Siri is terribly far behind, and clearly isn't going to get better. Apple is clearly not the company it used to be. They just continue to release products that clearly are not finished, but they release them anyway. They know they have a loyal base of customers that will not question anything they do, and will cough up whatever amount they ask, regardless of how mediocre it is.

"Undoubtedly Apple likes coming from behind in your rear view mirror to create a better version of what’s currently trending, however I would love to see them be an innovator in first to market products that are more visions of the future. I guess their current approach is a safer one allowing others to take on the risk while Apple cleans up for its investors. Smart business wise, but it seems Apple is moving away from creativity, and more towards marketing, packaging, and creating improved versions of what’s already out there.

Probably to give Siri some updates. And, you’re saying that this is a poor release BEFORE it comes out? Really? You’re guessing. You shouldn’t be rating something based on a guess.
