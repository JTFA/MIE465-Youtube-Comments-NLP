I'd prefer they just not show Samantha Jones though.    I'd rather them just say she got back with Smith(I hated that they broke up) and she's off on location doing something with him then just focus on the other girls.  Or working on some amazing project with a new client in a secret location.",0.8287,119

All the ladies are getting older and maybe Samantha is tired of playing a wh*re? I think the dynamic of all four women was wonderful and I don't think any of them can just replaced and it be the same. Kind of like The Golden Girls when they tried to do that spinoff called Golden Palace without Dorothy and it just didn't work. These ladies are 4 different personalities and they all bring something to the table and have chemistry with each other. I don't think a movie would work without any one of them. Just have to let it go and enjoy the reruns.",0.9489,145

If you pay Kim her fair salary then I'm sure she'd do it. SJP is too greedy to let that happen since she has to be the star.  We all know Samantha is the most interesting character anyway.,0.5984,41
"It would take a brave soul to replace any of the 4 ladies in a 3rd movie. No matter how perfect they were for the role, they would be scorched by a lot of die-hard fans. Would be a really tough decision to either kill off Samantha, have her out of town, or replace Kim. None of them are ideal and would upset fans. Maybe they'll decide to just not do it.

I think it would make for a great reason for the girls to get together and just show another aspect of their friendship which would be grieving for a friend and coming to terms with it as well as entertaining new friendships, some may take well into it while others may not, that would make for a great storyline and character development for each of them.",0.9601,105

"Say the movie begins with Samantha's funeral. A big photograph of her displayed at the funeral. Although sad and not ideal, it would be understood she died peacefully with her girls, Stanford, and Smith at her bedside. She also marries Smith on her deathbed. The movie continues with the girls in their never-ending New York struggles along with dealing with the aftermath of Samantha's death. An occasional ""What would Samantha do"" moment, along with some flashbacks from the series that featured Samantha. Little ways to keep Kim/Samantha in the picture as much as possible.",-0.9475,109

Sharon Stone is soo Intelligent and pretty..A total package woman! But honeslty  dont consider her to play as samantha. I want her to play a movie that more of classy and heavy drama that will show how good actress she is.. A movie that doesnt required her to be naked on  tv/screen. Shes too old for this!,0.9295,66
