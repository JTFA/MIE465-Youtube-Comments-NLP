"Hello  MeUs  :)



Let's Fix The Stream.

I know that not everyone can be in front of the computer all the day and stream‚Ä¶
...but everyone can leave their computer turned on :)
My idea - to make the streaming automatic. I saw fans of some groups to streaming with  playlist. The playlist should not contain just one video.   Must not to be the same video one after the other.  The main video and other video should alternate. For example:
any uneven video - ‚ÄúLower‚Äù
any even video -  another  f(x) video -> (check out my playlists as an example)
If LOOP is set on the playlist - it will work indefinitely. In the stream-instructions are recommended to exit the account. So that, Sign Out in YouTube account. If this method works - every computer can stream automatically 24 hours a day.

If you have some spare time, please visit my channel in YouTube. I'm trying to make an automatic streaming with the playlist-loop.  On my channel I uploaded my video - ""testvideo"". On my channel I made my playlist - ""testlist"". I set a LOOP on the playlist. Browser Settings and Other Settings are in the first comment on ""testvideo"". I have already automatically generated over 370 views.

Fact, no one watches my video  :)  Over 370 views  :)  Perhaps this method works :)

I noticed the following thing:
Sometimes the counter freezes. Not counting all views. I guess everyone has seen this.  :(
So far, I have not noticed a reduction in my views. It means they are not counted as bad views. This is good.  :)

PLEASE ALL  - do not hurry to  this method right away!

|| or you have properly set up your browser and everything is OK  :) ,  or you have wrongly set up your browser and just waste your electricity :(   ||

1st - Let everyone upload their own video in YouTube.  First test it.
2nd - Let everyone make their own playlist.  For example: ‚ÄúLower‚Äù + ‚Äúown video‚Äù.
3nd - Test a few days how it works. Whether the Browser settings are working properly.  If everything is OK - let it work  :)  Let's Stream :)",0.9848,423
"Hello MeUs :)



The Automatic Stream is Reality :)

(Check out my previous comment first)
In 6 days I automatically generated 1,000 views of my video. The same amount of views I probably generated to 'Lower'. At this stage, I do not suggest something that is 100% perfect. But the only thing to do is stay the computer turn on and nothing more. If someone is busy all day and can not be in front of the computer - these are 0 views. If someone is busy, but his computer turned on - for 6 hours can generate automatically 50 views to one video and 50 views to the other video. If you like and check my method - 1000 fans can make 1 million views each week. We currently have 100K views of 'Lower' every week.

I noticed the following thing: 
Sometimes the counter freezes. Not counting all views.
If freezing lasts for a short time (10-30min) - then missed views are added :)
If freezing lasts for a long time (1-3 hours) - then missed views are not added :(
So far, I have not noticed a reduction in my views. It means they are not counted as bad views. This is good. :)
The counter freezes every 12 hours for 2-3 hours :(
Only 60% of all views are counted.

PLEASE EACH OF YOU:

Always check every idea you are taking. Check out your own streaming methods. The only way to do this is upload your own video and test it. If you like my idea - check it out first (in my previous comment I wrote how to check it out). While you are checking my idea how it works - you will also generate automatic streaming to 'Lower' :) If you have questions, you will easily find me.

Please the fans of the other groups - not to look for me or ask me questions!",0.9912,363

"Shannia Joseph   I think something useful. In the streaming instructions, it is recommended to delete the history and the cache. In fact, it is possible to set the browser not to remember the history and cache should be as small as possible. So the playlist stream will work correctly.

Options --> Privacy --> History --> (in the drop-down menu is selected) Never remember history --> set OK (Firefox is need to restaring)
see this video --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEGFzDN8S5k

Options --> Advanced --> Network --> Cached Web Content --> –úark (Override automatic cache managment) and SET Limit cache to 0 MB of space. --> set OK

ivan cho i dont think im si good at leading  but if you know anyone willing to take the lead in. We can have a Playlist and have it play. When i wake up mine plays until I'm ready to go work.

Thanks for the link. I'll check it out. Check it out too. The only way to check is on your own video. Check for at least a few days. You have to see if there is a freezing of the views.  :)",0.6705,50
savannah lex     at the moment everything that gives the views is good. But test it so you really know how many views you get :),0.7096,26
"savannah lex   I forgot to mention something important. Set the cache to the minimum size. This helps to get some additional views. If you use Firefox try through a private window. If you get more than 30% it will be very good. Problem of Loop's method with a playlist of the same clips (youloop.org -automatic reloading of a page) quickly freeze views. If you have more time, test how many views you can get before freezing views. The bad thing is that the freezing of the views lasts for hours.",-0.1243,103
"savannah lex  Hello :)
I tested the link you sent me. Of 100 generated views (with youloop.org) I have 23 views counted. These are 23%.  This works by method - reloading the page. Or similar to the playlist of the one same video.  
Please check with you how it works. Upload your own video and test it. This is the only way to check how if something works.  If there is any result write to me. Thanks in advance.  :)",0.8807,93

"what I noticed that the playlist does not just contain their new video. The playlist alternates the new video and another group video.
–ïvery second video is the new video.
In my view, the general rules for streaming should also be followed:
Resolution greater than 480p.
Sound over 50%
The browser may be set to not remember the history.
I need to check how the cache can be automatically cleared. (I still do not know how)",0.4404,87

But for the question of 100 million views, it's hard to answer. There are videos that have more than 300 million views  and personally I only looked at them once and did not repeat. There are videos I personally consider a masterpiece,  but in  two years they have just 1 million views.",0.8555,79
