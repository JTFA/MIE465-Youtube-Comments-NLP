well, its not all bad if nobody gets hurt
losing a 50 year old 4 bedroom + 2 bath worth $2.5 million dollars doesnt hurt to badly when you come to realize that conservatives in red states insurance premiums are going to sky rocket rebuilding and replacing our homes with brand new ones.
knowing that these conservatives live in houses only worth $300000 is humorous.

keep hating retard.
make sure mommy and daddy make their insurance payments on time.
we are waiting for red state conservative dollars to replace and rebuild our homes. 
MAGA! dumb ass.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!",-0.3641,111
"That's why fire insurance costs everyone in every other state so much money.

Why all people waste their time on fire? Just let the fire burn all then everything will be ok after that. Just relax and happy because you all who have a house will get money back 100% plus Extra Bonus. 70 year ago your house only 70.000 now your house is 750000. What do you want more? Illegal will come and buy your house.,0.3542,71
