Oh boy oh boy how much people would try to erase his achievements. Im hoping youre just being a goof ball though, but praying for you regardless 🙏🏼. because most haters are people whove been hurt in their life and cant help it until they are fully healed. Hope you will be just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel soon.

"I remember when Jerry West was signed up by the Warriors in 2011, the first big move he made was trade Monte Ellis to give the keys to Steph Curry. 

What ever happened to Monte Ellis?

Just like how he traded Eddie Jones (and Elden Campbell) to get Glen Rice because Eddie and Kobe played the same position. I trust The Logo.

It hurts now and will continue to hurt for awhile but there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Jerry West chose Kobe over Eddie and Steph over Monte and it was the right call for both. It's not a popular trade (salary dump) now but it is better off in the long haul. 

Tobias Harris is actually one of the most underrated players in the league while Blake is overrated. Boban is 7-3 and was Serbian teammates to Miloš. Bradley is a defensive stopper like Pat Bev. Clippers actually got deeper in this deal.",0.681,175
