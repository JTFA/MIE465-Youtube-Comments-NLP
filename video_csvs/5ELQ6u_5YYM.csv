"As a huge fun of the show, i was disappointed from this new season-and i
 say this with a heavy heart as it took me days to admit this season 
fell short.- I loved the ambience of the episodes and the cast but there
 where things missing and from my point of view the most vital.The plots
 were good and some mediocre.What really bothered me though was the lack
 of ideas(messages). I was ready once again to question people and our 
shitty societies but the chance didn't appear..           Just advanced 
technology, effects , colors, the expected ''unexpected'' plots here and
 there and that's it..what is the 9,1 hung the dj supposed to make me 
question? How creating sentient beings in an application and having them
 do a test only to disappear after is even relevant to our societies? i 
dont see this happening and i dont see how it is a reason for people to 
deteriorate ... maybe a proof of what we ve became (killing 1000 
sentient simulations to find our match) .That's all i see (i'm really 
wondering though , if you know something enlighten me!).                
                                                  After watching this

 mirror was special and unique (in my heart ) because it spoke the truth
 about important matters. This season it was just an ordinary show with 
good plots ,  effects   and shiny colors....",0.9521,267

"My favourite out of this season was definitely Arkangel  and Hang the DJ.
Oh and I have an idea for a future black mirror episode and would love to see something along the lines of it. 
Based on blacklash against offensive content by content creators. 
So there will be apps and data collecting services that record what would be offensive to one's target audience, wider audience and general public. It will break down what demographic will be offended or otherwise. Every time a content creator wants to post something, it runs through the app (for content mostly posted by phone) and program (edited video content for a channel) to determine if it is safe to post. And there will be determining factors, for instance age, ethnicity and gender of the creator with a crucial column of 'passes for ______' . 
The service will also include estimated risk if the content is published and potential management strategies if there is backlash when the content is posted. It will also alert you if someone has posted something significantly detrimental to your reputation (based on their following, influence and timing of post)  with suggested strategies to minimize damage. 
Potential ending(s): Mainstream resorts to covert racism/sexism/whatever-ism because followers are less forgiving and creators are not allowed to make mistakes. Covert ____-ism is normalized because the app cannot detect it. A growing popularity of creators that deliberately offend because some audiences are tired of the PC-ness of it all. Also, those creators use a modified version of the app that provide offensive suggestions based on content that has already been created but cancelled in the final upload stages. 
Hopefully they already have a similar idea and will make something like it!",0.6412,322
