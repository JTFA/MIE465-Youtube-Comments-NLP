"+Goblin98 Goblinovsky Although Junkie XL promised an evolution of character's themes such as Batman's majestic ""Men Are Still Good"" and a theme for each new member of the Justice League, we never got to hear it, instead we're shoved Elfman's ""family friendly"" generic crap down our throats. Wonder Woman reshoots were obvious with the bomb never exploding inside as seen in the trailers. The camera work was again amateur and campy. Movie's villian also suffered from the reshoots. He lacked any substance as much as the whole movie. The red skies in Chernobyl (which Whedon falsely thinks is in ""Mother Russia"") were also part of the changes paired with the crystal-like tentacles which were inserted only for the sake of the audience seeing ""Superman"" saving a building.",0.8807,147
"+Goblin98 Goblinovsky Overall, the movie which many people have been awaiting their whole lives and was suppossed bring us and epic conclusion to the story started in Man of Steel deeply disappointed but most importantly, had no takeaway. You leave the theater feeling nothing except maybe dissapointment and sadness. There is no awe, no good felling, no curiosity, no theories, motives, themes or complex topics to think about or discuss. Many people have raised their voices in support of Zack Snyder, the visionary director who was pushed away from finishing his movie. Fans and the director himself deserve an epic finale to the previous masterpieces from DC cinematic universe. That is why we the fans have created a petion to push Warner Bros. to let Zack finish the original version of his movie.

"+Goblin98 Goblinovsky Snyder went to shoot Aquaman scene's on location in Greenland. What did we get? Scene that was previously funny did not come of as great when said by Fatffleck but most importantly all the beautiful footage was now substituted with green-screen! What a tragedy! I guess nobody cared about Cyborg because all the scene's that were suppossed +Goblin98 Goblinovsky to make us care about him were cut and the ones that were good were reshot. There is much more that puts this movie in shames and explains everyone's disappointment. In addition to everything that was changed from Zack Snyder's original vision, the editing of the movie, over saturation and over exposition also play huge roles",0.9567,129
"13:15 yes, Zeus.  It might be Shazam too.  My favorite line is still Batman's quip response to Flash: ""I'm rich."" And yeah, the ""Do you bleed"" line from Kal-El was great.  the end battle was great, and I actually liked Batman bringing in ""the big guns"" just in case their plan to convince Clark/Kal-El/Superman from death. 
My favorite moments: the easter eggs of the old theme musics used-Danny Elfman's Michael Keaton Batman theme when Batfleck first showed up(and throughout the entire film) and the brief nod to John Williams' Superman theme when Supes finally showed up; including the end scenes of course.  Was that the Joker or Penguin?  34:14 Wasn't Clark Kent supposedly reporting in Afghanistan? (or one of the world's hot spots)",0.9536,153

"Affleck's scenes were comparably horrible as the actor gained weight between the shoots and seems totally annoyed and out of character. His performance in BvS delivered us a true charismatic impersonation of Bruce Wayne while forgetting we were looking at the famous actor. The reshoots accomplished giving us a fat Ben Affleck in and out of the costume trying to play Batman. At some points the reshot scenes were so ridiculous because of Affleck's appearance, camera work, editing and writing that the outcome was close to Clooney's debut as The Caped Rrusader. There was a reason why Wonder Woman's theme, created by the legendary Hans Zimmer and music genius Junkie XL,was played on electric guitars. Wonder Woman fans  can be happy they at least got the watered down version of their character's theme. All previous wonderful works of both composer's started in Snyder's Man of Steel by Zimmer and Tom Holkenborg's year of work on Justice League have been scraped.",0.9491,172

Most of marvel films are fun and have a story look at spiderman homecoming they didn't even go rebooting his original story they start you to like the character

"I think one major challenge DC has that Marvel doesn't have to contend with to nearly the same degree is just how iconic DC's characters are, especially Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman in the larger, non-comic book reading collective consciousness.

The greater part of the movie going audience are not as familiar with the actual comics but filmmakers have to get these butts in seats too as just targeting the hardcore fans would be a relatively small, niche market that could not justify the budget needed to do these movies justice. DC characters, especially Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman are cultural icons that have been around forever and general movie going audiences, unfamiliar with the comics and more contemporary arcs, have certain expectations, rigid one's largely grounded on ""classic"" Golden Age representations of these characters, especially DC's ""holy trio"". They are cultural icons in a way Marvel characters are not. As such, the potential to fall short of such deep, rigid expectations is inherently quite high.

Marvel, on the other hand, is not restrained nearly as much by such expectations as even tent pole Marvel characters like Spiderman and The Hulk are not nearly as iconic in the larger cultural collective as DC. Coupled with Marvel introducing characters that are lesser known even among Marvel readers actually gives them a lot of creative freedom and a buffer from falling short of expectations except for the most hardcore Marvel fans as there really aren't any expectation for general audiences to begin with, not with characterization anyway.

I do believe with Wonder Woman and the course correct they have begun with Justice League that the DCU is salvageable, it's just going to be a little slow and painful in the returns for the next little while before they make up for any wearied audience goodwill. Things are actually looking up just as long as WB execs don't panic and make dumb, reactionary decisions like they have in the past.",0.9944,357
"I think the problem with getting to Superman earlier, is the same problem they will have with every one of these Justice League films, and that is as soon as he joined the team and the fight, Stepenwolf got his ass kicked. bringing him in earlier would have just ended the film earlier. still I'm glad I wacthed the film and didnt listen to the negative reviews, because I really enjoyed this film.",-0.6378,80
"I thought Justice League was Great! Loved It! I know few issue. One thought on way they brought Superman back. In this Movie Universe, between Man Of Steel and BvS, I maybe wrong, but Superman has not established his fortress of solitude. He has not had time to have contigencey plan that fortress robots come take his body and put him in black suit and regeneration solar chamber. Not saying I love the way they brought him back but in context of DC films so far, this was how they felt best to bring him back. Just my 2 cents.

"JL was a really fun movie, but it was disappointing . This was not the film I had imagined after seeing the trailers. 

1) I feel WB departed way too much in the tone. This movie should have felt like a conclusion to the Superman arc from MOS and BVS. I would have liked to see things from MOS and BVS tied into this. The luthor demon painting and knightmare scene hinted at something more sinister but we got a silly throw away villian. There were no stakes, Doomsday was more of a threat than Steppenwolf. 

2)The score was weak IMO. One thing DCEU had going for it was its themes. Compare MOS theme, WW theme, Batmans theme and a beautiful lie from BVS to JL. I hate that Joss fired Junkie XL and got such a generic score instead. 

3) This movie didn't feel epic. The fight on Krypton in MOS, the warehouse scene in BVS was better than any action in this film. It just felt really simple and basic with no real stakes involved. Compare the superman montage scene from BVS or Supermans first flight in MOS to JL it just seems really generic. 

4)¬† My biggest issue was with supermans resurrection. I wanted to see more of how the world was reacting without Superman. I wanted to see how steppenwolf and the para demons were cauing havoc in the real world, which would have made Supermans return that much more satisfying. It would have been amazing if Steppenwolf was the one who revived superman and set him on the JL. Imagine supes with long hair and beard and black suit against the JL. I wanted to see superman flying through metropolis at the end after really saving the world from Steppenwolf and the hope in lois and everyones eyes when they see him alive again. The dream scene of clark in the trailer with lois had more of an emotional impact than the scenes we got in the movie.",-0.9037,365

"The stupid whiny complaining people are just going to hate anything DC does I think they have proven that already, because it's trendy to hate on DC, then all us DC fans don't get our movies because they actually listen and fear these stupid non-comic book superhero fans bitching their heads off",-0.9652,54
The whole incoherent story about Superman‚Äôs death from BvS into justice League furthers highlights how incompetent Snyder is at story telling and telling this story. God bless him and his family but this man should not be directing Big budget movies.,0.0387,45
"The whole ‚ÄúHe said you‚Äôd come‚Äù scene is fine getting cut as it‚Äôs already been confirmed Alfred was taking to Superman. This would make Superman‚Äôs entrance in the climax less impactful, so I‚Äôm glad the scene was cut. Also‚ÄîParademons would be the ultimate weapon against Yellow Lanterns lol.",0.3566,64
"They absolutely botched the resurrection of Superman. I could not believe they just repeated that plot point from BVS, it was so, so, so lazy.",-0.6019,30
"They could've explained away Superman's black suit as a ""solar suit"" from Wayne Tech (the color black absorbs all wavelengths of light). He'd need the Solar Suit to rapidly recharge his powers, after being buried for so long. That could also be used later to explain any flux in his power levels in any subsequent movies.",0.0,64
"They removed ""and the american way"" from superman, because ""the american way"" has never tied in with truth and justice throughout history, and is usually the complete opposite.",0.6908,35
They should have stuck with the idea of having two parts for this movie.  Superman came back too early and they missed an opportunity to really do a great job establishing all of the new characters.  Show us the league defeating a threat w/o Supes then bring him back in part two to fight a larger threat... Darksied. That establishes the league and sets Superman up with a more compelling come back story.,-0.3461,80
They should've been pushing a Superman-centric campaign coming into the second weekend. Anyone that really wanted a spoiler free movie would've/should've went to it within the first week. It's not like it wasn't obvious.,0.3514,39
They were only 5 people in the movie theater watching the Justice League that was f****** sad,0.0772,20

"This movie is just a ok movie, a real let down for the DC universe, it shouldv've been a great, exceptional movie and don't compare it to Avengers, JL is several steps behind Avengers",0.743,38
"This movie was a C- at best . This movie would have dope in like 1996 üòÇ. At least BVS tried to be different , it wasn't executed well, but it was ambitious .  This is a paint by numbers block buster , trying to be the avengers , while ripping concepts from lord of the rings . Don't call me a marvel fan boy either . The dark knight trilogy , batman (1989), batman the animated series and justice league unlimited are my favorite. But even as fans we have to recognize when something is crap , and demand that our heros deserve better . This is JUSTICE LEAGUE, it should be one of the most epic films in the world but it wasn't , it was on par with the 1999 Godzilla with Mathew Broderick",0.9688,145
This movie was amazing!!!,0.6884,7
"This movie was just so average  saw it once in theaters  and another time online , I thought it was ok first time but I certainly didn‚Äôt love it , flat out didn‚Äôt like it second time out  , worst comicbook movie of year by a country mile imo",0.7964,53
This movie was surprisingly good..I didn't like batman v superman or suicide scuide but I like justice League.,0.0593,21
"This movie was totally and absolutely AWESOME! I agree with needing more Superman and the pointless floating rocks on the grave being frustrating. I disagree with your cut ideas because the Barry and his father scene was crucial imo. I am low key super upset we didn't get to see the Supergirl hologram and Alfred saying ""he said you would come."" Overall I thought the villain was formidable, every single character was perfect, and the scenes flowed smoothly. I think the movie should have been 2 1/2 hours long for sure because like I said there were some great scenes/shots in the trailer I was definitely missing, oh well though! 8/10!",0.9126,126

To the point that they know everything about the movie before they even go see it. The watch every bit of footage, they read the blogs and they search for every spoiler.

These movies would be much better if you knew nothing about them. 
By the end of it it's not worth them even giving the $10 for the movie.",0.8569,106
Wonder  Woman told Steppenwolf you hiding inside while  the battle is outside was awesome the look Superman gave to the Flash and when he said you guys are still fighting this guy and he threw Steppenwolf to the floor and that Super Breath seen and when Aquaman had told the truth with Laso in his hand man it was damn good to me the Green Lantern at beginning Cyborg saying Booya Aquaman and Mera scene those Amazon's kicking ass and Flash vs Superman race,0.5994,84
Yeah I assumed it was Zeus,0.296,6
"Yeah i felt same way John, Man of Steel felt like the world was discovering aliens and Bvs had too much of that.  Anderson Cooper every 5 seconds. Lol.  But JL had none of it. Not a huge problem,  but i wish the government or world acknowledged what was going on.",0.765,58
Yes Superman did look like a Video game when he was fighting Stefenwolf. Side by side. But Good Movie tho. Wonder Woman was better,0.8176,27

"You have yet to make the point of how WB has interfere mid way through production of 3 of its 5 DCEU movies. One thing Marvel doesn't do is back down or redirect when a movie under performs. The just continue with their plan. You can't make drastic changes to movie after movie and still have a connected universe that feel cohesive. The stories for BvS, Suicide Squad, and Justice league are all over the plan and any connective tissue between the movies doesn't really line up because of it. They should of just stuck to their guns from the beginning when they were shooting BvS and just pressed on. Same with suicide squad. Instead they kept over reacting to critics even though the movies were making serious money and would of continued if they just built on each other instead of trying to rework everything every few months",-0.8074,158
You know you've failed when BVS has a better opening than the Justice League.,0.4588,15
You really are not understanding that films like JL with a run time of 3hr 30mins would have been RECEIVED by a Global Audience as a Cinematic Epic. Just like the Golden Age of the 1950s Epic...Sorry J Campea you r always biased towards Cinemas cramming in as many shows with a shorter run time. Look at Lotr each film was a theatrical 3hr run time give or take..So pls see it from the BIGGER perspective!!!!,0.6562,85

"i really enjoyed Ray Fisher/Cyborg and he really is cut short with his story. There was something REALLY interesting there and his back story is not here as if you look at all the trailers you can see there was more to his character. In fact, there was more to Flash and Aquaman which was cut short. Cyborg is the one character with GREAT potential with his solo film. 
Steppenwolf has a great beginning, his battle in Themyscara was fantastic and showed his true power. Gradually his character just became not even a boss character, but, a sub-sub boss once Superman arrived who as way too OP 
To me, Superman's return also felt very, for a lack of a better word, meh. It happened, he's there and it was anti-climactic. Superman returning is absolutely obvious but as you know, say, wrestling returns when the audience anticipates it, the return has to be grand.",0.9214,174

"‚ñ†Both DC & Marvel Universe have their own hardcore fans and that's the way it's always been.‚ñ†
For the vast general moviegoers however,  TIMING is everything!
After much saturation of superhero flix, only the hardcore remains...
Despite the superb quality & plots of JL which if it came out right after the first Avenger movie (when everything was still ""re-fresh"" about superheroes), I'm sure that it would've given the latter a run for it's money...
At present, the box-office difference makers are only half interested with these kind of movies.
You can only take in so much at a given ""season""...that is why even with nature, we have 4 different seasons in a year!
My hunch was right from the start of this, JL will have a sluggish start, but the half-tired public will eventually catch up and JL will still end up a revenue winner in the end...including the outside US returns.
The child in all of us will ALWAYS be fascinated with superpowers!
As for me personally, I'm looking forward to a movie also dealing about superpower, however it's coming out with an ideal timing when the viewers has been missing this genre of a movie...
it's the kind of superpower that really existed in the real world...with very human elements, because it happened in real life!.. 
SAMSON - out on Feb 2018!
That, is going to be a monster, in the box office!",0.9608,275
