"Ale Irigoyen I would not want Lindsey & Mark to do exactly Maks & Meryl‚Äôs dance!
 I love Mark‚Äôs choreography on this one & any other time over Maks,regardless of genre & music! I love the way Mark & Lindsey made it their own!

"Daniel Guizar Nope Meryl did alot better. This was great I would have gave it a high score but Meryl was without doubt superior. This dance was Meryl & Maks really showed why they are the best couple of this show, it sucks she was giving their tango. Their chemistry and technique was insane in S18. Lindsey did amazing but I couldn't help but to compare to like len said ""Meryl The Great""",0.9565,80

"For all of you saying that it doesn't compare to Meryl and Mak's dance. Of course it doesn't because they weren't supposed to top it, Mark even said so in the live interview after. He said they weren't trying to make it better or make it their own but instead he said they were paying tribute to it. He even said in the video package that yes Meryl and Maks definitely had a chemistry that would be very, VERY difficult to recreate which is understandable as to why he didn't try to focus on that so much and instead focused more on the dance itself. Trying to recreate an iconic dance is a challenge in general. So yeah, it's not THE iconic dance but it's a pretty good tribute. When you're not comparing the two they're both very good dances. Even if you do compare the two, you can tell Mark wasn't trying to copy the dance step for step, but he also wasn't trying to top it. With a dance as respectable as Meryl and Mak's why disrespect it and try to make it better? Mark is a very talented dancer so I can definitely see where he was coming from when he explained his motives for the choreo of the iconic dance. And you can also tell that Lindsey was trying to respect it as well. Though she does tend to make things her own in her own cute, special way, she also knows when to respect something and not modify it for herself. I think she did a fantastic job with this iconic dance and definitely deserved a better score than what she received. I'm sorry for ranting but please don't give then a hard time when it doesn't fit our expectations. All the dancers and competitors are working very hard to nail each routine but also put their whole selves and full emotion into the dances. Great work Lindsey and Mark! All my votes go to you both and I really, really hope that you can win the mirrorball!!",0.998,369
Her dances are the best and far more entertaining than Jordan's,0.8122,11

"Hmmm...In my opinion Lindsey and Mark are amazing dancers but they perform weak choreographies
I'm expecting from their dances more moves that are spectacular, looking harder to do
But on the other hand it's hard to make choreos like that when Lindsey is on tour and she has less amount of time to prepare something like that
Anyway I love the contemporary one that they've performed this week :'3",0.9387,74
Honestly the 1st time I ever heard of Lindsey stiring was when she performed all of me on the violin in Season 18 for Meryl & Maks and after that I looked her up on YouTube and been a fan ever since. She's did good in this dance,0.802,49
"Honestly, I feel like them putting up the wrong video for Lindsey and Mark shows a lack of support from the DWTS producers. If these two lose, it'll be a bigger tragedy than the Red Wedding from Game of Thrones. #TeamStark for the mirror ball!",-0.68,50
I don't like this performance at all.,-0.2755,8
"I don't remember if they've done this concept before on the show, but i hope they don't do it again. like Maks said, you can't compare art to art. Maks choreographed this dance for Meryl. the two of them had some of the most intense chemistry I've ever seen on the show, and Lindsey and mark just don't have that. this dance does not fit Lindsey or mark, and i don't think its fair that they ended up with it. the other dances that the couples got, challenged them with steps, this dance forced lindsey and mark be people they aren't and that was definitely reflected.",0.4275,118
"I don't think anyone can recreate what Meryl did, but Lindsey was still awesome. And seriously, not one perfect score tonight for her? I hope Mark choreographs a perfect freestyle and blows the roof off the place because I'm sick and tired of her being underscored",-0.7779,50

But Calvin Harris is EDM not tango

I enjoyed it.  The music doesn't really feel very Tango to me.   I actually prefered her Argentine Tango to Human that was more iconic dance than even this one in my opinion.,0.5106,35
I feel like the outfits were the biggest problem. They should have worn white or some bright color that could stand out. It was really hard for me to see what they were doing and the lines and stuff because they just blended in with the background.,-0.0498,50
I feel like they should have challenge them not giving this dance since this dance was for the chemistry Maks & Meryl had but they did amazing and all my votes are for Lindseyüíï,0.7637,35
"I honestly think it was a HUGE mistake to even throw this dance in as a choice to be recreated/paid tribute to. The original with Meryl and Maks is probably THE MOST perfect dance I've ever seen on the show, no point in even trying to have something just inspired by it. 
Mark did the best he good, but he and Lindsey absolutely do not have the chemistry needed to pull this style off. It was awkward. :/",0.7565,86
I just rewatched Maks and Meryl. this looks like trash in comparison but I give them respect for trying. they paid homage,0.7096,24
"I know that people are saying this dance didn't completely work or compare to Maks and Meryl due to the lack of romantic chemistry but did you expect them to have that?
 I mean I didn't think they would, Mark is married first of all, so of course, that chemistry likely would not be there, not saying that being married prevents that chemistry, but it definitely can hinder it. I think this was just a hard dance to do and match in general considering Maks and Meryl's relationship and partnership on the show, so the DWTS producers gave them a really challenging challenge.",0.7787,112
"I love Lindey and her perfomances, but this one I hated... without brightness, joyness.. I don't know how to explain, but it could be more exciting. (Kisses from Brazil! :)",0.8707,38

I personally don't think this did a lot of justice to Meryl and Maks. But it did a whole lot of honor for Lindsey,0.765,25
"I think they have great chemistry, just not the kind that would have made me like that dance. Imagine if Meryl and Maks were asked to do their Argentine Tango (I think it was). No matter how hard they tried to make it theirs, I think I would have cringed. You can't compare art to art, but not all art should be reinterpreted. Anyway, it's just one dance and I am really looking forward to their freestyle. Mark is probably even more inspired to make something authentic to them.",0.8152,101

It's hard to recreate Meryl's tango she had a more romantic connection with her partner. Lindsey has a connection with her partner but it's not romantic like Meryl's I wish they could have recreated a different dance I don't know if the producers chose for her or mark did,0.7698,50
"It's interesting to see how another person's choreography sits on certain people... perhaps Sasha and Simone's fun charleston would have sat better on these two? In all honesty, I think everything Mark creates is iconic... I especially LOVED his stuff with Paige, just brilliant! Mark and Lindsay's tango has got to be THE MOST iconic EVER though :) ... would love to see another couple replicate it in future :)",0.9878,76

Kiki Cinza I love them as partners but to me what was painful was the song choice. I loved the dancing but the song threw me off so bad. To me it wasnt something I could enjoy watching tango to.,-0.7635,43

Laktoseintrigant Whoever wrote the description worded it weirdly. Lindsey and Mark are just recreating a tango Maks and Meryl did as part of their iconic dance assignment.

"Lindsey was NEVER going to live up to Meryl (a professional ice dancer) technically, but I actually really liked the tone of performance Lindsey/Mark chose to take given the nature of their partnership. Meryl/Maks were like a couple who felt passionately about each other but had issues/tension in their relationship. Lindsey/Mark felt like a long-time couple who were very comfortable with each other, but still had sparks (with Lindsey playing it flirtatiously in spots).",0.9725,91
Love this by Lindsey & Mark! It speaks volumes of their genuine beautiful friendship & amazing journey together! No pretense to garner votes simply putting it out there for us to appreciate & enjoy! This couple has made season 25 the exceptionally outstanding season it‚Äôs become!,0.9775,52

"They're not supposed to. I disagree as well. Meryl & Maks were a very unique partnership, as is every partnership, and this was everything a standard tango should be. I agree with Len, her frame could have been a little stronger, but that was an amazing performance. And Meryl is a professional ice dancer! Who dances with a partner for a living. Her level of experience is impossible to match. Lindsey & Mark interpreted M&M tango in their own way, paying homage to the original dance, as it should be.

Yup and it's also not the first time they've screwed up uploading a Lindsey video. Week 6 they didn't upload her AT along with the rest of the dances for that week and it took them several hours to realize it before they put all the other videos on private and then uploaded her video. I think the producers want Jordan to win so badly that Lindsey is an afterthought which is pathetic since she's just as good of a dancer as Jordan without half the training. I hope all of us Lindsey fans can rally to vote to get her and Mark that much deserved MBT.,-0.2479,111

they have worked so hard and they only receive 9 I think it is unfair.
for me they deserve to win.",0.6834,59
i agree :/,0.0258,3
"i completely disagree. Mark is creative but sometimes his creativity compromises the dance (butterfly quickstep) other times is really amazing (sci fi argentine tango). Maks might not be as creative but the way he dances is just so perfect (yeah i'm fangirl, sorry). Anyways, both Maks and Mark are different dancers in their own way. And i never said i wanted them (Mark and Lindsey) to dance the same choreography (I'm still mad at Witney for doing the same choreography as Juilianne). What i said was that their chemistry is different to that of Maks and Meryl and thus they could never surpass that iconic dance (it's iconic for a reason :P). Also, Lindsey is a great dancer but she lacked confidence in some steps and she didn't look really comfortable with what she was doing, she wasn't sharp as Meryl. I also felt that Mark's choreography was all over the place and didn't really fit the song (just some parts). Still let's agree to disagree, it's just one dance i didn't like (other than their Paso and their Quickstep).",0.9594,210
i feel like they took their time with the dance---with Meryl & Maks it came naturally & the chemistry was the best! I was really excited to see Lindsey & Mark to recreate it in their own way but it didn't have as much of the hype i thought it would have! :/ also annoying how everyone kept mentioning the SEXUAL chemistry Maks & Meryl had :/ damn,-0.8654,70
i still loved Meryl and Maks' tango better. I dont know it just didnt do it for me,0.7783,20
"i'm sorry for her but no one could ever match or even surpass Maks and Meryl's tango, they had a type of chemistry that you can't find in many of these new couples. i'm not saying that Mark and Lindsey have no chemistry but they have a different, more platonic kind of chemistry. still, i feel the judges overscored this dance, Lindsey can do better than this, i'd say it was one of her worse dances (including Paso Doble). hope she brings back her A game for the finals, i need some real competition (dance wise) for my team FishUponAStar.",-0.296,114
im so early yeahey,0.0,4
"like maks said you cant compare art to art but this was a beautiful tribute and routine! im tired of them being underscored!! mark is amazing with choreography and everything. hands down, they deserve the mirror ball !!",0.8914,44
loved it! way to go lindsey and mark!! üòÑ‚ù§,0.6981,13
meryl and maks had a sizzling chemistry that mark and lindsey didn't have in this tango...it was a different vibe  but at the end we have to somehow compare it to the original esp with someone who as good as Lindsey,0.7783,43
misskyliesue I'm so glad I'm not the only one who feels this way! Watching it actually made me feel uncomfortable.,0.3733,22

mlCH08 HC mlCH08 HC I guess I personally just don‚Äôt feel it in this dance with them. The feeling and chemistry I got when Meryl and Maks did it was a lot more powerful. I liked Lindsey‚Äôs contemporary performance more than this one last night,0.7698,53
ok I want to point this out. Obviously its not as perfect as Meryl but I was trying to say the dance was just as good as Meryl. And besides I give Lindsey credit because this was a difficult dance to pull off especially if this was Meryl‚Äôs dance.,0.5791,54
