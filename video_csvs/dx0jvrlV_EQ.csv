"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  
Then the Lord said, ""The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, ""Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way,"" They replied. And they said, ""This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them. "" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, ""Get your relatives out of here"", ""Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it."" (Genesis 19:12-13).

Do not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).

 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).

God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).

 Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).

The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).

Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).

They will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).

See Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.

Jesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).

Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).

Jesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).
Jesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).

Topheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  

Jesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).

This is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",-0.9972,1934

"Funny how their JEWS, 
But have 
no TEMPLE, 
no ARK of COVENANT, No PRIEST of Levi, 
No Animal blood sacrifice,
And no MESSIAH,

Yet they call themselves Jews, 
Because of a circumcision that men must get,
 that woman obviously do not get, 
yet the jew recognition must come thru the mother,  never understood that,

Go figure,, 

But lets not mention anything about JESUS,

Yet JESUS is like a Hanukkah 🎁, 
You get JESUS as the MESSIAH, yet he wasn't the 🎁 you wanted,
So you chucked him away,

If funny how the people who are supposed to recognize the MESSIAH, didn't,

But the uncircumcised gentiles did,,",-0.1779,128

I know the jews were afraid as they were not levites or all of aarons line but do realize through CHRIST ALL ARE QUALIFIED IN GOD so please use the 7 branch not the 9 branch one. The anointing after the miracle when GOD JESUS HOLY SPIRIT FATHER YHVH the hand nailed in grace upon the tree, HE who bore the curse upon himself that we all may have life HONOUR HIM GOD AMEN! Light 7 branches and AGAIN the 8th day as HE ROSE and is ALIVE AGAIN and made all clean removed the sin the abomination from the temple and anointed us all with HIS HOLY SPIRIT OF SALVATION AND REDEMPTION AMEN PRAISE JESUS GOD AMEN! 

The celebration of light was to mark HIS announcement of HIS BIRTH THAT WOULD BE, that is when the angel revealed to mary that she would bear a child, so you can count the days and realize he was born on the JEWISH HIGH HOLY DAYS as HE promised as he said to keep HIS appointed feast days, and john the baptist was born at the start of the new year in march during the feast days, they were the high priest family so you can use the schedule of the priest serving the two week cycle to count exactly. Hanukkah is for GOD not for judah maccabee! Do not use the 9 branch as jews were afraid that they could not touch the temple objects so they made and altered it to 9 do not do that do what GOD ordained and only use 7 branches as they did at the temple and then relight to show GOD did not let the oil run out HE renewed it through HIS miracle power revealing HIS GOODNESS AND BLESSING AND CLEANSING OF THE SIN AND RESTORATION AND HEALING OF THE PEOPLE AMEN!

The ONLY proper one is the 7 branch one do NOT use the 9 branch one ever! The 7 branches are to represent GOD! Either you elevate GOD as MOST HIGH GOD ABOVE ALL or you raise up JUDAH MACCABEE AS MOST HIGH AND OFFEND THE YHVH TRUE GOD JESUS! ONLY USE 7 Branches !  That represents GOD upon HIS THRONE upon the chariot, JESUS GOD upon the mercy seat the BLOOD OF THE PASSOVER LAMB OUR ATONEMENT IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES , the two cherubim at the ARC of the covenant and the 4 seraphim the wheels of the throne with 4 faces (that scientifically shows the 4 quantum super-positions of the cellular structure of nuclear energy and force of the universe GOD's power in physics in the universe at the macrocosm level and at a biochemical level in the microcosm of the cells of humans reflecting HIS GLORY all testifies to HIM YHVH JESUS the WORD the I AM!

Light 7 branches and AGAIN the 8th day as HE ROSE and is ALIVE AGAIN and made all clean removed the sin the abomination from the temple and anointed us all with HIS HOLY SPIRIT OF SALVATION AND REDEMPTION AMEN PRAISE JESUS GOD AMEN! 

The celebration of light was to mark HIS announcement of HIS BIRTH THAT WOULD BE, that is when the angel revealed to mary that she would bear a child, so you can count the days and realize he was born on the JEWISH HIGH HOLY DAYS as HE promised as he said to keep HIS appointed feast days, and john the baptist was born at the start of the new year in march during the feast days, they were the high priest family so you can use the schedule of the priest serving the two week cycle to count exactly. Hanukkah is for GOD not for judah maccabee! Do not use the 9 branch as jews were afraid that they could not touch the temple objects so they made and altered it to 9 do not do that do what GOD ordained and only use 7 branches as they did at the temple and then relight to show GOD did not let the oil run out HE renewed it through HIS miracle power revealing HIS GOODNESS AND BLESSING AND CLEANSING OF THE SIN AND RESTORATION AND HEALING OF THE PEOPLE AMEN!

The ONLY proper one is the 7 branch one do NOT use the 9 branch one ever! The 7 branches are to represent GOD! Either you elevate GOD as MOST HIGH GOD ABOVE ALL or you raise up JUDAH MACCABEE AS MOST HIGH AND OFFEND THE YHVH TRUE GOD JESUS! ONLY USE 7 Branches !  That represents GOD upon HIS THRONE upon the chariot, JESUS GOD upon the mercy seat the BLOOD OF THE PASSOVER LAMB OUR ATONEMENT IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES , the two cherubim at the ARC of the covenant and the 4 seraphim the wheels of the throne with 4 faces (that scientifically shows the 4 quantum super-positions of the cellular structure of nuclear energy and force of the universe GOD's power in physics in the universe at the macrocosm level and at a biochemical level in the microcosm of the cells of humans reflecting HIS GLORY all testifies to HIM YHVH JESUS the WORD the I AM! 

Use 7 branches as GOD ordained it to be! It represents HIM anything else is NOT kosher!

Yvonne Huffman no offense taken. G-d bless you!,-0.1759,10
"Yvonne Huffman, if you are up for a challenge,  read the NEW TESTAMENT in light of the OLD TESTAMENT. You may discover some really awesome things. The Torrah and G-d's law is for both the native born and the sojourner... that's you. G_d is unchanging... And here is another thing to ponder. If you claim to be a christian, you are a follower of Yeshua (Jesus). Did you know that your Messiah Jesus was a Jew. If you are a follower, then what are you following? He showed us how to keep G-d's commandments. He did not come to do away with the law, but to show us how to live it in love. Bless you as you journey!",0.9279,138

"sarah c it's a problem with Ashkenazi Jews, usually the more secular the more leftist. But clearly that's not always the case...  They Ignore that Communism has killed 100 million plus, the Quran has more anti-Semitic passages than Mein Kampf...  and do a terrible job of advocating. it's really a miracle we're not extinct, I've never seen a group have such a death wish... How many Jewish magazines have articles on Islamaphobia, or dangers of right-wing...  as Ben Shapiro has said, I've never faced anti-Semitism from the right.. (and it's not a phobia if they really want to kill you).",-0.9435,115
