"I believe there is true science and fake science, or scientism, a fake religion disguised as science. For the most part what the mass media teaches is false in order to hide the existence of God. I personally believe the Bible is 100% truth and that more recently with the release of television since the 1920's they have managed to lie to everyone, the created televisions exactly for the reason of mind control. There's patents and all kinds of proof of this info/facts. I haven't met Jesus my self, but I think he is God, he created everything because he was bored and we're here for his purpose. I've been doing lots of research to disprove or to further prove and from what I can find is that the book is all true. How would those men thousands of years ago be able to predict so many years ahead is beyond me, it's not for me to understand because I didn't create life, but the breather of life does understand, so I just have to have faith. While doing flat earth research I realized how lost most Christians are, actually most are fake Christians, they believe a lot of lies, but that's not to say their aren't real Christians out there. Also I started to understand the Bible better and learn so much awesome stuff along the way. I believed in the globe lie for 37 years, and once I learned this info it really improved my existence and my being, I don't get depressed anymore and I don't waste my time thinking about vain things like girls and cars and just so much shit that doesn't really matter. Plus I found out about things like how to see through lies, it really improved my being in that I'm not as trusting anymore, so I don't get screwed over like I used to get screwed before when I was too trusting or gullible because I didn't know any better. I'm still doing research but overall I would recommend everyone do research because the government can't be trusted and if they know the truth, which they do, but keep lying to us, there must be a reason, it's up to us to figure out what that is and also to stand up against the system, doing research just helps over all to stand up against this evil, all those bastards are players and they can't be trusted, they playing us like a fiddle, television is just mind control. I remember growing up I used to watch a lot of Disney and Nickelodeon and well that shit just fucked me up, and I didn't realize for so many years why my life was going the way it was going until I started to do the research and things started to add up. Luckily I didn't die before learning this stuff or I would have never known, like a lot of people who get brainwashed and never wake up from the ""american dream"". It's very liberating and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Along the way you may go back and forth and change your mind about stuff, like oh maybe hitler was a good guy, oh no he wasn't or so many other things, but then when you learn even more you end up being able to see what up much faster, just have to keep going and know that nothing is set in stone, facts are facts, and history has been rewritten, but those who re-wrote it aren't gods they just people and people make mistakes, so we just have to find their mistakes and dig around the haystack for that needle, truth is like a drug, once you find it you want it more and more.",0.9684,685

There is no real narrative to them now exept to get a few more women in the main rosters so the fans can get to know them before the Royal Rumble. 

You have a chance here, WWE, to make history. Take Absolution, add a member to make up for Paige and make it Paiges personal vehicle for revenge against Sasha for ending her in ring career. Make a point for Sasha to downplay her role in the injury and make HHH to publicly say that they don't blame Sasha. Don't make Sasha a heel, just make her say ""whoops, sorry"" and move on. Then Absolution and Paige, furious about how her injury has been treated and how Sasha gets away without a punishment for ending her career, will screw Sasha out of a RR win. Make them interfere with Sasha's non-title WM match (against someone, make a match). Build it slowly, make it last, make Absolution to make her career paranoid Hell where she never knows when they'll attack next (don't make the attacks weekly, just a few times a month), build it up to Summer Slam, even maybe Survivor Series (ok, you probably need to start it later for that).",-0.8372,268
