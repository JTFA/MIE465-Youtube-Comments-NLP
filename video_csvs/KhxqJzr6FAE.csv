"He's going to be a sensational Billy Flynn. I saw Chicago about five years ago on Broadway, and I have to say that I was shockingly underwhelmed about the production as a whole. Now I cannot speak about it before or since, but I would 100% go back to see it with Toddrick as Billy. Also -- the production of this video specifically is incredible. I feel like this should be the national commercial for Chicago on Broadway. Break a leg!",0.4926,91
