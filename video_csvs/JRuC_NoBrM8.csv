"Bible ref.
       1 Corinthians 6:9-11
9. Or do you not know that the UNrighteous will ""NOT"" inherit the kingdom of God ?

      Do not be deceived:

neither the sexually immoral,
nor fornicators,
nor idolaters,
nor adulterers,
nor homosexuals,
nor thieves,
nor sodomites,
nor covetious,
nor drunkards,
nor revilers, 
nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.

 
11.  And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified,  but you were justified in the name of our Lord ""Jesus"" and by the Spirit of God.


        All must REPENT from Sin to enter thy kingdom.

    Jesus Christ is the Only way to the father in heaven.",0.8662,134

"Both did back to back 1440s and 1260s. Difference was White did that 180 grab vs Hirano doing a backside air.

Shaun also hit his first 1440 straight out the gate and pulled it higher out of the pipe. Seems like you're just a typical Shaun hater that tries to sound unbiased.",0.128,56
"Carlos Ramirez sorry we disagree, and I'm a big patriot...
But that was just wrong, the tape doesn't lie ....
Japan smoked his ass.... You don't win gold pulling a few good moves, and then pull a 180tail grab...... Nope.
That's a disgrace to us, the snowboard community. Most people have no idea what they just saw anyway....
Well, we do........
That medal belongs to japan, as hard as it is to say...... Its called good sportsmanship....

"Empire Patriot Network it was close but Whites run was better, more cleaner more confidence. The score should have barely toped the Japan's score though. He deserves it. He ment no disrespect either you guys need to chill. Olympics are 1 sports event that cannot be fixed or cheated not like the xgames or another sport competition",-0.2478,62

Shaun White is a disgrace.  Go watch him after he won the gold medal.....he drags the American Flag on the ground.  Happy for him winning but somebody needs to explain to him how many men died for that flag so he could go to a free Olympic Games.,0.4588,53
Shaun white is a piece of shit he drug and walked on the American flag literally after winning the flag is more important than your skilled snowboarding dumb ass,-0.7102,29
"Shaun, You strengthened my pride in our country, but you dropped the end of our flag on the ground and dragged it behind you. What you did with the flag was total disrespect to our country. Treating the U.S. Flag with disrespect takes away from your glory. If nothing else, look up the proper treatment of The U.S. Flag. My forefathers & relatives fought for this country since atleast The American  Revolution and I'm sure they're turning over in their graves when they see the flag taken for granted or disrespected. Proper respect of our flag goes hand in hand with winning an Olympic Medal.",0.9575,120
Snow is on the ground it is not the ground so he did not drag it on the ground,0.1695,19
"Stop being tilted he dragged the flag. He was shocked and emotional, i wouldn't care about anything at that moment. Yea we shouldn't do it but people disrespect the flag every day. In the NFL holding the flag horizontal is illegal, tons of americans i bet break laws or codes of the flag. Leave the man alone. Its not the end of the world. Yes a lot of people fought for our flag. But come on, if you were this shocked and emotional winning a gold medal after a bad couple years, im sure you'd do the same. And dont give me the, "" no i wouldn't I know how to respect my flag"" yea well did you go through what he did to get that gold? Nah you didnt.  Bash me all you want, stay tilted.",-0.6386,155
TheSquadGamez your stupid,-0.5267,3
"Whatever, fair is fair.... He didn't earn the gold. Japan did. Poor kid got robbed...
You can't ever expect to win gold, when you pull a 180 tailgrab on your 3rd hit in the finals..... IT was bs.
But, he's all hyped up in the media, Mr drama boy.... 
You got a earn that medal...... And he didn't. No disrespect. Love the USA. 
Bad judging, look for yourself. Final run, 3rd hit. Beginner move......",-0.165,94

"Yeah man chill. If you think he doesn't know that you gotta be an idiot. He was in the moment after winning a golden medal after a redemption of not winning any medal from the last Olympics, plus considering this might be his last Olympics. He was psyched, notice how someone took it away from him just minute later",0.8979,64
Yes I am totally very protective of our American flag. When I seen him so overwhelmed today after winning the gold medal he's been so stressed out and trying to get everything to go I know he didn't have any intentions to harm our flag or to misuse it I think he's been very tired so please Let It Go let us just let it go. I know he goes back to this and feel really bad bad so let's just enjoy the rest of the Olympics okay go USA,0.0272,92
You people make me sick. Deal with it people. So what the flag was in the snow. 8 years ago Scotty logo held the flag upside down after he got 3rd. I don't see any of you raging on that video. By The way holding a flag upside down is against the law where having the flag touching the ground is not.,-0.7717,68
