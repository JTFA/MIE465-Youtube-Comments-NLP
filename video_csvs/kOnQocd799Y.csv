"I know exactly what it means... blah blah blah God from machine etc. Some people fail to make the connection that when an event happens that's a billion to one, it's precisely just that... an act of God. It's bad storytelling/writing to rely on astronomical odds to build/create/solve your story. An example would be 3 identical red cars appearing on the freeway at the same time, going to the same dinner that the one dudes chick works at, somehow figuring out that he's associated with the one random chick at the diner and virtually every second of this entire movie. Now of course, one every now and then is fine, but when your entire storyline is being solved by ex machina's (yes I cut off the dues, deal with it), it's dreadfully bad writing. One of the first things they teach people in film school is that logical sequencing doesn't matter... the reason being is, the general public is so stupid that they won't notice anyways. Movies have taken advantage of this to the nth degree... it's a slap in the face to their audience's intelligence the more that it's done. 
This movie isn't as cut and dry... in many ways it's not meant to be realistic, but just because a movie isn't meant to be realistic doesn't mean it should be able to keep pulling monkeys out of their ass to build/solve their storylines throughout, but of course they can and will completely rely on it, because they won't be called out for it anyways, with the exception of channels like CinemaSins who do. If more people started calling movies out for this shit, they would be incentivized to actually tell and create a logically concise story, even if it took place in an unrealistic realm.  And sure sometimes a film with dreadfully bad writing is entertaining and I can understand if there was a genre of films that did this (cartoons for example), but virtually every film takes the liberty of doing this to an extreme degree, thanks to zombie like audiences. Critiquing is not only a good exercise for the brain it helps steer the future of creativity.",-0.8684,405
"I loved this movie. My only problem was Baby and Debora‚Äôs realationship they knew each other a few days and she was willing to run away with him. Then she finds out he‚Äôs a criminal and has a lot of shit going on with the cops yet stays with him. Then drives him a good while till they get pulled over, honestly I don‚Äôt think any woman would be that loyal. And to top it off she waits at least 5 years to run away with Baby.",0.6124,99

I mean to be fair are the men any more dimensional in relation to the women they're with? Buddy and Darling had a good dynamic together but they were both pretty cookie cutter separately. Buddy's whole final arc was him seeking revenge because he thought Baby got Darling killed. Baby is obviously more complex but even still he's not all that much deeper than Debora.,0.5346,69
