Come to rewind with
Back to where we began
The autumn leaves have
Dropped to our knees
I don't think I can do it again




The winter winds can blow
But you and I both know
This doesn't have to end




I never wanted to ask for this
I never did, I never did




There must be some kind of reason
We keep changing through the seasons
It gets harder to believe in
The reasons why we stop
When we just break each other's hearts
All over
All over




I wish that I could stop
The ticking of this clock
I keep you right here with me




We'll never make it far
If we're just frozen hearts
When we're so close to spring




There must be some kind of reason
We keep changing through the seasons
It gets harder to believe in
The reasons why we stop
When we just break each other's hearts
All over
All over




It looks like (when will you see)
We're just lying
Now the time (what you and I could be)
I will say
Could make it right
We're just watching summertime
It's (our) time to say goodbye




There must be some kind of reason
We keep changing through the seasons
It gets harder to believe in
The reasons why we stop
When we just break each other's hearts
All over (There must be some kind of reason)
All over (We keep changing through the seasons)
All over (There must be some kind of reason)
All over (We keep changing through the seasons)
