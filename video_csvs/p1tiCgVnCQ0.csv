"Get Out had a brilliant lead up. But I think that they should have made it at least 30 minutes longer because the ending was all rushed and far too immediately revelatory by all of the characters. It could have chosen pathos for the hypnotised 'slaves' or had more horror but it didn't quite do either. As a result it feels more like a pilot for a Netflix series - which might have been a more interesting way of examining the history of ALL cultures coming to the land of the Native American and how the country's ideals are for freedom and equality and that there's rarely an immediate move to that status because people come with conceptions, not necessarily preconceptions, of what that can mean in a vast, diverse, country often being buillt up with a collection of European ideals. For instance, American embraced Greek classicism (which itself was popular in England in the 1700s but continued after then in America when England was embracing Victorian gothic revival. America's architecture was still reflecting a patrician form of social equality. England was becoming more individualistic, Romantic).",0.9701,203

So God is not against us, He is FOR us! 

The Lord came down from heaven in the Person of Jesus Christ to die, and 3 days later, rise again! He did this to redeem us back to Himself, so that we may go Home. 

Friends, Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him. (John 6:37 paraphrased) 

So don't let anyone stop you from approaching Jesus today!

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

All those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

All you need is mustard seed faith and sincere words from the heart. Jesus will hear you! I assure you!
