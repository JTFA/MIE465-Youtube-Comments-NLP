- ‚ÄéFrom the Mac (Best results)

*Natively* : Go to Settings/ Control Centre/ Add Screen recording. Now bring up the control centre where you will notice a inclusion of a new button. Click on it and, Viola !!! there you have it.

*Sideload ""EveryCord"" app* : 
- Head to this website - http://iemulators.com/
- Click on the ""APPS"" button.
- Scroll down, find ""EveryCord"", Download and install it. 
- ‚ÄéAnd provide necessary permissions. Head to Settings/ General/ Device Management/ Translaingrupp / Trust / Trust

"Sara please do not use Coinbase!
Buying your cryptos via coinbase is fine.... but you really should store them in a software wallet like EXODUS.

In software/hardware wallets you truly own and have full control of your cryptos like Bitcoin.
But using third party providers like Coinbase you basically are trusting your money to someone else and don't really own your cryptos. 
Meaning, in case Coinbase gets hacked or (...worst case) goes bankrupt all of your cryptos are lost, and all your hard earned money ist lost!!!
(Please google what happened to Mt. Gox some years ago)

Just saying this because cryptos are meant to be decentralised and giving a single entity the control over your cryptos is the complete opposite.

Don't want to sound rude... just pointing it out.
