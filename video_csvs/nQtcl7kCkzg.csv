"The 49ers play from Beathard to Goodwin (7:50ish) was so amazing. The 49ers hadn't won a single game at that point. We were like 0-7. Beathard was a third round draft pick that nobody expected to play when we started the season. Goodwin had dropped several important deep touchdown passes like this throughout the year. It seemed like he just couldn't catch those. Before this game, he had been awake all night as his wife was giving birth. Unfortunately, the baby didn't survive. There's a heartbreaking picture of the little guy clutching his daddy's finger. Goodwin was obviously heartbroken, in shock, and completely exhausted. He could have curled up in a ball and cried himself to sleep. Instead he went straight to the stadium and dressed for the game. He then proceeded to catch this incredible touchdown pass, at the end of which he fell to his knees in the end zone in honor of his son.",0.8502,178
