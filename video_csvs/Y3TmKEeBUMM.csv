"Holy shit! I agreed with Rocha on everything in this show and that never happens!

- Williams scoring Solo: Have Williams do all of it or none of it. What's the point of hiring a composer if you're going to hire another composer to compose the highlight? You're going to get a hodgepodge Frankenstein score like Justice League.

- People who save money to see one movie and are financially strapped, I empathize. They should get a quality film the first time around without repeat viewings. BUT.... if you're spending $5 on a fucking plastic cup half filled with ice and coffee, and $10 on a rice bowl at Panda Express, and you complain about movie tickets being too high when MoviePass is $10 a month, then you need to learn simple arithmetic and need to learn to budget.",0.7955,156

Re- Jodi Foster, I wouldn't say that superheroes have ruined movie audiences but they definitely have changed them. If there is a superhero (sci-fi) film I will 100% see it in the cinema. But if it's an independent or a rom com, I'll have to really want to see it in order to go to the cinema. There's nothing amazing about seeing ""Lady Bird"" on the big screen.

Overall, I liked the Last Jedi more than TFA as a film itself and that it did new story things but I respect people's ability to like, or dislike things. There is some truth to the point that people are taking their expectations, fans theories and head canon into TLJ impacting their first viewing whether people want to admit it to themselves, or not. People are responsible for their own thoughts not others, you cannot blame the studio, or the cinemas for what you personally believe.

"I just want to thank Kristian and Perri for sticking up for the little guy who's isn't as rich as Mr. Rocha.

I didn't like it at all, and I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I still remember seeing the first one with my dad as a young boy.  But this was the first Star Wars movie I ever considered walking out of.  It actually made me appreciate the prequels more, so not all bad news I suppose.  So no, Rocha, I will not be going back to pay more money to see it just to maybe like it better.

"I think people say you would like the last jedi better if you saw it again is because of the clear expectations that a lot of people had going in.

You shouldn't have to see a movie twise to get it or like it, but it kinda seems like we ruin movies for ourselves with the hype and precpncieved notions we have and That's not something the creator can do anything about.",0.4215,100
"I understand change and growth are good and necessary, but please just leave Buy or Sell as it was",0.6597,20
"I understand, but Jodie Foster does have a valid point.  Movies today like Deadpool and GOTG to even Last Jedi have no substance compared to a simple film like ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri "" which exponentially was a much better film in so many ways!  Many of us want more serious and mature driven directors to continue making these type of films because some of us value substance in our movies.  And not childish action-hero driven films like Deadpool, GOTG, Thor 3 to Wonder Women among several others.",0.9647,98
"I'm mostly on Jodies side... but also on your commentators side... the real problem, is in a nutshell we have something like a 70/30 split between garbage and quality in superhero films (and blockbusters generally).  The gamble isn't worth it for an A-lister such as she is.  But the point about alternative platforms such as House of Cards on Amazon/Flix (yeah shoot me now IDGAF) is so worth bringing up - the small bijou art-housey choice is there for her, so the overall 'bitch' she has you covered well.

Many working Americans never recovered after 2008 and more still are struggling and angry! Talk like that does not help! They are angry and scared as their health care is threatened, net neutrality has been repealed. The internet is not a luxury anymore, it was classified as a utility under net neutrality for a reason. More and more having reliable/affordable internet access is necessary for finding and APPLYING for a job/pre screening for jobs/school/accessing government and community services including health! I'm pretty sure I've seen you on The Young Turks in the past? You know better! If the Left/Progressive don't get their heads out of their asses Trump, or someone worse!!! could win for 2020!

Historically, when facing economic insecurity people seek out escapism in entertainment and food/alcohol etc in greeter numbers. Also, depending on resources/living arrangements, eating fast food/junk IS too often the more affordable. Greater numbers of WORKING families are relying on food banks and other helps. I don't think you should have to but look up ""bread & circuses"" to remind yourself what that term means and indicates. The fact that more money is  spent on eating out and entertainment is actually a very worrying sign/proof that all is not well. Let's learn from history people, 'cause it also shows us what happens when the cries of the people are ignored by the elite and their supporters for too long (revolution time!!!)",-0.7309,316
Rocha's right if you can't afford coffee or to see a movie twice? Steal coffee and bootleg the movie with Kodi. Problem solved.,-0.5859,26

"While Jodie Foster is not entirely wrong, we have movies like X-Men, which use the presence of powers to depict how humanity would react in the face of something new and unknown, having wonderful parallels to human prejudice throughout history and the different reactions from the persecuted (Professor X vs Magneto). Captain America: Civil War involved people with superpowers duking it out, but used the presence of these superpowers to bring up the question of security vs liberty that we face today. The Dark Knight trilogy gets into the nature of good vs evil and the importance of symbols. Deadpool is a nice cultural satire of both the genre and society in general. Comic book movies allow people to see these real world problems while also experiencing something fun and entertaining.",0.9598,143

The fact that some people use TLJ financial success of TLJ to debate the quality of the film is just as bad as saying the movie sucks because it made less than TFA. None of that matters.

Wow! Rocha is sitting in his ivory tower and towing the line of production houses. God!,0.7568,19
"Wow! What is wrong with Rocha? Personally I already know how I feel about a movie after one viewing. Time is more important to me than money. If I felt the urge to see TLJ again, I would have. But for me, I felt that I would get more enjoyment from spending the time and money I had reserved for multiple viewings of TLJ on/with my daughter, playing video games, spending quality time with the wife, etc. For me I can think of plenty of things I could do with my time and money then to see TLJ multiple times just to see if I am crazy for not liking it. Movies that I see multiple times in a theater are reserved for movies that I am excited to dissect, research, and enjoy.  Not for movies that I did not like.

Anyway, I came here after watching a healthy Jedi Council discussion on Star Wars and thought that I was going to get more of that here... nope more of the same. Check it guys, real talk. No one cares if you liked TLJ, I am happy for those who found such enjoyment in it. We just don‚Äôt appreciate the hypocrisy from people who like the film. Do you know how many people tried to convince me to like to TLJ? You guys say that it is wrong to try to make people hate the movie - it is also wrong to try and make people like it.",0.8286,278

Maybe box style. Then when your 2 point, 3.point and 5 point come up, the box opens and the question appears. Just a thought. Spectacular was amazing by the way!!!",0.9131,117
