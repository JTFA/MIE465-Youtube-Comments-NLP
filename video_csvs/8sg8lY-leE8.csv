@Its Sharlele  She was ordered to leave by the school board (the authority figures in this meeting who are also her superiors) because she was being a loudmouth moron. She refused to leave so a security officer was called to the scene and she still refused. Resisting an officer is against the law especially when you've already been ordered by a superior to leave an area. Therefore he was allowed to remove her by force. If a retard chooses to be a criminal by resisting & refusing to move (which is what I would expect from a little kid) then what is the officer supposed to do? Get on his knees and beg her to leave? She acted like an immature prick and got what she deserved. Next time she'll learn to obey those who are above her.,-0.8819,150

If someone is in a position of authority then they are in control of workers who are below their position. You really think that someone who acts like a loudmouth kid shouldn't be ordered to leave by their superior? And you don't think a loudmouth moron who's refusing to leave shouldn't be removed by force by an officer of the law? Smh It's retards like you that usually end up having a criminal record or being fired from numerous workplaces because you have an immature mindset. You're above the law and the authority figures that are in a position to tell you what to do. Grow up, learn to respect authority and shut the fuck up.

"And yeah, sadly asking questions or anything can get you arrested. I've got a contributing to a minor from when I was 21 for no reason. The cop just started accusing me while holding a tape recorder and kept saying it over and over again and then arrested me for it and there were no minors around!!!!!! And if you wonder why I'd plead guilty, it's because in court cops don't lie. (They do in reality, but this is court land. You can't claim the cop is lying, you get max. You always plead guilty in court, because if you don't and they charge you guilty anyway. Even if you're innocent and it's your own job to prove your innocense and the only evidence is my word against a cops and I can't afford a lawyer. So my lawyer managed to get me a grand misdemeanor contributing to minors with no jail time or fines. I just had to say guilty. So I could say guilty and go home, or say not guilty and be put in jail. I chose the one that got me home, that's why I've always pleaded guilty of everything on my record.
      So, the best advice is avoid police at all costs. If you come across one, don't look him in the eye. Keep walking. Don't say anything, they are easily provoked. think about it. This person willingly took a position of literal power with guns. Who wants that? You don't want someone who wants that to be looking or thinking about you at all. I had a kid from high school become a cop and I couldn't go anywhere without him harassing me or throwing me in jail. It got so bad I had a different cop take me in and tell me to leave town as soon as I'm able or things will get worse. I did just that and never had to deal with jail and the police again. Just the record that asshole gave me from his constant harassment. I wish it would show who picked me up everytime. It was a fucking risk to go shopping or go to burger king or visit a friend. I think they rotate cops around now to try to stop them from picking on the same people over and over again. I made the mistake of going to the same school with an asshole and can't find work in the field I'm best at because of it.",-0.9868,454

"As a Leo, there are times when we must use our discretion to accomplish the task at had. Obviously the teacher was agitated and emotionally charged, especially when she was getting kicked.  In what we could see/hear, she was reluctantly doing what she was asked to do. Even though she was asked several times that she needed to vacate, she did finally do what the officer instructed without causing too much of a disruption. As far as what took place in the hallway, we can only speculate due to not seeing what occurred. I will infer from the conversation by the patrol car that she was still trying to ask questions and probably kept pausing while walking. Either way, if this was the case, she is no longer a ""disruption"" to the meeting and the officer could/should have tried to deescilate the situation be explain to her why she was getting removed and also listened to her concerns. Does he HAVE TO??. No, he does not,, but as an officer, it's what we do. 
Now, as far as getting removed in the first place... It appeared to be an open forum with teachers and administration. The woman had the courage to stand and speak, in a polite and concise way that did not warrant her expulsion. The administration wanted to silence her and booting her out was the way to do it.  The administration was within their rights to ask her to leave, but it shows they're scared of what was coming out of her mouth. The officer, understanding that she is entitled to her 1st amendment and being removed for exercising it ( given that she was not really causing a scene or being boisterous when she addressed the crowd) should have made more of an effort to deescalate the situation and been more understanding.  Now, this is assuming the officer was inside the room and know what we know.. Let's also assume he was not in the room at the time of this incident and was made aware by one of the administrative goons that she was causing a disturbance.. Now I can see where he would possibly handle the situation as he did. By playing devils advocate I personally, am not taking sides. Being that I do this for a living, I will say that people often modal morning quarterback everything police do after the fact. But if one takes the time to examine the facts, perspective and perceptions dictate the scenario. The facts are basically the teacher opened her mouth and elicited a really good point, admin did not like this so they called for a cop ( given the slow response time, I'm going to assume he was not in the room.) cop orders her to leave, which is a lawful order even if one does not agree with it, and the teacher is reluctant at first to do so.  There is a time and a place for being a big bad cop who lays down the law,,, this, in my opinion, was not that time. I can't comment on what led to him putting her in cuffs, but I'm pretty sure she did resist and was taken to the ground. Could it have been avoided? Yes,mom course.. But until all facts are clear, I will wait to declare a winner.  The teacher appears to be brave, and perhaps a bit too brazen.. But as long as she is not a direct threat to anyone's safety, I would be reluctant to make the arrest. Just my two cents.",0.8901,668

"For ig(noble)man1291: I hope that you didn't/don't/won't wear any uniform (other than an inmate one) because from your postings I can infer that you are a narrow-minded guy who cannot put up to the fact that all of a sudden you became ""important"" by getting a little administrative or legal power. The power that was bestowed upon someone doesn't make that one smarter or intellectually superior to others. It just gives you the legal cover to enforce the law, but first you need to understand the spirit of the law. Many idiots who got power, like this imbecile in uniform, misinterpret or misconstrue the law. This lady was rightly outraged by the fact that this selfish son of a bitch superintendent was getting a VERY CONSISTENT raise (30 to 40,000 $ is a yearly salary for a teacher), while the rest of the teacher didn't get any raise (not even a small one of a few hundreds bucks) in a decade, and, due to the lack of funds, the number of students in classrooms increased from 20 to 29, which makes the teaching process less efficient. The issues raised by this lady were very pertinent and were against the superintendent getting a raise. She was not violent, but she was naturally outraged a second time, when she was handcuffed by the idiot just for presenting her objections against the raise. The injustice and abuse of power done to her made her ""yell and scream"". It's a natural reaction to injustice that normal people (I said normal people, therefore, you,  ig(noble)man1291, are not included in this crowd...) have when an injustice is committed.    Watch the movie ""...And Justice For All"", the speech scene, where the actor Al Pacino, playing the rapist defence counsellor, gives an anthological performance when he becomes ""hysterical"" and gets ""out of order"" because of the injustice that was going to happen.     Way too many idiots (the Security Officer), selfish narcissists (the superintendent) and unscrupulous immoral bastards (the school board members) get the power nowadays and the rest of the people don't have even the courage to protest or object against them. When those few who are not coward and have the courage to take a stand against the corrupts, they are arrested...and there are even greater idiots, like ig(noble)man1291, who think that this is normal.",-0.989,470

"Let's face it, though. We never see exactly what happened when this woman got arrested, and we never see who directed the officer to escort her out. The school board may have had specific policies that were being maintained, and while I agree that they were making some bad decisions, there is a major possibility that she was escorted out because of real reasons instead of her being a nuisance. Further, she was charged with something similar to disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, not asking a question that they don't like. So since we never see the arrest, it is likely that he arrested her only after she repeatedly resisted she defied what he was told he needed to have her do. Before this, he was never aggressive, and afterward, he had to use force, because it was an arrest, but maintained a minimum amount of force to accomplish what needed to be done. He never swore at her, shoved her, hit her, and it is sometimes necessary to force someone on the ground if they are resisting an arrest, which in the case I've presented would be justified. Following, he told her not that she was being ridiculous or stupid or anything harmful, but instead that ""You were refusing to do what I was trying to tell you to do, I was only telling you what I had to because (whatever circumstances are present that we don't see), and this is the situation we're in,"" proceeding to tell her ""You need to calm down"", which in the scenario I'm presenting would not be him being corrupt, but him trying to control the situation and calm everything as best he can. He proceeded to call back up not because of the five-foot-tall teacher he had arrested, but instead because he had a crowd of angry people around him and he was the only cop there. He called backup for his own safety.",-0.8352,362

"Who are all the old farts sitting around that table like a barrier to the school board and especially the one who spouted off it wasn't question time, just comments to the second woman's question about Puyau's performance evaluation? I would have said at that point that my question was rhetorical and therefore valid in the 'comment' section of their little meeting because no one was ever going to answer that, anyway. This is everything that is wrong with our education system structure. Educators are supposed to foster reasoned debate with their students. That should but obviously does not stretch to the school board level in this parish.",-0.2542,117
