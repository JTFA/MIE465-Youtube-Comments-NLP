"American college applications are so intense! I feel like here in Canada it's pretty lax. The application doesn't ask about your hobbies and activities. It's literally your name.

Film & Media Studies is pretty different than a Film degree that’s why lol. Any major with the word “studies” after it requires you to analyze and write papers rather than produce content. A Film degree would be more production based. Students are required to film and submit pieces. Hope this clears up the confusion.,0.795,64
"Fit and match trump grades and scores. This was something taught to me over and over as a McNair scholar in undergrad, I wish I had known this in high school but as a first generation student with no family experiences about university, I didn't learn any of this until after.

I recommend to everyone to visit the campuses you want to attend. Email admissions or student life and ask for information about where you can stay, connect with students and ask to sleep on their couch if you can't afford a hotel, it shows that you're greatly interested in their school. Email professors in your fields of interest and make those connections, those can also help you get in, especially in graduate school.",0.9436,135

"I honestly loved this video so thank you sososososo much for sharing both of your experiences with us. I'm truly thankful!

I really hope you read this...
I have a question and a request if it's okay.

My question is: did you of you only take a bachelors degree or did you also take a masters degree? I often hear people talking about university, but they never really talk about if they only took a bachelors degree or if they also took the masters degree. Also, if you only took the bachelor or both, could you maybe explain why you decided only to take the bachelor or taking both and if it effectet anything when applying for work?

My request is if you could please make a video with Claudine about your exchange experience: where did you travel to, why and how it was?  How did you pick your exchange university? :)

Sorry for this really long comment. I don't comment on videos that often, but I'm really curious and I see both of you as people I can learn from.

Have a wonderful day or night.  :))",0.9826,208

"I love that yall decided to make this video!! I'm currently in college and I feel like what yall are saying is so true!! Another obstacle in college for me though, and many other people experience this as well, is being a transfer student. I went to a local college my freshman year and was actually able to stay home (that also left me out of a lot of freshman year experiences). Then in my sophmore year I transfered to a college on the other side of my state. To most people that doesn't seem far, but I'm from Texas. This left me feeling a little odd and out of place and it's been slightly harder for me to make new friends because it seemed like I was just getting to know people at my old school and now I have to start all over again. Its much harder now because not only do I not know anyone that goes to this school, but I moved here not knowing anyone in a 100 mile radius. I feel very alone, and that's not something that I've ever felt before. It's been really hard but I'm working on putting myself out there and doing things that could help me meet new people.",0.9136,229

"I'm graduating this summer~ I know not everyone takes a program that they don't really connect to, all I can say is if you really want to get a job in your major, go out there and network yourself. Attend every single networking/job fairs/info session, that way you'll easily land a job right after or even while still studying. And join clubs that will look good on your resume. These are things I never did or rarely did and now I'm struggling landing a job when everyone in my class are already set after grad. Goodluck !",0.6793,109

I still haven't taken the SATs and my GPA is a 2.5.. I'm honestly really scared of not getting accepted to my dream universities because I don't see myself fitting anywhere else. I really regret not caring about my grades freshman and sophomore, at that time I didn't really know anything about colleges nor did they interest me. I now realize that they do matter and that I was just a naive little girl.. I hope I can better myself before the end of senior year so I can at least feel satisfied with my hard work.

Post grad here! Oh man I can totally relate to the sadness in the first semester of college. I decided to stay home and go to a commuter university to save money and whatnot and all of my close friends went somewhere else and seeing all of their activities on facebook really got me down. I high recommend stepping back from it all and just enjoying your time in the university that you choose. I think I deactivated my facebook for a month or so because I just kept comparing my college experience to my friends' experiences. I would come back on to facebook after my break and if I found myself falling back into sadness or comparing too much again I would deactivate my facebook once more. I met and re-met so many people in college. It's a fun time so good luck to anyone going in or who is already in!,0.9599,162

"That's so interesting!! I had to decide my major before applying and here it's like once you're in, you have the exact classes you have to take (even tho you won't get a spon in every class bc it's like 250 students who want the spot and 25 spots per class - which makes you loose a hella lot of time - so 1 year every class you can't get into -.-) ... And when you are one year into uni you can't change. Either you finish, or you have to quit and apply for a different major and do everything all over again. :D Sucky system :D Most majors should take you 6 semesters to finish. Most people need at least double the amount of time, if not longer. :D I hate it & I wish they had told us before we started haha :D :D :D :D",0.9916,162

"This is so cute and inspiring! Love you two! Thanks for sharing your thoughts, I just ended university (well I still have classes twice a week so I have this weird half-student/half-employed status even though I graduated) but I think you covered the most important things: doing what seems honest in the moment, being yourself, and going out there (reaching out to people, trying new things,... leaving your room!). I learned a lot about myself in uni. I connected with Claudine a lot because I identified myself as ""the best student"" in secondary school and once I got accepted in ""prestigious"" higher education systems, I realized I wasn't so special... I was even pretty average in that community. It took me a few years and some hard failures to realize that I am not how well I do in academics and to figure out who I was and what I wanted in life. And then you take it one step at a time to achieve what you want to achieve. Even if you don't seem good enough, perseverance goes a long way. Persevere and hang in there but if it gets unbearable, know when to be flexible and accept change. This is still true even after graduating haha! Sometimes, I still struggle with whether I made the right career choice or not XD But hey! Life changes and we change too. So lets see where it takes us!",0.9717,274
This is so practical and relatable!!! Love you guyss 🧡🧡🧡,0.7249,15
"This is such an inspiring video. Love you two so so much. This is possibly the best college advice video I’ve come across so far, wish this video was released in my high school days. Looking back from now after doing a postgrad course, the only thing I regret is I should have studied way much harder back in high school. I was so lazy back then. But to be honest, if I did study hard, I might not step into the industry I’m working in right now which I decided to do a related master course in the sophomore year and I very much enjoy my postgrad year. That has become the best year of my life. So, like Claudine’s boss-ass Korean lady said, stay true to yourself at that moment and that will create the best of you. ❤️",0.9843,162
This is the best video I’ve seen i think ever cause I relate so much to some situations you were in as a law graduate I thought I knew what I want and i had everything planned but life took a troll on that sometimes i feel lost and i want to start over and doubting myself but i truly believe one day none of this will matter and everything will turn out fine cause the universe has everything planned,0.5187,82
This video helped me lose some of my stress a little more,-0.6705,12
"This video is so heartwarming, I feel like just talking with a friend. I'm going to graduate college this year and your words is all I needed. I love you guys, I love Claudine ❤",0.9604,39

"This video is what I need. I’m a senior that is graduating in May. I’m going to college, but I still don’t know what I’m doing. I want to make new friends, be more active, but still working hard. I’m just scared that I will fail.",-0.1557,64
"This video made me so nostalgic.  I graduated in 2015 and college was such a good experience for me, I relate to what you said.  Also Claudine seems like a great person to have long, deep conversations with. 😊",0.8591,44
"This video makes me very sad and sentimental especially about the friends part because I'm away from my friends and from home. And my college colleagues who I thought were my friends are starting to feel like they're not. And that makes me sad. Many times I think about it and I think ""did I make the right decision of coming here? Is this all even worth it?"" The process itself is really hard. And when she said like friends forever. That hit me because I only have one good close friend and she's across the globe since I'm studying abroad and the rest are just people that I pass time with. It makes me sad because i feel like I'm not growing into what I wanted to be.",0.9551,140
This video really let me breathe... thank you so much for the help. With the advice I will improve my essays a lot.,0.7964,26

"This was such a good video and you two's advice was just so real and reassuring. Both of u seem like the most genuine people, so laid back and just doing what makes u happy. I feel like I'm lost with what I want to do vs what I feel others want me to do and it's really hard. I Guess I have to learn how to take things one step at a time and maybe I'll find where im meant to be too.",0.9036,89

"Why do people always call themselves (other country) American. For people like my grandmother and my great grandma, or my wife's side of the family... it makes sense. But that's only because they are legally citizens of both China and the US, or for my family Korea, and Ireland. If you were born here, your nationality is American. Not African American, Irish American, or Korean American. Just American. It is a reference to your national origin and literally nothing more.",0.7906,96
