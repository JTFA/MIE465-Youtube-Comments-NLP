"I was surprised. I didn't watch it live but heard it was really bad. I enjoyed it. Thought it was clever. He actually sang, and we'll. Should have had some costume changes for the genre/stage changes. Also felt like it was weird to see him dancing on other women since he is married, and has a baby. Otherwise really, really cool.",0.8789,74

"I've been a fan of Justin's since I was in elementary school, and while I never watch the Super Bowl, I always tune in just for half time.  Having seen this man in concert live and watching this, I feel like this was a cool performance spanning the hits he's made as a solo artist in his career, however I feel like it was a lackluster performance.  The dance moves seemed lazy...almost like I would imagine him performing in rehearsal or sound check.  Was this the worst half time show?  No, but it was far from the best and any saying this is the best show they've seen is lying.  His 2001 performance with *Nsync was much better, Michal Jackson's performance was MUCH better, Madonna's performance was MUCH better, Beyonce's performance was better...I can go on",0.9677,154

"The Prince tribute was very nice! The Tennessee Kids were great as usual. J.T. always brings it!!! But for me there seemed to be too many, too casually dressed dancers surrounding him - too much going on, and distracting from the star.
