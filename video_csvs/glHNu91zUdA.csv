"BS.  First of all,  there are many types of NOx, and in reality they are almost all natural fertilizer for plants, and totally harmless to humans.  There are a few types of NOx that have some dangerous aspect, but they break down in minutes.  The proof is obvious, since anyone who has ever tried to commit suicide with diesel exhaust has failed.  Diesel exhaust from a turbo charged engine is almost completely harmless.  You get about 100 times the exposure of NOx by going to an in door shooting range.   All the diesel cars the world put out an insignificant amount of emissions compared to trucks, and actually the single larges source of NOx is agriculture, that deliberately over fertilizes with ammonia products.
The real reason US can manufacturers produced this witch hunt against VW is because US car makers have never been able to succeed at making a good, small diesel engine.  They have tried dozens of times and always failed.  So they used false claims to illegally discriminate against vehicles that were simply too clean and too efficient, getting over 56 mpg.
There is absolutely no way an vehicle getting 56 mpg can possibly pollute more than a US made SUV getting more like 12 mpg.  The whole thing is a total fraud.  Like the way they claim VW produces ""AS MUCH AS 40 TIMES THE ALLOWED AMOUNT OF NOX"".  Well of course a vehicle is going to temporarily produce huge amounts of NOx when burning out the residue in the particulate filter.  It is only the total emissions that count, and if you measured the TOTAL amount of any US vehicles, instead of the deceitful PARTS PER MILLION, than no US made vehicle would pass, and VW would.",-0.9581,321

"Hacks509 “nobody bats an eye”... care to back that up with data? There’s plenty of complaints online, and I believe Maryland was the first state to take legislative action and “rolling coal” is now an enforceable offense.

And it’s not even the aftermarket that’s the problem. Plenty of tuned trucks with emissions equipment deleted that are tuned to run as cleanly as possible. I have a deleted truck because the heat of the DPF is a serious fire hazard with all the tall dry grasses on my acreage in summer (the USFS tested this for their wild land fire trucks when DPFs were first mandated). But I run a very clean tune. You can’t make my truck blow clouds of soot. If you give it a bootfull of throttle all at once (which you shouldn’t do in a diesel anyway, you want to feed it in as RPMs climb), you can get a barely visible puff of soot, but you can still see through it (not an opaque cloud), and it’s momentary until RPMs pick up to use the fuel.

The coal rollers are a bunch of ingrates with no respect for others, and the rest of us despise them. You should see the responses on diesel forums like DieselPlace. Some punk gets on there and asks how to tune his truck to roll coal? He gets lambasted by the rest of us. The DPF was a major risk factor for wildfire in my circumstances. Doesn’t mean I don’t care about the welfare of others... quite the opposite, I don’t want fire on my property to endanger my neighbors.

Anyway... to claim nobody bats an eye at the coal rollers is simply false. Legislators are already and have in some cases taken direct action, but perhaps more importantly within the diesel truck community itself there is significant pushback against that stupidity, and it’s been getting stronger.",0.6701,375

"Horrendous company. Doesn’t surprise me that they’d cheat and risk the health of animals and people to do it. I had a 2013 Passat TDI. Initially, it was a decent car. Fun to drive, got great mileage obviously. But then the headlight broke. VW blamed owners closing the hood too hard and issued a recall. Then the autodimming mirror broke. Then the back door handle stopped working. Then it just plain came off one day. Then the DEF heater failed and VW wouldn’t replace the component because it wasn’t covered under the emissions system warranty. How is a diesel exhaust fluid heater, crucial for operating the car in cold climates, not part of the emissions system? Then the heater stopped working on the passenger side because the heater core was clogged with particles from the crappy aluminum used for the radiator. So I got rid of the car. Now, after 3 attempts and over a year of waiting, VW has still failed to submit the paperwork to transfer ownership of the car from me to them. As a result, the DMV keeps sending me registration bills for a car I don’t have. So I’m getting penalized and threatened with legal action from the state for owning an unregistered car. So yeah.

What I really want to know is:  Why couldn't VW fix the cars by reprogramming them?  Was there something proposed that was rejected by the US government?  Every diesel VW owner that I have spoken with absolutely loves their VW.  I have personally seen brand new diesel VWs being destroyed at a scrapyard and it is as upsetting as hearing about some monkeys being used in a science experiment.  These monkeys honestly got off easy.,0.3063,81
"What REALLY baffles me is what was going through the head of the marketing department who thought this monkey experiment was a good idea. I mean, imagine if they HADN'T had Dieselgate happen and all that, what were they going to do? How did they imagine it would go?

VW: ""Hello, consumers of the world! To prove to you our cars are quite clean, we have gassed some monkeys with a Beetle and an old Ford, while they were watching cartoons!""

Consumers: ""Oh yes, wow, that is really very ethical of you! Let us all buy clean Volkswagens now! Thank you for gassing these monkeys! Boo on you, Ford, for not gassing any monkeys while developing your trucks! Vielen danke, Volkswagen! Underbar!""",0.9729,149
"What has not been explained is Who or What entity and  for what reason commissioned the West Virginia University study in the first place. Those curious enough can find the information easily. This study did confirm my suspicion that real world testing is not and was never considered a viable certification test because procedure had too many variables. CARB and EPA knew this but could NEVER admit this. Shame CARB and EPA and Shame VW.
Here is hoping real world certification testing becomes the new normal.",-0.6625,92

"Whilst this was a great video... Volkswagen sell a tiny percentage of their cars to the USA, with the vast majority staying in the EU. Gtfo thinking it was too avoid US laws. It was all about EU regulations not the EPA. 
Also, a fair number of other manufacturers also did the same, not saying that makes it okay, but you seem to suggest you care about fair journalism and equality... Show it please?",0.9246,84

"Wow, I just lost a lot of respect for EE. I had hoped you wouldn't just be rehashing the incredibly biased reporting around this issue, but I guess I had too high expectations.

You deliberately failed to mention that the gas was diluted to levels well below harmful. The research also wasn't carried out by VW, but by Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute of new mexico  This is very disingenuous, and its baffling to me how you be okay with misleading so many people into thinking VW ""gassed"" monkeys.",-0.2724,98

"Wow.  I'm feeling a lot of USA pride. While we don't make many products anymore, a European company chose us for the animal abuse and testing portion of their scheme.  USA USA   That is so much better than the German option of putting actual paid human volunteers that could give qualified feedback and voluntarily remove themselves from the test or put on a mask upon discomfort not to mention that they probably all do worse things to themselves than this test ever could like smoking.  No...lets needlessly abuse some non-volunteer innocent creatures that get no benefit as an alternative.",0.0717,107

"You simply cannot have economy, emissions, and performance all at once from ANY internal combustion engine. That's like the triangle of cheap, quick, good quality. You get to pick 2, as weighting any one higher takes away from the others.

"while this test is absolutely ridiclious, the scientific knowledge of the effects of NOx on greater mamals phisiology is very poor. there should have been extensive studies funded by government organizations (looking at you european commission) on the subject of how much NOx has what effects, before defining limit values. cleaning exhaust gas with urea injection will lower NOx emissions while raising ammonia emissions. ammonia is another raspiratory irritant gas which scientific evidence is even poorer but there are yet no emission limits for.",-0.7577,92
