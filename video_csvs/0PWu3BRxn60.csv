WTF happened here?  Massive pause before 2nd stage confirmation and it just feels like no-one is sure it actually worked (later reports say it didn't) then it takes like 2 mins from re-entry to landing? C'mon no amount of thrust is gonna slow down a rocket falling that quick to land like it did.  It was at night to hide shit and this is just unbelievable...in the worst way.

"You can totally hear his tone has changed when he comes back from the long pause at 17:25 to confirm the fairing had separated, he almost sounds out of breath; obviously something in the data feed indicated there was already something wrong at this point. My theory is the fairing didn't separate cleanly and bumped/damaged the Zuma payload when it separated, ultimately causing the satellite to not deploy correctly or to not deploy at all for that matter. If this occurred (fairing hitting the payload) it could have possibly offset the center of gravity for the second stage causing it to plunge off course and burn up in the atmosphere. It's a shame that this mission is highly classified and we might not know the real cause or damage for weeks or even years.",-0.8519,145
