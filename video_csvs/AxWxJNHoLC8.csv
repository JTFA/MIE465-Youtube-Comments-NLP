"As someone who has schizophrenia (schizoaffective disorder, more specifically), I'd like to say 2 things:
1. Not all schizophrenics suffer the same symptoms. Schizophrenia is a general term meaning a psychosis where perception is distorted from reality, and can include auditory hallucinations, but also visual hallucinations, delusions, speech difficulties, incoherent thoughts, mood swings, anxiety, and paranoia, among others. Saying that schizophrenia is just hearing mean voices is not only misleading, but disregards those who suffer from other forms of schizophrenia, like catatonic or disorganized schizophrenia. (The one they try to replicate in the video is paranoid schizophrenia.)
2. Having schizophrenia is not just something you ""try"" for a few hours - its a lifelong struggle. The concept of the headset by its very usage means that the participant is aware that the voices are false, and that undermines the terrifying truth that schizophrenics have difficulty telling what's real and what doesn't. Simulating schizophrenia in this pseudo-challenge video format is defunct by default, and other avenues, like movies and videogames especially, are much more impactful and authentic.",-0.974,209

"I had schuzotypal personality disorder....then in 2015 it developed into full blown schizophrenia.  I am have a mild form of Tourette Syndrome......and wait for it....I have TMAU. I stay indoors for weeks at a time, the moment I step out that TMAU  odor has everybody covering their noses from as far back as 50 yards away. 

Plus I live in Nigeria, a very conservative and ignorant society.   As a result I am fighting for my life.    I have not been with my family for give years, I am in isolation because of this. I have no friend, no real friend, few that stick around just come for my money then flee. 

As of this writing I am in a daily battle against witchcraft because my friends and enemies alike accuse me of being a Satanist and ritualist because of my odd behaviour.  They do not understand. They gather in public places to talk about me? Laugh about me, accuse me of witchcraft. 

So it happens those who accuse me of witchcraft accuse me of bewitching them. I refuse to go to church because of the smell. They see my avoidance of church service and my isolation as further proof that I am a Satanist, a ritualist. So they wage war against me. They send demons to torment me. They came to my house and stole my car keys? Cloths and several other personal effects. I later realised they needed my personal item to bewitch me.

So now every where I go I have crows and other birds hovering around. At home as many as 8 birds sit atop rooftops all day long and just state. I have a a barely 2 year old daughter but she cannot stay with me because of the TMAU. Coupled with my schizophrenia and Tourette everybody now avoids me. As I type these words I have the urge to go see my daughter but I cannot.  Sometimes have to wait till it's dark before instep out. 

We live in a very unjust world. I guess everything happens for a reason. I have gone beyond the point of frustration and pain. Now I just take codeine all day to numb the pain.",-0.9876,408

"I was almost diagnosed with schizophrenia, but my doctors changed their minds. I have most of the symptoms; hallucinations (audio, visual, olfactory, tactile, and I forgot the official name of the taste one, but that too), delusions (I thought I was a werewolf, that I could control the weather, that people had cameras in their eyes and recorded me, that I was a rotting corpse, etc.), catatonic episodes, paranoia, and basically all the usual things people think about when someone mentions schizophrenia. I've been to 13 mental hospitals and have been on dozens of medications, including antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antianxieties, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers. They decided I wasn't schizophrenic because the antipsychotics didn't help at all. It was actually the anticonvulsants (seizure meds. I went on them to see if it would help with my mood swings) that helped with the hallucinations and delusions. So what do I have? Well, I've been officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety (type unspecified), PTSD, dystonia and dyskinesia (neurological disorders), and psychosis (type unspecified). The schizophrenia-like symptoms started when I was 11 and I recently found out that it was all caused by the neurological disorders that I mentioned above. The trauma that caused the PTSD happened when I was 12, then everything spiraled from there. I'm 19 now and I still experience frequent hallucinations, but I'm actually doing really well and I'm in college pursuing a degree in psychology. My best friend (who I met in college last year) has schizophrenia and we experienced the same symptoms growing up. We both also have PTSD and bipolar disorder. People shouldn't assume that everyone who experiences these symptoms has schizophrenia or that they're dangerous/crazy/destined to be unsuccessful. Schizophrenics (and those like me) are perfectly capable of doing anything we put our minds to. They're productive members of society and most of the time, you can't even tell if someone is experiencing these things.",0.4433,382

"The Bible tells of a man that everyone said was 'crazy"" because he heard voices and cut himself and ran around naked and lived in a cave. Jesus told them he is not crazy he is full of demons. Jesus walked up to the man and spoke to the entities inside the man and asked, what is your name? and the entities responded, We are Legion, for are many. Jesus began to cast them out and they begged him to not cast them out. They asked him to be put into the heard of swine nearby. Jesus cast them into the swine that were near the sea. When the demons entered the swine..the Bible says the swine went crazy and ran into the sea and drowned themselves. The Bible says the number of the swine was 2000. The man had 2000 demons in him. The interesting thing is the demons wanted to live in the swine but the swine could not handle them, it drove them ""crazy"" that's why they drowned themselves. They could not behave normally with those demons, neither can humans.",-0.7441,206

"This is my sons account, he has global delay, but has been struggling to sleep for a fair while now. He's mentioned voices in his head, but when taken to the Psychologist he plays it down ,saying that he knows the difference between reality and fiction.The Psychologist hasvaccepted this, but I'm becoming concerned due to his exhaustion...School has contacted me again about him falling asleep in class...he is 13, was diagnosed with global delay at the age of 6, but was being observed, and assessed constantly from age 2. Please help if you can...I can't read his mind so do not know if he is hiding this or any other condition from me. Mybpoor boy is unreasonably terrified of being medicated, and as his mother I have attended unending courses etc. to find/learn other strategies to handle his behaviour in other ways. I will always do that for him, but if he has a for that Drs will take it out of my control he's understandingly going to try to hide it .He isolates himself in his room(he has younger sisters that annoy him though) but I think he isolates himself to 
much.if you can respond to  this comment please use my account, Karen McKenna, on google+. If possible...thank you,and much respect and appreciation for the awareness you are raising*",-0.7003,256
