"So PROUD of you guys! The hardest part is accepting it and making peace with yourself for being GAY! It is terrifying and scary! But when you do, it will set you FREE. You can finally be YOU and not pretend to be someone else you learned to hate! You will be so much HAPPIER, more CONFIDENT, and so much more COMFORTABLE in your own skin! So don't deny it, don't lie to yourself, don't pretend, don't be scared! Be true to yourself cause GAY is OK!",0.9836,101

"THIS IS A REALLY LONG STORY ABOUT A FRIEND I USED TO KNOW WHO HAD A CRUSH ON ME ... 
I had a friend once she told me that she bi lets call her gabby , we were only in 5th grade i was kinda shocked . the next year we kinda grew apart because we were in different classes and we just made new friends but we would still hangout ... until ... one week in term 3 she was acting really weird around me and so were a lot of her friends . That same day one of my friend's , taylah told me that this girl 'gabby' liked someone in our friend group at first i thought it was me but then i was like ""nah i dont think so she knows im straight and dont look at girls that way""
THE NEXT DAY - LUNCH BREAK- one of her friends told me that "" 'gabby' likes someone in our friend group"" i told her i already knew that then she said that someone was ... me ... i started laughing and said 
"" thats a funny joke , you can tell me who she really likes "" she had a straight face and said me ... again ... i walked up to 'gabby' and she wouldn't say anything to me or even look at me ... i walked of because i was trying to talk to her for like10 minutes . After that we realy didn't talk to each other anymore . But since we were in year 6 we had a prom at our school and we had to dance together in one of the dances. now I'm in grade 7 and i aaw her at the trainstation it was really awkward luckily she didnt see me otherwise she would have made a video about it ... cause she has a youtube channel ... actually she might see this comment  so ... hi?",0.9945,341
