"+Earth is Flat LIE
It is a known fact, attested to by the thousands of mountaineers (and the millions of pilots - myself included) that the atmospheric pressure decreases at a very predictable rate with increasing elevation, from 1013hpa (14.6PSI) at sea level to a pressure of 337hpa (4.8PSI) at the elevation of somewhere like the summit of Mt Everest.
And it even gets lower.

So, let me ask you a question: Where is the solid barrier that exists between that high pressure at low altitude and that low pressure at high altitude? What is the reason why that high pressure air near the sea does not rush up the side of Mt Everest to equalise the pressure there? Where's the barrier that prevents this?
How can this known fact of a pressure gradient - from high to low pressure with increasing altitude - exist without some solid barrier stopping that pressure from equalising?
I know the answer - everyone who went to school knows the answer, but your delusion demands that you deny the existence of this answer:

"+Earth is Globe TRUTH
Your entire comment says one thing- and one thing only:
You do not understand gravity (and physics in general).
Since your opinions about this topic are based on sheer ignorance (and at best a strawman version of gravity), your mere personal opinions are utterly worthless - because they are objectively wrong.
And they are dismissed.

May your god be less to you, too.",0.1381,80
"+Earth is NOT Flat TRUTH
_""Your example simply is not the same as mine. ""_
My example proves your question is based on a false premise - and the conclusions derived from a false premise are also false.

_"" We are told gravity holds down oceans to a ball spinning at about 1000mph at the equator, so that must be a tremendous force, ""_
No, the centripetal force due to the Earth's very slow rotation (not spin - the rate of rotation is half the rate of the hour hand of a clock) does not require _""a tremendous force""_ to hold things down at all. You are arguing from ignorance - which is all you can ever do.
 The centripetal acceleration at the Equator is given by four times pi squared times the radius of the Earth divided by the period of rotation squared (4×π^2×R/T^2). Earth's period of rotation is a sidereal day (86164.1 seconds, slightly less than 24 hours), and the equatorial radius of the Earth is about 6378 km. This means that the centripetal acceleration at the Equator is about 0.03 m/s^2 (metres per second squared). Compare this to the acceleration due to gravity which is about 9.8 m/s^2 and you can see how tiny an effect this is - you weigh about 0.3% less at the equator than at the poles.

And this small difference in apparent weight has been confirmed.

_""Are clouds, then, moving at over 1000mph""_
With respect to an external observer - the same frame of reference used to measure the tangential speed of the Earth's surface, then yes, of course they are. But from the frame of reference of the Earth's surface, then no they are NOT moving at over 1000mph.
The concept of different ""frames of reference"" is something that can cause confusion for those who are uneducated or cannot accept their education due to some form of mild mental retardation that renders them incapable of grasping this core concept.
Or those whose delusion requires them to reject this education because it conflicts with their fantastic beliefs.

_"" How come a hovering helicopter, after one hour, is not displaced 1000 miles toward east?""_
Because it is moving WITH the surface of the Earth - which is the frame of reference applicable in this case.
These questions are the questions a CHILD would ask. 
These are concepts that a CHILD is capable of understanding when their questions are answered.
Are you not embarrassed that you are apparently asking ""gotcha"" questions that are asked by a child? Are you not embarrassed that you are apparently unable to understand the ANSWERS to these questions that most single digit aged children are capable of understanding?

_"" Relative density governs... <followed by ignorant falsehoods and lies>""_
Differing relative densities of fluids or gasses are meaningless without gravity.
Differing relative densities of gasses cause the force of buoyancy to be experienced - and this is the equation for buoyancy: 
Fb = ρgV = ρghA
In both of these alternate equations that little 'g' is the force of gravity.
Without gravity, there is no force causing the different elements in the atmosphere (which have different densities) to move because there is no force of buoyancy (multiplying anything by zero results in zero being the answer).
Without gravity there would be no pressure gradient in the atmosphere and no differentiation of gasses based on their molecular weight/differing densities.",-0.8648,667

"NASAs budget today isn't anything near as bad as many people make it out to be. Now forgive my laziness here as I've looked for these numbers before but today I'm winging it and hoping I remember correctly. 

NASAs 1960 budget was 10% of GDP later dropping to 2.5 % of GDP. It has continued to fall as a percentage and it's this percentage that either dishonest, or stupid people point to. A shrinking percentage of GDP is not proof of a shrinking budget. In fact it's close enough to Apollo era spending, it's just spent in the most inane illogical way that it doesn't deliver a fraction of what it could. Check out cost plus contracting. Then there's the structure of nasa. The politicians and jobs programs. And then there's the ""legal mafia"" approach to government and tax payers. In other words they've been looking after their best interests and trying to get as much money as possible. They over spend and take way longer than necessary. Eg they estimated Space X would spend 4 billion. However they spent 320 million less than 1/10th of the NASA estimate and 1/3rd of the time. In 2009 SpaceHab came in at 1/8th of the price.",0.34,227

All she had to do is make sure I missed court the one time I could have changed everything, and that day nobody came and the court wouldn't let me do it over the phone and I couldn't find anyone else to get me 3 hours away in the four hours I had left to get there. So here I am, 14 years later and I owe 60,000 to a kid who's not mine and am constantly threatened by child support who I've constantly told I want a test, it's impossible for the child to be mine unless somehow she carried the kid in her belly for over a year and she would have had to violate the restraining order I had on her, plus I think I would have noticed since she terrifies me and I'm still seeing psyche about the rape and damage she did while we were together. I had just turned 18 and she was 26 and I was super shy and had trouble saying No to people and yes. I'm an idiot who couldn't say no when she set up the justice of the peace marriage thing without me knowing and dropped it all on me not even a week before it happened because her whole family came for it and I didn't know I was getting married. I never wanted to get married, especially after just turning into an adult but she didn't start the crazy abuse yet. That came right after. That's when she would do things like punch my stomach if I'm sick, chase me with knives, fake her own suicidal attempts for me not wanting to sleep with her, her pulling at my hair and shoving my head into walls and keeping me from locking myself in the bathroom to stay away from her because I don't know what she did with my keys or my shoes and it was winter and the police wouldn't do anything because we were married. Even when she took everything I owned I couldn't call the police, I had to pay to take her to court. But I thought it was over when she was gone. That is... until she started showing up with a big knife and would literally chase me until I found safety, but it always resulted in my tires being slashed. I finally got the restraining order and thought it was over again until about 5 years later I all of a sudden got hit with child support and found out she was claiming a child she had way after all that was mine and I've been paying for it and pleading for help from anyone who will listen, which is nobody, and am close to just getting out of this existence. I know there's nothing after this, but it seems less painful.
        I also can't enjoy anything anymore without something making me think of all she did to me, it's almost like she's right back here again. Especially after my child support moved to a new county for some reason and they doubled down on everything pushing me closer to the edge and they don't care that she's lying to her kid and how sick that is. They are just like thugs who just threaten you for money and won't do anything to help. I'm getting by on 200 a month now and they expect me to pay 350 a month even though they aren't legally supposed to take government assistance, but if they try putting me in jail over the hell they already made my life, then they will only be taking my dead body there because at that point, all hope will have been drained.",-0.9943,737

_""thrust of a rocket needs something to push on to create motion""_
It does that, sort of. The rocket is pushing against the exhaust gasses (the exhaust has the same mass as the propellant/oxidiser before it was burnt) and the expanding exhaust gasses are pushing against the rocket.
Does that dumbed down explanation make sense to your tiny mind?

But more correctly - the mass times the velocity of the exhaust gasses from a rocket provide the necessary momentum rearwards for the reaction forces to push the rocket forwards.

It skyrocketed for the Apollo “mission” and then declined to little. That insane amount of money was needed and was used to fund the lighting for the studio. 




It’s a joke. Obviously the moon landing happened (or did it?) but please leave a like so people freak out thx",0.2846,143

Explain one thing: how can a pressurized system, the earth, exist next to a vacuum without a solid barrier between the two and there is no pressure equalization??? Do you have an experiment to demonstrate it? Pray tell.",-0.465,48
"Walter Boxhead 
Sure.. and the ""gravity"" skips the space station, but keeps it in orbit, and then reaches the moon at 238k miles away. Wow! ""Gravity"" can do anything.. strange though how it cannot pull the moon towards earth, and how sun's ""gravity"" just cannot pull earth towards it. There is no gravity, it only makes sense in equations, not reality. I dont blame you, dont take it personal, we are all fooled.. I just found out sooner than you. May God bless you.",0.7901,106
"Walter Boxhead Your example simply is not the same as mine. 
I will leave you with this: We are told gravity holds down oceans to a ball spinning at about 1000mph at the equator, so that must be a tremendous force, which apparently cannot stop wooden fire smoke from rising upwards. Are clouds, then, moving at over 1000mph (suppose 60mph wind gusts would be 1060mph actual speed?) How come a hovering helicopter, after one hour, is not displaced 1000 miles toward east? The answers are simple: earth does not spin and there is no gravity. Relative density governs how things order and what falls, drowns or floats, or flies upwards (excepting flying machines). What you have in upper atmosphere is the lightest atomic weight gases, noble gases: that is why pressure drops.",-0.304,155
