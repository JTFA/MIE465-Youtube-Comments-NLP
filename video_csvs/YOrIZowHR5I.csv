I just want to ask if u have a video or if not, can you make one?

A video about how to make or how do you bring back the moisture of your hair.

Because everytime I go to the salon to have my hair cut, they always tell me

""your hair is so dry.""
""what product do you use?""


and I haven't had any treatment with my hair except for Hot Oil!! 

and I never cared about what product do I use before.
