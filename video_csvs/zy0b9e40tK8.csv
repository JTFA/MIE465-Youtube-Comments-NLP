"Ok,really now,german actors are not something interesting.No feeling at all in their actions,no passion.They just don't 'have it'.It's in their culture.No matter if they are trying to be serious or angry or funny their face has the same expression.
The plot of the show is interesting but has many fails,gaps and anti-climax situations.As I said the main problem is the hypocritical of nearly every character.For example a mother is losing her son (Mikkel).Where is her natural reaction?No tears,no panic or despair.Then her son goes back to 1986.he moves towards his home and someone else opens the door.ok, but why the hell he leaves that door open to a stranger and leaves?Small details are making the difference.
