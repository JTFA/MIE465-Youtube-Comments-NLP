"A lot of people are saying that he's being bullied because of things he said and does. That might be true. His mother, from what I've read, is a racist who tried to profit from her child's pain. After hearing this, a lot of people has taken back their support; but, he's a kid. He's being taught ignorance from his mother and is confused about why people are mistreating him because of it. Hate the mother and her backwards way of thinking. Support the boy because his pain and confusion is real. Spread love not hate.",-0.6313,109

"Apparently, there's much more to this story.  It's one thing for a parent to post this as a stop bullying campaign.  However, it turns out her go-fund-me account is because she's a single mom & Christmas is coming, etc, etc.

"Folks, bullying is something we should all be against. Why? Because we are human beings. We need better schools with many more teachers AND meditation needs to be part of public education, and should be part of all schools. Why? Science shows that meditation increases the size of the empathy/compassion parts of the brain. By increasing the size of the empathy/compassion parts of the brain we handle the problem of bullying at its source, the troubled human mind.

Let's all strive for a more compassionate world, that is the only reason we are here on this planet.

Also mind-body practices are proven to increase math skills, improve focus, creativity and the ability to learn, and also can reduce ADD/ADHD symptoms in teens. It is literally insane to not have mind-body meditative practices in schools worldwide.

The science is in, we can create a more compassionate world.",0.4956,171

Yes bullying itself is wrong and yes those kids shouldn't have done that, but that is not true. What if he was not bullied? Even if he was there was a reason and the funny thing there was actually a reason, he said racial slurs to other kids at his school to make those so called ""bullies"" to commit those actions. Let's say this if a kid shoots another kid, he therefore should be innocent. Another thing to add is that he most likely faked this to get fame and money, which his mom made a go fund me account and made 50k. The whole entire goal was not to spread awareness of bullying as we believe it is (which would be great), but instead to make MONEY from simple acting. This outrages me because there is no evidence that he was bullied and even if he was, it was deserved. Those flags posted may have angered a few, but they don't really determine whether he is a racist, but they hint it. IT WAS the comments made by his sister and mother made before the video was made, there is evidence that they said these racial slurs (now there is not because they deleted them before uploading the video), but people have screenshotted them. Also he did not get bullied, he bullied the kid who poured milk on him, the kid who poured milk said that he would stop bothering him and told him many times.",-0.2924,277
