"shane silva 
I get that theyâ€™re making money but on average resellers make at least 60% more on the market value.

If they go by exclusivity it works in their favour but it also means the brand is bound by a very small group of people.
 (who most of the time donâ€™t represent the said companies style, target audience or ethics). 

Itâ€™s the same thing the with concert tickets, resellers forced the market to change because of the up scale in prices.",0.4497,97
