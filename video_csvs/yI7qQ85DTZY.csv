"Plz... directors /writers...my head began to spin...sensory overload! Mainly, there were too many big production numbers in one show.... thats cause it was live and everyone went iver the top in each scene . Werent enough lows to carry the highs. NO rest periods.
i loved the simpler scenes with the real theme that shined. Cause... i lost  the message after the show started 15 min in... And of course, it was  obviously politically directed. So, that distracted me, and wearied me. Not so entertaining because if that. 
 I suggest just a few less big numbers...not every scene has to be a show stopper, leg kicker, Radio City Ricket style dancing. I was looking for warm Christmas memories...too sexually inuendoed school teacher scene ...breathy singing? Please...too much singing...should have had more stiry line and dialogue. Im a dancer/singer/ theater person too... so less is more. 
But bravo for your hard work cast and crew! Excellent talent and vocals!",0.7967,199
