"I had hyperthyroidism  and now I have the contrary, hypothyroidism. I discovered  I had hyperthyroidism back in 2015, doctors told me I had it way before that. 
I got my thyroid removed last August 2017. 
I like Wendy would reschedule my appointments and didn't take care of myself. 
I was 190 lbs at one point and then out of nowhere dropped to 140. 
It was a scary site.
On surgery day I had really bad complications, ended up getting blood clots all around my neck. 
I came to a near death experience. I became sedated for 10days. 
I was breathing  thru tube.
My significant  other was with me the whole time watching  out for me making sure everything was going good.
I do not remember nothing at all. 
At the end I was grateful for my wife, my family and friends, but most importantly the doctors and nurses who did their jobs to keep me alive.
Hyperthyroidism, I have Graves Disease, is a bad and can lead to a lot of health issue. 
If you see something or feel something isn't right with you take care of the issue before it gets severe.
Our bodies talk to us and we must listen.

I think she should've let the show go on and let celebs come and guest host it until she feels well again.

People will go on judging others with Thyroid Disease. Only who feels it knows. It's a sad reality. I can't relate to half the symptoms listed for Hypothyroidism but half a million other ones. I don't feel doctors are accurately diagnosing thyroid issues. At least where I'm from.  So many people complain of good lab ranges shown in their TFT results but still feeling really sick. Me for example. I have so many issues but i guess people like me just need a voice and more help generally. Thyroid disease is too highly underestimated.,-0.2108,104
