My sisters has never watched a comic book movie, but they're going to binge watch all the movies to catch up and watch IW the 1st weekend. People who never watched a comic-book movie will see this by the hype alone. 

There isn't any blockbuster movie in April, IW comes out the beginning of May (earlier in Europe I believe) and there isn't another big movie out for a month.

"Hey John!  Hello from Vancouver!  I've seen Black Panther twice already and I understand what you're saying about limited amount of theatre seats, period - how high can you go?  In our local multiplex theatres, other movies were still playing.  Don't forget about the remainder of Top 10 box office this weekend.  Can't say for sure if people went to see Fifty Shades or Peter Rabbit because Black Panther was sold out BUT because other movies were still playing, this means there was room for more BP box office if the multiplex had scheduled movies differently, kwim?  Like if you just look at the remainder of Top 10 box office, there is another 72M on the table shared amongst other movies.  When we left the BP IMAX on Saturday (where the IMAX theatre is #19), we could see that Last Jedi was still playing.  Even some foreign films were playing at Silvercity Riverport which is the closet IMAX for us.  This topic reminds me of something else - back when Force Awakens came out, I heard about a situation in our local news.  A small family owned theatre in a small town on Vancouver Island, opted not to play The Force Awakens because they did not want to tie themselves down to the Disney contract whereby TFA would have to play for 6, 8 or 11 weeks (I forget)!  Since they could only play one movie at a time and this town only had one movie theatre anyway, they said it was a hard decision but they truly did not want to be stuck playing one movie (TFA) for weeks and weeks.  So yea, unless movie theatres stop running ALL other movies, there are more theatre seats/tickets available for these giant blockbusters - finite to be sure but there's a bit more room there!",0.4384,337

This film proves, you don't need an Iron Man, Captain America, Thor or the Guardians of the Galaxy to have a successful MCU film. The proof is in the pudding, ladies and gentlemen. Time to strap in for Avengers: Infinity War. I'm sure it will make history as well.

The difference was the Star Wars brand. Now Marvel Studios grown exponentially in the last Six years. Adding Dr Strange, Spider-Man and Now Black Panther to their ranks.The hype is strong with Infinity War. Everybody is excited to see Thanos in action.

I don't completely agree that IW can't make up the 46 Million over Black Panther I agree it probably won't. But your argument about the theaters being full and so forth. TFA was in 114 more theaters than Black Panther was. And yes a lot of people clearly went to go see it during that four day weekend because its 4 day total was damn close to TFA even if it was vs a three day weekend. Black Panthers 16-20 was only 5.9 million difference. Now who is to say if BP had 114 more theaters to sell at maybe it would have made that additional 6 million.,0.0403,114

Let`s take TFA, combined, in that weekend when TFA was released, the first 5 movies grossed combined almost 290 million dollars and first 10 movies grossed over 300 million, so it is possible for a movie to single gross over 300 million dollars OW it all theaters show only that movie and enough people are interested.",-0.8674,129

I had to go into the city to see Black Panther, as my local cinema wasnt showing it - They didnt show Thor Ragnorok either, but before that they showed all the Marvel films. 

I hope disney stops exploiting cinema chains, as they struggle to run a successful business as it is, and disney doesnt need the extra ticket cuts, they make enough money as it is.",-0.543,160

Also, Thanos can't ever mean a reboot for the MCU, as they recently reacquired the Marvel comics A-list. The X-Men universe is insanely huge in it's story options. Meanwhile, the DC A list is getting roasted, and will be roasted in comparisons, for years to come.",0.0516,86
"John, comparing the WW novelty to BP in terms of affecting future films is ridiculous. The main reason the DCEU is suffering and JL severely under performed has nothing to do with WW just being a novelty. One thing you have to remember, there is no BvS movie in the MCU. The most divisive film in the history of the superhero genre. Then there's the complete lack of direction and organization of WB concerning the DCEU. It's like comparing apples and oranges.",-0.8625,90
"John, my 90 year old Dad drove himself to the theater to see Black Panther by himself! I was floored! He said he is going back to see it in 3D!!!!!! He has not been to the movies in about 2 decades!You are right Black Panther  was novel. I dressed up for the movie in an African Gown that I bought in South Africa. (I have seen it 3x)  My sister, a doctor in Texas flew to LA to see Black Panther with me and my husband at an African Arts fundraiser on February 15. Everyone dressed up and 3 of the African Arts members were in the movie! My 81 year old mother has seen it 2x. 1 time with 10 women from a sorority (The Delta's, they wear red and gold). The Black Sororities and Fraternities feel that all of the colors represented different Black Fraternal organizations. Black Sororities and Fraternities bought out theaters across the country. This is something special!",0.7326,186
"John, your logic is severely flawed, as usual. First off, not everyone who wants to see Infinity War in the theater cares about seeing BP in the theater. Some people prefer watching movies at home unless they're extra special or anticipated. Secondly, if Infinity War can't break 250 m because no other Marvel movie, including BP reached that amount... how do you explain the logic behind Force Awakens doing so well? The most successful opening for a Star Wars movie prior was 108 million.",-0.2182,95
"John, you’re wrong.  TFA didn’t sell out every screen during its opening weekend.  There are a few ways to debunk your argument.

1) The Force Awakens was only released at 4134 theaters.  This isn’t as wide as it could have been released as evidenced by the fact that Despicable Me 3 currently holds the record for being the widest released movie at 4535 theaters.

2) The Force Awakens doesn’t hold the record for the largest business for a day when you exclude previews.  That record is held by Jurassic World which did 69.6 million on its opening Saturday.

3) Another way it could have made more money is a higher split between dollars earned from premium formats (IMAX, 3D, etc) versus 2D shows.

4) The runtime for a movie could be much less than The Force Awakens which would increase the # of showtimes and thus the weekend gross.

If we only focus on point 2, there is a possibility alone of a movie having at the very least the following breakdown

Previews - 57 million (from The Force Awakens)
Friday - 69.6 million (Jurassic World’s Saturday showing a very possible Gross from a single days business)
Saturday - 69.6 million (same again)
Sunday - 60.5 million (The Force Awakens opening Sunday)

This alone shows the possibility of a 256.7 million opening weekend without examining the other points at all.

If we just apply The Force Awakens per-theatre average to Despicable Me 3’s max theater count, we get to 272 million.

Plus, the biggest argument that says a 300 million opening weekend is possible is if we look at the charts for the largest weekend in history.  The opening weekend for The Force Awakens did 305 million between all movies.  This alone shows that there is enough seating capacity for 300 million plus is one movie just dominates all the screens.",-0.9515,357

I told him that infinity war will have a lot of scenes in wakanda so he said “okay well then I’ll just rent it at home before infinity war comes out” and then I had to explain that BP won’t be rentable until after infinity war’s opening weekend. So now he caved in and bought BP tickets. So Infinity war is the only reason my dad is seeing BP. I’m betting there’s a lot more cases like this out there.

john you are using your area as representing the whole country. i have been following showings in my area and only 2 showings sold out all weekend which means there is room to grow. i think the reason why infinity war will do force awakens or bigger numbers is because the increased african american audience that showed up will show up again since black panther will be featured in the advertising along with people who sat out this movies opening.  i don't know if it can do much better than the force awakens because it would have to sell out a lot of the weekend but i think it will be close.,0.0129,116
