9-3 first in the west,0.0,5
"BECAUSE HE DOESN'T""T HAVE TO carry all the fucking load anymore.... Duhhhhhh",0.0,15
"Because he doesn't need to anymore. Defenders play him close and double-team him a lot, opening up a lot of space on the floor. He's the bait that leaves the lane open for other players. Defending Steph is a Catch-22, you play him too close and you open the floor for 2-5. You play him too far and he unleashes a barrage behind the line.",0.7579,74
