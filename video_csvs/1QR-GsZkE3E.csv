"(((We are all in a Spiritual battle for our SOULS!!!)))

***There is an ongoing Spiritual battle for all of our SOULS! And all of us are being used as guinea pigs for SATAN and you don‚Äôt even know it! 

*** But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and (((SORCERERS))), and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Revelation 21:8). 

(Sorcery=Pharmakeia in the Greek Language=Pharmacy=DRUG USERS! 

This is a freewill open door portal, to allow them to come into your body/temple of every foul and unclean Spirit/Demon. Your freewill choice‚Äôs gives them the access so they can take it over). 

*** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul. (Proverbs 8:36). (So when you are sinning against God you are sinning against your own Soul. 

*** abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. (1 Peter 2:11). (Lust is a name of a Demonic Spirit. Just like the Spirit of Anger, Homosexuality and Pride etc. 

***Now with this CERN/The Devils Portal being opened up in the name of, ‚ÄúScience‚Äù, this world is becoming HELL which, the Baphomet/Satan wants as his saying goes, ‚ÄúAs above, so Below.‚Äù This is why you need to put the Blood of Jesus all over yourselves and your family members. And by showing Jesus you love him by obeying his commandments‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

***(Jesus): You will know the truth and the truth will set you free. (John 8:32). (Set you free from what??? Demonic Spirits!!! Submit to God and Resist the devil and he will flee from you!!! (James 4:7). 

*** And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. (Luke 10:17).

***Keep in mind, God will not allow Demonic Spirits to destroy mankind. Demonic Spirits, through mans freewill, is the only way they can cause harm to us and make us hurt or destroy our selves. Jesus, my king and hopefully your king as well, has them on a short leash or they would destroy the earth if they got the chance. 

***Remember, Demonic Spirits are inter-dimensional beings with alien bodies. Case in point, ‚ÄúThe Greys‚Äù, are the working bees of SATAN!!!

*** For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (Ephesians 6:12).",-0.9695,568
