"+Ancient Melanin, 

   I'm a ""dumb fucking piece of shit"" --- yeah, that makes complete sense. It makes even more sense to call me that when you say Egyptians are/were swarthy, Sub-Saharan peoples, even though it's well-established that Today and during when they flourished they were depicted as Arabic-tinged peoples. You can actually see who they are Today. Again, it's not difficult to look the documentation of them in their habitat. Hey, oh! Just like you see in the present-day, all throughout North Africa! What's funny is that a Sub-Saharan African himself would deconstruct what you're saying in a moments' notice. Your mini tirade isn't germane, but I'll oblige. For refutation #2, let it be known that Jesus Christ the prophet/carpenter wasn't congruent with the Euro-centric depictions, nor is he African. Why is there debate? Because denial-ridden, low self-esteem numb nuts (and your ""overlords"") like you perpetuate it.
