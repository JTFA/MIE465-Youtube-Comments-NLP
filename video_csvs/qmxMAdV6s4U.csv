"Ok this movie has a point, a good one in fact but still it isn't enough. It isn't a great movie. Every movie is trying to say something. There is always a message. Most of the time liberal political stuff. This time, what this movie is trying to say is: ""Hollywood, the place where everyone plays to be someone, full of characters we admire and love, is a place full of sociopaths and psychopaths. And the people who actually are more human and have conscience, are the ones we fear and reject the most, the weirdos, the lonely ones, people that really need the love."" That is literally the message. Even actors playing to be actors, like the dude pretending to be Denzel Washington, that's is also so accurate, literally Hollywood. The message is deep, simple and clean. But for me still not close to be a great film...",0.1407,176

"So I just saw the movie without watching the trailer. I enjoyed it, I underestimate it and I'm mad that I did but literally just gives away the entire fucking movie. Like if I've seen this trailer before watching the movie, I probably wouldn't have wanted to get see it. Like I've seen some 30 second tv trailer but I didn't really look at them or listen. The only knowledge I had was that it was game night gone wrong. Like this trailer gave away the plot twist and revealed some of the others. Really hate when they do this! Like literally this 2, 3 minute trailer just spoiled the movie and it'll just seem like predictable nonsense when you watch it.",0.5381,133

"We went to see this movie when it first hit the theaters. It was hit or miss at times. There were times when I found it confusing and boring. Of course, there were a few interesting parts in the movie. There is a very creepy guy who plays Jason's neighbor. This creepy guy is always in a policeman's uniform. I will not give away the ending to the movie. I thought it was a very average ending. However, the first 30-minutes of the movie, I will admit, I almost got up and walked out. I didn't find the start of the movie to keep my interest. If I had to rate this movie based on 5 stars, I would give it 3 stars.",0.5719,141
