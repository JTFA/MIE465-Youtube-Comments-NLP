"**Aug 26, 2017 First time i have seen Milky Way cloud with naked eyes**
Guys, firstly, it wont appear as colorful as what we see in videos.. I was heading back from Coimbatore (City in TamilNadu state of India) was travelling by Trivendrum - Indore Ahalyanagari express. Around 7:20 pm, train was passing through green mountain ranges, i have been observing my gps, it was pointing near ""Mathampatti"", i am into this milky way stuff since few months, i always wanted to see it with naked eyes, with that thought still in mind i kept my head to window grills and looked up, guys believe me, i have never seen so many stars in my life, i was shocked, uncountable bright shining stars, i rushed towards the door, as train was moving at high speed i didn't leaned out completely, holding onto the door i slightly kept my head out and saw up, i was surprised, i believe that was a milky way but i was not sure, then i opened the stellarium app and saw milky way was exactly above my head, luckily after few minutes train completely slowed down, then i completely leaned out... And that was the moment of my life, it was milkyway appearing like a cloud from one corner to other corner in the dark sky.. i observed, when the train was passing by small villages, the number stars i was seeing reduced drastically. Once the village was passed, again i was able to see sky full of stars. I was shocked, even that little light of villages affected the night sky visibility. Now i am back to my city Hyderabad, and i decided, i will be going in hunt of dark skies with a DSLR atleast one weekend every month.",0.5584,340
