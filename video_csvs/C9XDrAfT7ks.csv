Just because it was widespread does not mean it wasn't okay to be disgusted by it. And it was disgusting BECAUSE it went against the ideology of human rights, which derive from religion. So please think through your arguments.

"BEAUTY INSIDE VS EVERY DAY

I LOVED Beauty Inside. I thought this was a Hollywood copy. But upon doing research the premise of body switching and love are the same, but the stories are different.

In Beauty Inside, the guy gains this 'uncontrollable ability' at a certain age and every day gets a new body. His father had it too. He's still the same person and wakes up in his own bed. He meets the girl and feels a connection and falls in love with her. Watching from a distance at first. Then trying to convince her that he is the same guy. Then they try to make it work, but it ends up taking a toll on her. This was based off an Intel and Toshiba  social mini film released August 16th 2012 with Gopher Grace and Mary Elisabeth Winstead. A remake is in preproduction in 2018 featuring Emilia Clarke.

Every Day is about a wandering soul that never had a real body. It temporarily obtains a different persons body every day and wakes up in a different bed different family every day. When it does it also has that person's memories. Then it borrows a boy's body and that soul falls in love with that boys girlfriend. This was based off Every Day novel released August 28th 2012. 

Personally Beauty Inside feels more real to me. Better portrayal and cinematography. Every Day has too much of that Hollywood flash. I'll still give it a fair chance though.",0.995,275

Gender and physicality are very important. 

Physicality is a part of romantic love.
So as long as this love is romantic (not platonic), physicality is always going to play a role, we can't set it aside.

It's a matter of who you are willing to be physical with.
And depending on this willingness, you are going to be open to experimenting, and with experimenting sometimes grows fondness, and after fondness comes the acceptance and after that the realization of being something else than normal straight person.

Being pan/gay/bi is about breaking and rebellion against the natural role of human beings.
And some find strength in that!. That's why more people are riding to this Lgbtq+ train just for the sake of the thrill! 

That's why I say being lgbtq+ is not something imprinted in you. 
It's something you are willing to do and take full responsibility of.",0.9898,173

Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down. Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. Dear ones, not only is Jesus with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory.

You can find lots of LGBT movies on just Netflix, this isn't the first, but there's not a lot of confirmed asexuals in movies (I can't think of any actually, but that might just be bc im thinking on the spot rn) so anxiety makes sense when they want there to be ace representation. It's not ""all about them,"" it's all about the ace community.
