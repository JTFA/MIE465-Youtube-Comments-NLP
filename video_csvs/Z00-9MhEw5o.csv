"Vegan is American Indian word for ""Bad hunter"". Sorry, I am an omnivore leaning more on the carnivore side. I eat anything and everything. I could be on Andrew Zimmern's show Bizarre foods. Growing up 100 years ago my Grandmother who was a hillbilly raised during the depression said ""what ain't killin' is fattin' and I ain't dead yet"" and she lived to be 92 years old. My other Grandmother always said clean your plate so I could be on the ""good sam clean plate club"" never mind  and would also say ""starving kids in china would eat that"" so I always ate my food. Growing up there were 8 of us in the family mom cooked like shit but usually cooked enough for 6 and I always got seconds. just kidding follow the logic never mind.
