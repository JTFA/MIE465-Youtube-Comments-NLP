"I was recently thinking about color and how to describe it. I think the best way to describe color is a limited form of art. There are only so many colors we can see. And everything must be assigned a color. Because of this, Color is already a difficult concept. Think of music, For example. There are only so many tones that exist. You can't create more tones. However when you combine those different tones into a pattern, You get music. Black and white are like a single static tone. But they are still two different tones. Perhaps just a low or high note. Yet those tones/colors can still be used. When you think of a specific peace of music. It invokes a emotion. 

What I am trying to say is, Thinking of a color alone is not a good way to describe it. Art and music is a good way to describe color. Is each tone could represent a color. If it was impossible to combine tones to create music, That would be color. If you then take those tones and combine them that would be art. It's only thanks to the difference to those colors that they have meaning. If the entire world was one color, It would be similar to a single note. We would have no concept of color invoking different tastes or emotions. Because that single note is all we where exposed to.

I guess shades of color would be different pitches of said tone also. Which opens up more ""Music"" or ""Colors""
A interesting thing is. We see in only three base colors. Which is actually a really limited color range.
For example some reptile and insects can see many more primary colors. I believe I read something that states a certain reptile can see 300+ different primary colors. Which is impossible for people who already see color to imagine. That would be like several million new tones being added, If a piano was 300x more complicated and had 300x more combinations. There would be many more colors then there are plays in a game of chess (Which is already a number beyond human imagination.)

A depressing part about seeing color. Is it very rarely can actually tell you anything factual about a object that is unknown to you. It's very preconceived in a way. You get much more information from actually ""Seeing"" sometime than by knowing it's color.
You could still study botany and identify every plant that exists without color. However you can not identify every plant by simple knowing it's color. Color is really limited. Just like music. If you listen to many different composers focusing on the same type of music. You notice patterns. 

Idk, I am really just going off the top of my head here. I've been typing/thinking about this for hours now.... I am sure I could explain better with more time/effort though.",0.8385,555

I'm not an expert. Just thinking about this right now and this is just my opinion: You can imagine a concept of something without having a picture of it in your head. Sometimes I'm reading a book and instantly pictures pop up in my head but sometimes they don't and I just can't imagine what it would look like but I still understand the concept of it...

"oh man that was utterly hilarious. Laughed throughout the whole thing where hes guessing the animals...

would LOVE to see another episode of that where he tries to guess anatomically accurate (or at least semi-accurate) figures of animals ... those ones were too cartoony; although it made for a great episode so well done to the girl who sent them in",0.9565,66
question for next video: if you had the chance to see only one thing than go back to being blind what would that thing be ?,-0.1779,27

"this was unfair since they were caricatures. I don't think any sighted person would have done much better with their eyes closed trying to guess what these things were. on a side note, I got notification about this video from youtube.",-0.0516,45
