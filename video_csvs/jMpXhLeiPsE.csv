"made me smile at the end and made me want to buy a ticket. What a Cool ad...thanks lotto..

p.s, it doesn't really matter which way the airport is, it was all a prank on Satish,  the armour guard truck wasn't even a armour guard truck in real life,  the bank wasn't actually a bank they're just part of the complete story, the prank set up was to helping ray let Satish know he finally won and was going to split it 50/50 . He drove away making Satish think they were gonna go rogue, once he (Satish) knew it was a prank they probably would've turned around and went back over the bridge, or they could both live in the shore heading home to pack there bags to go away, we don't know, the whole point was to let Satish know eat had won and did it in a clever way making him believe they were stealing all the money.",0.9137,179
