"Angenial grapple grasping on a belief still in evolution of confidential happenings stilll in apparantcees not in any liasional expectulant ordering, so yeh false stans in on a blind relevance that I sought and successfully overseen with relativity and relevance that favoured my naturalistic inclusiona of everything been of the same or simular too in its formation and outlook towards movement have duffled with out need to muffle this shuffle and its hustle! 

Relativity and atmospheric calculation of everything been of the same relative outcome which is to continue via metaphysical reordering of needs to be into matters of needs be.

We are a reflection of own previous journeys through this encology of contiued happenings of seperated matters that have been massed and re-addressed through lineal needs be holding personal attraction to first come to be after previous been a being of seperate experiences so's to better add to the one enviroment we all share.

So these arcadians whom stand in for and appeal towards peoples nearest confidence whilst seeking needs of balance snap an oncall to seek their previous beings and past doing whilst deflection of character breaks possible on-core of subconclusional happen stances to diverge into opposing attraction to leason follow ons later through broken evolvement offering lease too be elsewhere.

Well before miosis can first take directive acknowledgwment of nucliatic activity it must first form its dna base via protein chains ordering such instances to occorr through sequence. Although its the first strand of grouped proteins that determines whether or not theirs a relationship of likewise instance between the chicken and egg. Well by starting with the beak both qualities become part of the same sequence. Well almost that is..   After the first sequence the beak must digest through to its end via multiple other sequences first bottoming out on a top to bottom inside out outlook that brings you back to the beak.  Meaning the gestation period of first becoming two of the same dna instrument begins via incubational influx to cause kinetical stimulus through precise turning to stimulates growth of initial intentions to develop feotal possibity to actualise through sizemic repitition creating strengh in mass to cause the shell and the beak to meet thus causing connective relevance to create competition for space to max kinetic excitement of becoming to cause inner seperation of the outer to break movement and hatch out into a hatchling.
Ie from the beak you travel down the gullet to the gut, then through excretion it realises mass and size, followed by characteristical choices of texture, until mass is in competition for space and breaks free,  thus giving an hatchling.

"I don't know, they set up the bar so high for themselves with 'Morning view' (my personal opinion), 'Make yourself' and 'A crow left of the murder', kind on like the same level, Last grenades was good and then they seem to have lost the touch, their sound is not the same and it feels forced, like they're not able to come up with great material like before, so they conform with just using filler, I don't know if I'm explaining myself well, but I can't feel them no more, not this new stuff. I'm a fan of theirs, their music, but in my opinion they haven't come with anything great like the good ol' days. Maybe it's the hair, they all grew it long, except Ben. Until then, I'll just keep reminiscing enjoying their previously mentioned material.",0.9841,166

"Mike M They would tell you themselves that old sound and naming of the band reflects their immaturity at the time. That's why a  band's sound grows because they do! Look at the band's they toured with back then like Primus, where are they now???? It would've been career suicide to keep off beat metal funk going. They also do songs reminiscent of older tracks like 'No Fun' so I'm not really seeing your point. I dont like people trying to speak for artists on what they should've done when I know this band have giving it serious thought on expanding their sound!!! It's not fair for someone to tell me to do the same thing I did at 18 when I'm 40 now!!!!",0.7481,140

And about doing the same stuff at 18 I'm now 29 I do it again for shits and giggles and hopefully better with a new twist and they got the chops to do it as well",0.9458,141

[Verse 1]
I feel like I may have been here before
All of it looks so familiar
I wanna see beyond the obvious
So show me a new constellation

[Chorus]
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

I feel like I’m always the last to know

But where is the bliss in all this ignorance?
Oh just show me a new constellation

You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

Never again, never again, never again
Don’t you get it?
I only want to break your spell
Ohh oh ohhh
Don’t you get it?
You’re the snake that eats its tail

Hey!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Hey!

"Primus?? To use that earlier commented philosophy, The Brown Album was the beginning of the end for them! LOL Incubus didn't tour with those other bands til' after they made a mark. Deftones and Korn has expanded and experimented with their sound as well. Both Korn and Incubus have Skrillex co-produced albums! Still being around and actually being relevant is two different things as well. Make yourself was the beginning of their growth and not end as they have charted, toured, and diversified fan base better than pre make yourself tour mates and they couldn't have done it without those changes in sound. I get what you are saying though because the band Chevelle doesn't sound exactly the same but has stayed more consistent to their original sound than Incubus has, even though early Incubus was rather complicated in musical arrangements. Chevelle has opened for Metallica and Bush before but we'll never see a two band Metallica/Bush ticket! I think a switch in styles open up doors of opportunity and generate revenue for these artists that a one style sound could never provide!!!!",0.9427,203

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
