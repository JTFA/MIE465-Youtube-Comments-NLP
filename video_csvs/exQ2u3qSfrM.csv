"I honestly don't know why but I can't bring myself to listen to his music since I found out he came out on Instagram. It kinda sucks because he is honestly my favorite male singer. I can't explain it, but it just makes me feel sad and I just find myself skipping over his songs when I'm listening to music on my phone. I've known for a long time (after doing some research on Purple Sky and watching God knows how many interviews, I just always suspected) that he was probably gay, but now that he's confirmed it himself, I don't know... And I know it's not a homophobic thing. I myself am a member of the LGBT+ community. But I do know that he's the reason I took up playing the piano and he is still my favorite male singer, but I can't seem to enjoy his music anymore. I've only listened to one song one time since he came out and that was Meridians, like two days ago. I honestly don't know what's wrong with me.",0.9585,196

"This really help me through my depression.And really make me feel i have a remedy for it and that sometimes when you don't know where to go you have to.think of all the people that love you.Because, I've been hurt as well and sonetimes I don't know where to go. Yes, im only 11 but I've been through hell and this song reminds me why i don't take my own life and, its as if that dark mirror and reflection is my heart filled with depth and sorrow and is slowy fading so fast yet so slow by yet I cant catch .it fast enough to heal it because I've broken it to many times and know it's lost in the deep never-ending ebis called my heart and soul im at the point in my life when I've been bullied so hard i have no self meaning you see, constructive comments like its okay and etc . Never really help the pain and only hurts mire because I'll have to fake a smile and hurt even more people and my bestfriend doesn't even know how to help me because, I've never even told her . You can say it'll get better but in the end words are just word point less and never meaning just like me .",-0.9728,225

Verse 2 reminds me of my last relationship. Broke up because I didn't want my depression to get in the way bc that's what happened the first time we broke up. So, I went through this big phase change by myself and I think I'm slowly getting ready to hear ""I love you"" again.",0.8743,95
