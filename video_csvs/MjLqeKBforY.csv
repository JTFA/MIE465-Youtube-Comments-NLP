Hi Mr. Chris, I found your channel a few days ago and I've managed to watched every single one of your videos on YouTube haha. You really inspire me. I'm 16 and I haven't had any clue of what I want to do later on but I've never even entertained the idea of going into special ed teaching but you really inspire me to do that and now i think I'm going to pursue that in college. I want to change people like you've changed me. Thank you so much for making these videos and kind of opening everyone's eyes to the reality and diversity of people with different conditions and helping us all understand what it's like and how to interact if we're unsure. Everyone deserves love no matter what :)",0.9839,146

"I’m currently a Medicine student in Spain. I’m always being told that I won’t be able to become a doctor because I’m in a wheelchair, and that I should study something else ‘if I want to succeed in life’. This last year has been a bit difficult for me, and I really started to believe for myself that I will never succeed. 
But some months ago, I found SBSK. All those friends out there have helped me so much in gaining more confidence. I now know that I shouldn’t let other people decide what I can try or what not. I no longer define success in terms of accomplishment; for me, it’s trying hard in pursuing what makes me happy. And something that would make me feel fulfilled is become a doctor to let all my patients know that I not only see their disease or disability. That I see them as sensible persons with feelings and wishes, chasing their dreams as any other one would also do.

"This is the continuation of my life story-
As time passed, the chances of my survival were low. The doctors told my mom that I would never be able to speak or eat on my own. I was very premature, but my mom refused to give up on me. Thanks to to prayers and her faith in God, I slowly got stronger. My mom would feed me small amounts of liquid until one day the doctors examined me to see how things were going regarding my situation of being fed through a tube in my stomach. The doctor fed me a bottle of water, and when she noticed the water was going down normally, she was shocked. It was a miracle! I could eat through my mouth like normal now! That was one step closer to overcoming my challenges.
Next, was my mom’s persistent attempts to teach me to talk. She spent day after day talking to me, teaching me, aiding me in speaking for the first time because she knew that was something I could do no matter what the doctors previously told her. Eventually, I spoke! And look at me now, I am bilingual. It’s still a challenge, sometimes. But I did what everyone said I would never be able to do. I speak, I live, I persevere my dreams.
In High School, I was bullied. I would tell them to stop, to leave me alone, but they never listened. I told my teachers and the principal, and they told them to stop. Since then, they have stopped. I spoke up, and got the help I needed. I ended up graduating from Rosemead High School, class of 2014. After that, I attended El Monte School. I stayed for a couple of months, but I had a lot of problems there with a mean teacher. Then, I went to Mexico to take a break from all that drama. I stayed for a while, had my fun, distracted myself from that school problem. One day, my sister Karla called my mom and told her to find another school to go to. That is when we found LIFT North.
Ever since I switched schools, I gained some awesome friends and got rid of the drama, thanks to my awesome family and friends who helped me through that hard time. I was then introduced to Mr. Michael and the Academy of Special Dreams. I have since joined them and attend their current events. So a big Thank You to the Academy of Special Dreams who have changed my life. I want to join in I am special needs",0.9954,502

You and your friends are an inspiration to me and everyone.  Thank you thank you thank you Chris....and I hope you find me a friends as well.  My daughter has a deletion in her Chromosome.  She looks a little different then most.  She is my inspiration and Angel.  She has a two year old and is the best mother.  She is 22 years old and I cant believe it!  The medical doctors told me that she may end up in a vegetated state and lose muscle control as she grew.  That was not the case.   She went to oral facial clinic from the time she was one until 21.  She has had Chromosome testing and so has her little mini me.  She does not have her deletion as her mother.   She was High Risk when she was pregnant. While in the womb Skylinn had a microarray testing to do chromosome testing which goes into all the nooks and crannies of every chromosome (to say it more simply.)  Emily had that done when Skylinn was in the womb in Frederick.  This showed that she didnt have the same chromosome problem as Emily but then her doctor did say that she did  have some junk on her Second Chromosome.  Which usually was something with the face and then another with her cognitive skills.  They told us this could be very small or nothing at all.  She was born and she was beautiful.  The only thing we can see is that she has a small underbite like Emily and her ears stick out very far....which we love cause it adds to her cuteness..She is so cute and rotten...lol  But she for the most part is all good!!  I know that time will tell with other things but so far so good.  Now they did tell her that if she was to get pregnant again that it may not go the same way or it might.  We put her in Gods hands the minute we knew she was there.  Emily has a great and pure faith.  But no matter what...even if there were other things we would love her just the same!   Love your video's and Love you !!  Bless you for all you do and the way people...these Souls can tell it like it is and be happier knowing they say their peace...xoxoxo Chris and love also to all you Beautiful Souls!!!!!
