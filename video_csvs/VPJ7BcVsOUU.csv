"Could you do a video about hairstyles and tips for growing your hair out? I had hair to my waist, had to cut it because the ends were damaged, then made the mistake of going to the wrong person to dye my hair and it got fried so it was breaking at 2 inches long and had to cut all my hair off. (That was 8 months ago and I still cry about it.) Then as it was growing I decided to get an undercut because my hair had to grow anyway, and now most of my hair is to my chin and the undercut is about 2 inches long. My hair looks like a 1920's flapper and I have no idea what to do with it. If you could give some advice on how to make it through the growing out stages especially during the holidays when so many pictures are taken, I would be so grateful and so would my self esteem.",-0.5529,178
