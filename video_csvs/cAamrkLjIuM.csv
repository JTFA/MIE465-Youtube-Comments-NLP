"Hi people, read carefully this post because  is really important!  The movie is called Pandas by IMAX cited in this article:  http://www.unionleader.com/Chinese-bears-put-NH-naturalist,-the-Granite-State-in-the-spotlight is in the work by the same people behind the He Sheng death, the global cause foundation, hired by Chengdu panda base, these are an americans group of researchers that are using a method used for release black bears in the wild. This method involve a direct contact with pandas, cuddling them, teach them to eat bambo (this is done by a panda mum, not by a human in the wild!!!) giving them food that they can't find alone in the wild, because in the wild pandas eat at 99% bamboo, certainly not apples and basically is a method totally wrong for the pandas, because pandas are not black bears! This method has already caused the death of a panda! But the worse thing is the direct contact, Wolong panda base has already established in the past that direct human contact with pandas trained to be released in the wild is a bad thing, and indeed they changed this approach, starting to use panda suits to avoid to be recognizable by the pandas as humans. In this way they can teach them to properly avoid any possible danger in the wild, humans included, and this method actually works, Wolong panda base has 7 pandas succesfully released and living in the wild, with Tao Tao released in 2012 and perfectly fine still these days! They are training Qian Qian too, but this panda is 4 years old age and usually 2 or 3 years is the proper age to relase a panda in the wild because he/she can be accepted by the group of wild pandas, over this age, the success of integration will diminish. Now we want to show to Chengdu panda base and global cause foundation that we are very upset for what they're doing with the pandas, right ? Good, If you agree with me, please consider the option to boycott this movie, don't go to the cinema to watch it, share this post everywhere and tell to all your friends to do the same, don't give money to these people, you have the power to do a right thing, don't support all the lies that Chengdu panda base has told to chinese fans for many, many months about many aspects of the management of the pandas, from the enclosure N°14, where they keep pandas and is too small for them, they insisted that this enclosure is good, according to the regulations for the pandas enclosures, but this is proved to be false, to continue with the mites problems that many pandas seems to suffer in the base because they bundle too many pandas in the same enclosure and this can favor the spread of diseases and infections.Too many lies to accept! But in this cause our voice can be heard, only in this way you can make a difference, you can make our voice louder and be sure that all together we can change the bad things that are happening in the pandas world, but we need to stay all cohesively and together in this fight. Please, please, please, share this post with all your friends who loves pandas and please boycott this movie, don't go to the cinema because if you do, you indirectly fund what they're doing, totally wrong, with the pandas! And you'll be guilty too.",0.8648,641
