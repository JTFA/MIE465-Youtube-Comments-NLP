"Dear Hazel, 
As a young woman and filmmaker my eyes lit up to see this on my feed. It's wonderful to see that a director/content creator from our community here, will collaborate with Hollywood actors across the pond and have the same united sense of women's empowerment and passion in film. Even to touch on the subject is refreshing. And especially with a one of a kind franchise like PP (that not only passes the Bechtel test AND has many strong female leads but their main goal is not finding a man). Also great to see this vid as it stands out from all the other press that inherently ask the same questions. This episode of tispy talk should be a feature! I would back it myself but being a young woman in film I don't have the money... ;p 
Best! Kim xx",0.9755,157
