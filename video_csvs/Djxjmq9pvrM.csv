Playstation VR is actually really good gift. The games are cool aswell very virtually real. But can be expensive the games. My husband actually got as a gift from his job.

"Random.. But, thought of this instantly. Use to work at Toys R Us for years in my teens. The models they use on 90% of packaging for toys look WAY beyond the age of the demographic they should aim for and that definitely are not shopping at toy stores for much else than gaming gear or electronics. Barbie, NERF, and the pre-packaged crafting kits come to mind as the worst perpetrators. Young people who looked almost my age (16/17/18 or so) with clip in colored streaks, early 2000’s Disney Chanel style layered clothing, silly makeup for the female models, and a stupid, over the top expression for all!! Every time I see Nerf/Nerf Rebelle I tense up at how weird it is. Maybe it’s the way their eyes scream ‘dead inside’ while simultaneously looking like they’re also saying “thumbs up, dude!!” without even somehow making a thumbs up????",-0.9067,186
