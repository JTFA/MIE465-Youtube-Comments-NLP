"don't worry about North Korea, that's the distraction, the real world war 3 will be spiked by venezuela and billionaire Farc guerrilla group taking over Latin America's top allies in the coming elections. As you see a global rise in leftist marxist popullism spread like a virus worldwide due to income inequality, venezuela's inflation rate is projected to exceed 2300% in 2018. In all of recorded human history, there has only been one socialist nation that has succeeded: The next one.

The next steps for the nation are hyperinflation followed by revolution. When the cost of feeding your family exceeds a certain percentage of your income, the risk/reward of revolution tips in favor of war. This is because the risk of dying in a battle is less than the risk of starving to death if you don't have a revolution. Both Hugo Chavez and Maduro got elected by promising a free lunch to their populations. Sound familiar? A war is coming, is just won't happen for a few more years, the first event that will take place will be an economic dotcom bubble 2.0 in the cryptomarket, but don't worry, that won't happen this year either, in fact, world war 3 will only last 8 minutes.
