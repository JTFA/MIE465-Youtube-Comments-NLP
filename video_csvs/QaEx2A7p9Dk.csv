"Como a geada em uma rosa
O inverno vem para todos n√≥s
Oh, como a natureza nos conhece
Com a natureza da paci√™ncia
Como uma semente na neve
Fui enterrado para crescer
Por sua promessa √© leal
De semente a sequ√≥ia

eu sei

CORO:
Embora o inverno seja longo at√© mais rico
A colheita traz
Embora minha espera se prolongue ainda mais
Sua promessa para mim como uma semente
Eu acredito que minha temporada vir√°

Senhor, eu penso em seu amor
Como o sol de inverno baixo
Enquanto olho, estou cego
√Ä luz do seu brilho
Como um fogo para a neve
Estou renovado em seu calor
Derreta o gelo desta alma selvagem
At√© o est√©ril √© lindo

Posso ver a promessa
Posso ver o futuro
Voc√™ √© o Deus das esta√ß√µes
Estou apenas no inverno
Se eu souber da colheita
Isso vale a pena minha paci√™ncia
Ent√£o, se voc√™ n√£o est√° pronto a trabalhar
Deus, eu n√£o terminei esperando

Voc√™ pode ver minha promessa
Mesmo no inverno
Porque voc√™ √© o Deus da grandeza
Mesmo em uma manjedoura

Por tudo o que sei das esta√ß√µes
√â voc√™ que leva seu tempo
Voc√™ poderia ter nos salvado em um segundo
Em vez disso, voc√™ enviou uma crian√ßa

E quando eu finalmente vejo minha √°rvore
Ainda acredito que h√° uma temporada por vir

Como uma semente, voc√™ foi semeada
Pelo bem de todos n√≥s
Do solo de Bel√©m
Greu Calvary's sequoia",0.1531,248

Thats the thing tho, being buried is hard sometimes, especially when it is snowing....cos any hope of a seed growing in such conditions seems impossible, much like our circumstances, but yet thats where our greatest miracles lie, cos if he is not done working then we should not be done waiting.....but none the less it still feels hard, and it is difficult to hold onto our faith in the midst of our storms, but theres beauty of these worship songs, much like his word, they remind us to hold on, our God is greater and stronger, and able, and all of this is working for my good..........If you reading this Listen to Your Promises by Elevation Worship, there is power in those lyrics, touches me every time.",0.9858,176
