Got an idea for a commercial. Have a commercial where someone walks up to a mirror and there‚Äôs a monster behind him. whenever he turns around to check (the monster is only in the mirror) the monster would get closer While still promoting the app. (The monster is only in the mirror though),0.3612,62
