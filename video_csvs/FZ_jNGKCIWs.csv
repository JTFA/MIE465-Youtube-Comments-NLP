Seems like just a way for pharmaceuticals to make more money.
I am not against all vaccines, we did manage to pretty much nuke polio and small pox, but the track record on flu shots hasn't been as good, and I don't bother with them, as a lot of years I don't even get the flu, and the worst I get when I do catch it maybe once in a year is pretty much like just having a short-term cold.

"For the comments that state, the flu shot is not useful because you have never contracted the flu and you didn't receive the flu shot, that is a bad example and your personal experience is not empirical evidence. I don't like that flu shot ether but I have researched it quite a bit and have many scientific based reasons.  One reason is that the CDC shows statistics of effectiveness from year to year and the rate is generally below a %50 efficacy rate. If you track the rate at which a population contracts a cold, the statistics would look similar. Some people are going to get it, and some people aren't. A vaccine should not be less effective than it is effective with so much advertising after 40 years of collaboration. BigPharma and other corporations like CVS always push things that will harm a population; because their goal is making money, creating a customer, and using scare tactics. That is true with a great deal of many drugs. The flu may provide partial immunity whether it is the correct strain or not but if that is true then why get a shot every year that is proven inefficient? It certainly lowers your immunity at a time that you are most likely vulnerable which is why you feel aches and pains afterwards.

"I'm no dummy when it comes to vaccines, but there is one question that is NEVER addressed on these videos about the flu vaccines. You see, herd immunity is a great and real thing with vaccines. The problem is that herd immunity does not really take effect unless ~95% of the population is vaccinated. However, each year, only 150 million flu shots are produced and they take months to make them. So even if every one of those is taken, that is still only 50% coverage well below what herd immunity needs. 

So, I am a healthy individual who almost never gets the flu and, if I do once every ~5 years, it is mild and clears up in about a day. I always figured it was immoral for me TO get a flu shot because there are a limited number of shots available every season and, if I take one, that is one less than a more needing person can get. Flu Vaccine shortages happen all the time.

If someone lives or works with vulnerable people then they definitely should get a shot. However, the system is just not set up for widespread herd immunity. Now if we want to *change* the system so that there are enough shots for everyone and get the entire population flu vaccinated, I could get behind that. (Though they should then be covered for free if you want that to work) Till then, give my shot to someone more needing of it. Enjoy the shot. :-)",-0.3032,287
I'm not an anti-vaxxer but In song believe the flu shot is effective. The past two years the flu shot has accurately predicted the flu virus in 11% and 10% of the time.

Other research is finding that vaccine aluminum nanoparticulates (not in flu vaccines generally, but many other vaccines) are getting to the brain via immune system cells.

"Slight correction in regards to how the flu exit an infected cell. They do not ‚Äúburst‚Äù open a cell. Instead, they incorporate themselves within the bilayer of the host cell membrane. From there, they exit the cell by a process called ‚Äúbudding‚Äù. This allows the virus to possess the necessary proteins on its capsid (Hemagglutinin & Neurominidase) that are used to infect new cells. It‚Äôs essentially like a wolf in sheep skin. It‚Äôs hypothesized that neurominidase is a protein used for glucose absorption into the cell. So when the virus exploits such a protein, the cell welcomes it into its membrane believing the virus is glucose. And because everyone expresses slightly altered forms of these proteins, the virus is ever so slightly different from the original one that infected the cell it originated from. A process known as antigenic drift. This process of budding is what drugs like Relenza and Amantidine target to prevent further replication. It prevents the virus from budding thus reducing the viral load. However, a similar phenomenon known as antigenic shift also occurs seldomly. This is where the virus genetic variation becomes substantially altered and can contain new genes that allow the virus to cross species. These particular strains are important because their virulence and pathogenicity are greatly increased and allow it spread much more rapidly.",0.4201,250

"What a misleading video. Thumbs down for sure. Check this other YouTube video from Suzzane Humphries, an MD who has researched vaccines in depth for years, explaining what the flu vaccine does to you: https://youtu.be/jt9rdznYsLI. You should also take a look at this YouTube channel Vaxxed TV to get a better idea of what a vaccine can do to you and your loved ones.

Now, you also have to look at the package insert for every vaccine you decide to inject into your body and/or your children. For instance, I took this excerpt below from the Afluria Influenza vaccine packet insert that you can find online on the FDA's website. The postmarketing experience section lists adverse reactions reported after receiving the vaccine. Those cases were so numerous that reactions made it into the package insert. Just the neurological disorders alone are scary enough for me to deny this shot. Thank you. Keep it to yourself.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience
Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. The adverse reactions described have been included in this section because they: 1) represent reactions that are known to occur following immunizations generally or influenza immunizations specifically; 2) are potentially serious; or 3) have been reported frequently. These adverse reactions reflect experience in both children and adults and include those identified during post-approval use of AFLURIA outside the US since 1985.

Blood and lymphatic system disorders
Thrombocytopenia

Immune system disorders
Allergic or immediate hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock and serum sickness

Nervous system disorders
Neuralgia, paresthesia, convulsions (including febrile seizures), encephalomyelitis,
encephalopathy, neuritis or neuropathy, transverse myelitis, and GBS

Vascular disorders
Vasculitis which may be associated with transient renal involvement

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Pruritus, urticaria, and rash

General disorders and administration site conditions
Cellulitis and large injection site swelling
Influenza-like illness",-0.9633,363

"What this video doesn't tell you is that it takes 2 weeks for the vaccine to full effect in your system. If you got sick shortly after the shot it is because you already had the virus in your system, you got a strain that the vaccine didn't protect you against, or it was because the vaccine still didn't take the full effect in your system. The vaccine works. It just doesn't work against the virus was in the human body for a couple days when you do get it and doesn't protect you against all strains.",-0.8429,103
What's the connection between a flu shot and frozen shoulder? My mom got the flu shot on her right arm and then developed frozen shoulder on her right arm. Next year she got the flu shot on the other side and frozen shoulder happened on that side as well. I heard from our family doctor that in rare cases the flu shot could cause frozen shoulder but was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences?,-0.6136,79

"You don't sound as if you're aware of recent research finding that those vaccinated against influenza release up to 6 times more contagious fine viral particulates now believed to be contagious?  Nor the research finding the vaccinated more susceptible to other respiratory infections, and increasingly susceptible to pandemic strains and longer infections if they've taken the flu shot in prior years.  I personally have already sacrificed more than my share of health, life expectancy, and overall well-being in the name of experiencing various pharma-phantasized ""contributions"" to humanity, I now understand the overall character of petro-based medicine and the global pharma cartels, and I'm pretty sure on top of not sacrificing more for pharma's BOGUS gods of disease prevention, I'm actually doing MORE for ""the herd"" if I don't take any vaccine, but the flu shot is clearly one of the worst ""recommended.""",-0.7329,158

Ethylmercury is not a vaccination component.
