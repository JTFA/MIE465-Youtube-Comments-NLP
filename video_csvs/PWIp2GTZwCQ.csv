"Fantastic video. I'm an introvert who has always been treated as though it is fault. As though I am damaged and I could simply paste together the broken peices. I've always excelled with school and have watched those around me become intimidated simply by the way that I speak. This is course came from overly analysing my self and then later hearing another say such things about me, without them knowing that I've analyzed it.
 Truly, I could continue but I know long messages make it so many will not read or reply. Though there are those that do and will.",-0.1154,110

As part of the presentation I have to critique the research and suggest other ways it could be looked at. I think your video is the key to my critique! I am going to look into introvert/extrovert differences in term of the activation you mentioned and try and apply that to the research I am presenting on.
