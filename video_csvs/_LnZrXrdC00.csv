"I have this opinion about FPGAs and FPGA-like tools.  I've seen engineers pour far too much time and effort into them.  I really think 90% of the time when people try solving an issue with something with an FPGA/CPLD or hybrid proecessor, using a different processor altogether would be better.",0.6486,57
"I hurt a little inside on the windows  switch, but another good video nonetheless. I loved the positive message in the end.

I understand the rage of the price increase, and there is a fine line of a company's ability to increase a price to sustain it's business and employees. I think what you pay for when you ultimately buy a prepackaged solution is the guarantee. (Most) companies will work for you to ensure their service is provided, so while a hacked together solution will work, it will be tough to be used in any production environment.

Ultimately we are just paying for silicon, metal, plastic and some other assortments of materials and I think that the real value lies from the logic, assembly and time people put into the product, whether that's the design decisions or the functional pipeline.

"I'm not sure how Saleae thought this price hike was a good idea... It's like the reverse of what jlink did in introducing ""edu"" levels of their hardware (since they're raising the price instead of lowering...): pricing tiers on identical hardware seem contrived... Not sure what the thought process was (make it more expensive so it seems more valuable? Something else investor driven?)   but it seems like a lousy idea unless they were already selling (the newer fpga-based units) below cost... They probably lost another sale here...",-0.4358,102

MadyWinter the fx2 is a 8051 core and the fx3 supposedly ARM9 so probably no,-0.3566,16
"Might also been nice as a logic analyzer for vintage computer repair where there's wide parallel buses that could use the full 32 bit width of the GPIF system. Guessing that application would need a buffer like http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Open_Bench_Logic_Sniffer has (for only 16/32 channels). Since it seems the FX3 has a max input voltage of Vcc+0.3, or ~3.6V.",0.6486,66
"Nice work. If you really wanted to get something up and running quickly with Sigrok, you could check out supported Sigrok analysers to see how they write their data and emulate that, but it's easier if Sigrok can support your device directly. There's also the Beaglebone Logic analyser, 100Msps, just a bit more expensive but your one would be way more compact. It might have taken weeks if you went the old fashion way, MCU (or CPLD) with SRAM with a USB interface (limited sample depth would be a pain).",0.8689,103

"Saleae has to make money somehow and that's by offering a great product at a decent price. I based a piece of production test equipment off one of their Logic16 units and while it was quite pricey for what it was, it worked and their software was the only thing that justified the price. When I went to update the tester they had discontinued the Logic 16 and replaced it with the more expensive Logic16 Pro which offered me new nothing I wanted and broke up the input ports which I didn't want. That made me craft a complete replacement written on the PRU of a Beaglebone. Bye Saleae!!! Now with this price gouge I'm very glad I ditched them. Saleae, you've completely alienated me.",0.9198,138
"Seems like an act of desperation. To me, this looks like the beginning of the end of Saleae.",0.25,21
So I have owned a Saleae for about a decade and love their product/software.  Now I am thinking about trying out this DreamSourceLab product you pointed out as the analog performance looks great!  How have you liked yours?  I wonder if there are any other products I should also consider?

Thought the first logic 8 was overpriced. Essentially a $10 cypress dev board.

"Yes, hard drive or CD-ROM. Basically it needs to be able to grab 16 bits of data and 4-5 more signals fast enough(I don't remember exactly how many), sending data from disk to controller shouldn't be a problem at all. UDMA/33 mode would be good enough for such device.",0.7549,59
