And you studied physics where? Do you realize that the principles of rocket flight are demonstrated again and again by students in university laboratories? I suppose all of them are in on the deception? Talk about silly nonsense.,-0.7219,42

"Rockets actually perform slightly better in a vacuum. They don't move by pushing against air - the air simply moves out of the way. Rockets produce thrust by the combustion pushing against the front of the combustion chamber. The open nozzle in back allows gasses to escape in that direction, causing the rocket to move in the opposite direction.",0.5118,64
