She seems to go along with what the public of the era generally think, rather than having too many deep-seated prejudices herself.  

For example, she officially condemned her uncle for marrying a divorcee.  But she was personally sympathetic when Princess Margaret wanted to marry a divorcee (even though the public weren't - which meant the Queen had to threaten consequences if Princess Margaret married him).  Her kids then got divorced without her disowning them, and she gave her blessings to both Charles and Harry marrying a divorcee (since the public were more accepting of divorce by then).

Charles was officially expected by her to marry a virgin - but then his sons have been openly sleeping with their girlfriends prior to marriage, etc., without losing any status with the Queen (since the public don't really care these days).",-0.4572,190
