"Dear Troye, I'm 26, I went through the whole 90s boy and girl band thing. I always laughed at the idea of screaming fangirls like the ones you see in old Beatles videos.  I've went to countless concerts and met at least 20 celebrities artists. I've been nervous and excited but never completely fanboyed too hardcore. You're is someone new to me that I stumbled on and I'm completely obsessed. The voice, the look and the overall vibe that you put off? HELL YES. I can see myself losing my sh*t at your concerts or meeting. I feel weird and confused how you hit a chord with me so differently. Thanks for reaching a feeling and part of me I didn't think I had. You're the freaking bomb dude, and as attractive as you are talented! Keep killing it!",-0.9154,157

"Lyrics 






[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

[Verse 2]
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my

[Bridge]
Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
