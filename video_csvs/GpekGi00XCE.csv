"Brilliant lookbook, loved every single bit of it! It also looks achievable, sometimes I feel like YouTubers deliberately try to dress as pretentiously as possible to make sure that others would not steal ideas. As a student on a budget, I feel like this sort of approach allows me to dress the way I like AND not spend a fortune on it! Also, I absolutely loved the Boxing Day bit of the video, it looked so natural and genuine! Good job Hannah. x",0.9853,93
