"Normal amount of time humans can hold their breath is around 30 to 50 seconds without any training.
Those people who got under 20 seconds might want to go and see a doctor just in case. Unless they are under the age. Then it is understandable.
With enough training though. You can hold your breath easily over 2 minutes.
Which i could do before but after i stopped my swimming classes it has gone down to about 1:30 sadly. Anything over that will just give me a headache and make me light headed.",-0.6369,101
