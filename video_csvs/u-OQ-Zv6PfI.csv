"Great video and I love your jumper!

I know you've tried lots of things for your lips so my suggestions are probably nothing new, but on days when they're just dry pile on a shedload of vaseline (from the big petroleum jelly tubs not the little lip tins as the lip ones tend to be thinner/less moisturising) and let it gradually sink into the lips to restore the moisture.  On days when your lips are sore as well as dry I'd definitely recommend Aveeno products - they're great on sensitive, irritated skin and will moisturise whilst also soothing.  I've been using the moisturising cream ever since my eczema badly flared up a few years ago and it's a miracle worker for soothing sore, cracked skin :)",0.9744,136

"Heya Lily, nice video. Thank you so much because is always good to see what stays on peoples staple list from year to year consistently disregarding the hype of many things. Makes us also trust those brands and try those products. Also funny how you and Anna are so alike with basically the same favourites XD haha
  
As for sunscreen protection I discoverd this year my favourite of all time is the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF50+/PA++++ (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Biore-Aqua-Watery-Essence-SPF50/dp/B01MTDFFQ5/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1516027831&sr=8-1&keywords=biore+aqua+rich+watery+essence)

I love it for many reasons, for the broad spectrum coverage, for the watery texture and the price. It protects the skin firmly from strong ultraviolet rays, and prevents spots and freckles due to sunburn. They say it even protects you if you sweat, even if you touch the water, super waterproof type resistant (as confirmed in the water resistance test over 80 minutes), you can drop it with usual soap, facial cleanser and body wash. Because it adheres smoothly to the skin, it is also a makeup base. It has a Veil containing UV-cut ingredients will stay firmly on your skin.",0.9897,210

Hi Lily! Do you wear the spf under the moisturizer? Or just do one?,0.0,17
Hi Lily! Great video. Have you ever tried putting Aquaphor on your eyes and lips? I know you’ve mentioned dry skin around your eyes and mouth before and I think Aquaphor could really help you! It’s a heavy duty balm and there’s very few ingredients that one could be allergic to. I put it on my eyes and lips before bed and I highly recommend!!!,0.8706,79
"Hi Lily! I know that you've been loving the Oskia gel for the past years but I've only dare to try it recently (I'm always late to the party). I wanted to ask you: do you use it for your eye make up as well? It says not to but I'm a lazy person and I feel tempted to use it all over my face!  By the way I have started trying the Ceramidin cream (following your advice) and I've found they sell little tubes for 14 € hat are perfect to try, maybe other people find that interesting. 
Love your videos!",0.9591,114
Hi Lily! I really loved your style of editing in this video! Are you planning on doing any interior videos?,0.6982,23

Maybe you already switched your toothpaste but if you didn’t yet, I cannot recommand enough you do so. It is the best thing you can do for your lips. I use toothpaste without SLS and without fluoride from Weleda and it transformed my dry/ flaky/ itchy/ sore lips into a juicy mouth 💋 With love from the Netherlands 🙋🏻‍♀️",0.8805,95

I suddenly had a reaction to some of the crazy rumours natural lip balms. My lips were swollen and felt burned. I didn't realise for a month that it was a reaction and one morning I just clicked as I was putting the lip balm on. I looked into other balms and the best reviewed was NUXE revue de mile ultra nourishing lip balm. It soothed my lips instantly and took maybe two or three days for my lips to feel normal again. It's a great balm and so gentle.....maybe you should try it. £9.50 xx,0.872,105

It was really good to see you’d actually used loads of the products you were talking about. Sometimes monthly favourites come round so quick people have only used the thing for such a short time but they obviously need to talk about something different to last month. The Pillow Talk lipstick was one of my favourites this year too. I must check out the Cream Colour Base!,0.3375,73

"Lots of CT in my favourites video this year too! Just so you're aware, Glossier Balm Dotcom contains petrolatum (aka petroleum jelly like Vaseline) which isn't at all hydrating. It's a barrier product which is good to protect from the wind, but it actually contributes to lips drying out so you might feel the need to reapply it much more often. I'm a big fan of their flavours anyway but just thought I'd pass it on given your dry lip issues! x",0.7772,90

Shades between the 2:
Creme Brulee - fair with a light pink undertone
Cannelle - light with a peachy undertone
Honey - warm peach tone for light to medium complexion",0.8878,90

"Ooh Lily, yellow is beautiful on you!
I don’t normally comment, but after hearing you’ve been struggling with  sore, dry lips for 2 years (from a Maybelline lip product, yes?), I couldn’t help myself.
My best friend has had chronic dermatitis/soreness/generally dry and cracked lips for longer than I can remember, but recently started seeing a new dermatologist, who prescribed 1/2 the lowest dose of roaccutane to treat it (although she does not currently, and never has had acne), and after 4 months, it cleared up completely!
I know this is certainly not a one-cure-fits-all scenario - and that oral acne medication can have horrible side effects - but I thought it was so bizarre and unconventional to go down that route that it might be worth mentioning, if you haven’t spoken with someone about it already. 
Good luck, and thanks for a lovely round up of 2017.
