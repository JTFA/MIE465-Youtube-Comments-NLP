"Nice nice. FYI, tesla doesnt have dealers, it has showrooms and service centers. And it has not put a single Tesla model 3 on display yet, ANYWHERE in the nation or in the world. I live near Fremont (its headquarters) and have only sat in one through a friend of mine working at tesla. You can only sit in a model s and model x in the showrooms. So You are blatantly lying by saying you found one in a tesla ""dealer"" (even if you meant showroom, you would be lying as no model 3's are on display). Yikes. There have only been 3 tesla model 3's sold  in maryland as of writing this comment. Since I have been in touch with the car manufacturing industry, I would like to let you know there are always problems in the first few thousand cars, albeit any brand. It is showing even in the model 3's as they are improving with every iteration. Generally there are magnet issues in the lid in the center console or an issue with panel aligning by a few millimeters. It is very normal for a newly released car. For a fair comparison, check You You Xue and his review. He has had some issues including autopilot, software glitches and audio ticks, but the interior according to him is great. The majority of owners in forums, and also reviewers who have been critical of Tesla before think the interior is simple but high quality. Check out Doug Demuro's review for example, who I think is fairly neutral when it comes to Tesla's, not shying away from pointing out flaws in it. Even he thinks that the interior is high quality.
BTW please do research before lying. That was too easy for me and very satisfying.
BTW part II: I will keep replying not because I am irritated, but because, as mentioned previously (since you failed to read my explanation), I am amused by your laziness and lack of attention and overall stupidity when having a discussion, as you resort to bland and unclever insults when you are out of points to make as you cannot accept another person's opinions and observations.

As for the Model 3's interior, I have actually sat in a Model 3 at a Tesla dealer in Betheada MD. It's far worse than a mid grade Toyota Camry which can be had for half the price. The Model 3 is also being delivered with body panel fitment issues. That's a 1980's type manufacturing issue. Quality control at Tesla is a major issue and it shouldn't  be on a $50,000+ car. But maybe you think that's acceptable. Now please stop being butt-hurt when someone points out a legitimate issue with a Tesla. But if you want to keep responding to me then...well, I know it's because you're easily irritated. Best of luck with the counseling.",0.7464,192

"Robert Blackford yeah much cheaper to have a computer controlled electric glove box, mirrors, air vents, etc then to put plastic handles on them. Makes sense lmao",0.7269,31
"Robert Blackford, always the people who do not know much come at people with statements about not posting on things you do not know. The Model S and Model X handle great, especially considering NEITHER ONE IS A SPORTS CAR and both seat five adults and up to either two more kids or two more adults...Is there a family sedan that can beat the Model S around the famous German track? Maybe? But the actual thing that slows down the Model S on a track like the Nurburgring is that the battery pack cannot keep the batteries cool enough for a top speed run the full way around it, the handling is not the issue. Again, LARGE HEAVY FAMILY  SEDAN, not really designed to compete with sports cars, even though it crushes them in short straight line races. 

That said, the Model S for all of its wonders does not have the newest battery pack design and the newest batteries from the Gigafactory, and the Model 3 does have those. Reports are that Model 3 can maintain top speed (140 mph) for extended periods of time and repeated hard accelerations without complaint. So I expect the Model 3, still a family sedan, to do quite nicely at the Nurburgring. Reports so far also state there is basically NO body roll when cornering in a Model 3, and I did not mention the superior braking because of the regen braking yet, which is also a huge advantage if you want to get around a track as fast as possible. 

There is only so much design can do. The center of gravity for EVs is naturally lower, as is the drag because of the flat bottom, as is the braking because they can use the motors as generators with regen braking, slowing the car much more quickly and avoiding overheating the brakes. Higher center of gravity means you have to take turns at a lower speed, that is just physics. The speed of improvement at Tesla is blinding, so any sane person would realize that there is no chance ICE cars can match these improvements. 

When the new Tesla Roadster, their first from the ground up mature technology sports car, comes out in 2019 or 2020 and there is a road legal ICE car even remotely close to the time it can do at the Nurburgring, then I will admit I do not know as much as I think. But I expect the new Roadster to crush the previous best ever time by a large margin.",0.9531,463

lots of comments on the hosts poor verbal performance but he was clearly blown away by the car and rendered speechless. In his write up he admits to being an old school gear head that needs the sound and vibration of an ICE to feel like he's going fast.,0.8201,51
"maerklin29800 Well, I happen to like the smell of gasoline and don't find it at all to ""stink"", but I digress.  Plus, what do you mean by ""really feal the road?""  Last I checked I was capable of listening to a good engine and ""feeling the road"" at the same time.  For comparison, imagine playing a board game, but instead of rolling the dice you use an electronic dice roller that just picks a random number for you.  Sure it helps you focus on something else, but does it add to the experience or take away from it.  Of course the answer should be that it takes away from it.  The dice is part of the experience.  Same story with the sound a car's  engine makes, it is part of the experience.  I would take a Mazda Miata, Shelby GT 350, or Porsche GT4 over a whisper quiet electric car any day of the week!  I'll stop and pull over later to look at the trees.",0.9663,192

"oof calm down sir. I just keep replying to try and see if I could change your mind. Apparently you are very rigid when it comes to a proper discussion and debate. And its fun replying when you know you are going to be entertained by the responders self contradictions. Again by trying to gauge my persona, you are making a personal attack rather than discussing the point, ie, Tesla's interior. Its honestly very amusing to see you struggle to muster up a reply and try to personally critique me while contradicting yourself time and time again. How you have given up on trying to have a civil discussion about the point and have digressed to try and conjure up personal insults like calling me a liar and caring about how I feel. My point is, please next time try to be objective and civil while discussing with a person with viewpoints other than yours. Not everyone disagreeing with you is an enemy. Stop being so narrow minded and regressive.",-0.4215,184

"sullyFL , must be why it way outperforms anything Apple or Microsoft makes in terms of speed of responsiveness. You do realize that 60% of their automotive staff are SOFTWARE ENGINEERS, right?

"tomo3333 I don't doubt that you have fun in your Model S.  For crying out loud, it does 0 to 60 somewhere around 3 seconds (in higher trims.)  It's the handling department that is subjective.  Disclaimer, I have never driven any Tesla before, however I do know some statistics.  Especially with weight.  The model s especially is VERY heavy in comparison to comparable cars, so I would imagine that you would feel it's weight around corners.  Another point regarding ""Tesla Fanboys.""  Notice the jk (just kidding) I put at the end.  This recognizes that almost all major car companies have their fanboys, for good or for bad.  I'm glad you personally care about driving, because most Tesla enthusiasts don't.  Rather they are technology enthusiasts and could  care less about driving.  As I said in my original comment, buy what you want to buy.  If you like what Tesla is offering... GREAT, buy it (that's capitalism for you!) However for me personally,  it's about the experience.  The sound of a good engine, the lack of technology (meaning just you and the car,) and a good road make for an experience that no electric car could ever match.",0.9816,234
"tribalypredisposed But it sounds like a 0 cylinder, and that's no fun.  You have a point with instant torque and accleration, but your wrong as far as claiming that taking almost every button away in a car is brilliant.  Making it so you have look at your screen for EVERY major function change is not intuitive, it's trendy.  Honda made the same mistake when customers complained about too many buttons in their cars infotainment systems.  And their solution... get rid of ALL the buttons!  I as well as other customers complained that it was inconvenient, distracting, and unintuitive.  Finally, Honda somehow made sense of it all and came up with a good solution; a fair amount of buttons, but not too many.  Their best example of this is in their 2018 Accord.  However when tesla does the same, but worse, people respond with statements like, ""that's SOOOOO cool!"", and ""what a smart and clean design.""  In conclusion, like whatever you want to like.  If you think batteries, 5.5 sec. 0-60, and having to look at a screne and go through menus to turn on the windshield wipers makes a car an absolute must have, then I think you have found your car.  Just be aware of your own biases, (of which we all have),  when promoting your favorite car company, and don't be suprised when not every person bows down to a certin car or car company's philosophy.",0.9807,278
tribalypredisposed I am german and I am very dissapointed with the herman car companies... Tesla just is a better car. Just that it is electric makes it better.,0.7003,31
tribalypredisposed You have to know that the battery pack temperatjre is not the problem. The electric motor is overheating not the batteries! Because the Tesla even has to heat up the batteries to 50 degrees to get max power. And that is what they improved in the new Roadster. The motor will not overheat anymore.,0.6858,60
