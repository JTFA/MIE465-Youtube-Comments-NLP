"""Still, I don't think it's a game that hates traditional game design thought. It doesn't loathe winning or even really fetishize pain the way that maso-core platformers or kaizo games do.""

On the contrary, I do get a strong feeling that Bennett Foddy loathes the way mainstream design treats games like a ""complete vacation package"" -- using competitive score tables, achievements, and tutorials as guides so players are led toward experiencing ""everything"" in the game. During my play through I even talked about the ""easter egg"" which appears at the end of GOIWBF to illustrate this. Sure, his hatred isn't specifically about either ""win state"" or ""loss state"", but about who is defining what it means to win/lose and how that impacts the way people approach games.

"""Video games have always had accessibility features: we just documented them poorly and called them “cheat codes”."" I'd say they were dev tools. Godmode, noclip, change map, etc may function as accessibility features, but that's doesn't mean they were created as such. That's not an argument against accessibility features, I just find 'we've had cheats, therefore we must have accessibility features' a strange line of reasoning.

""Accessibility features in video games are entirely transparent to those who choose not to use them."" For strictly single-player games, sure. Lots of games aren't that though. Providing an alternate colorscheme for colorblind people won't matter, but providing extra hp/damage/etc as an 'accessibility feature' will.

Demanding easier modes in games under the accessibility flag seems strange to me. A game is a designed experience, and to say that 'the same experience should be provided through easier means' seems to say that 'difficulty' is something that exists independently of the experience.

Yes, exactly... you said *quality* and depth. *You also said meat*, which implies a subjective value proposition.
That quality can apply to many things, if you're not precise with what you're talking about; experience quality VS graphical quality, for instance.
I took this to mean ""experience quality,"" because titles in this range, *$8*, aren't usually technical marvels.
This game has good, fair controls and mechanics. The challenge comes from your own inability. It has excellent ""quality."" It is well made , and delivers its experience well.
There is plenty of ""meat,"" to put it in your vague wording, it just depends what meat you're in the mood for.

It's not a puzzle game, it's a _skill_ game. Like climbing in real life, sure, there is a bit of musing over the ideal route, but that ""puzzle"" quickly solved. The real challenge comes from whether you can actually pull it off. The narration is largely irrelevant. It is *far* more _unique_ than a game like _Braid_ .

As far as ""depth"" goes, sure, it's not a _complicated_ game, but neither is Braid. And that's fine, their not _meant_ to be, it just depends on what you're looking for.",0.9641,254

While I can accept failure in competitive multiplayer (I can't ask for people to be easy on me because I'm not as quick), It's really hard to accept failure in solo experiences where bosses demand you to react super fast (I'm looking at you Hyperlight Drifter and your sudden wall of difficulty at the first boss).

This is a game that does not care if you play it or not. Maybe some beat it out of spite for that. How dare the game show indifference to the player. But for others, that should be all the more reason to quit. In the commitment to keep climbing, that is a challenge to oneself. You are challenging your skill and most importantly your patience.

"As a person who is a challenge junkie in games, I'm really glad you shared your perspective.

I really don't mean to be prescribing my own interpretation of your experience to you, these are just my own personal ideas and reflections on what you've said and I'm cognizant of that. But it sounds to me like the frustration you feel comes from a different source that causes it to simply be a negative experience, rather than a motivating one. Those issues with nausea, anxiety, depth perception problems and the like I would imagine have a lot of grief built up behind them, and it's possible you've also had to wrestle with the shameful feelings of ""Am I experiencing this pain simply because I'm not good enough as a person?"".

Indeed, it likely only exacerbates those thoughts you're trying to challenge and overcome when you face memories of that elitism that does exist in gaming culture, as the elitism likely states that you ""deserve"" the grief and that you just have to ""git gud"" or go home. Those thoughts are toxic, and understandably would not lead to a motivating experience.

Let me just restate, before I go on, that yes I know that is a massive over-reading into your personal psychology from a single comment on a Youtube video xD (a crime against The Beginner's Guide). But I do think there's the potential for that construct of emotion to exist in somebody, so maybe treat this as a more general reflection on this nature of finding games purely about challenge distasteful.

My own psychological journey has had me wrestling, through my entire life, that I've always been capable enough to do anything I wanted, if I simply had the motivation and self-control to see it through. Games of pure failure and defeat (like Getting Over It, or Dark Souls) I find so directly challenge me in that regard, the very barrier to overcoming those games (for me) is whether I can continue to motivate myself to see them through to the end. I do sometimes get frustrated playing those games, but that anger to me is fuel to *resolve* a psychological issue I have in my life, that if I make it further in those games that I am proving to myself that I can motivate myself and actually achieve something!

And I think it's really important to restate that I play these games because of that unique interaction with my personal experience and story in life, the ghosts that still haunt me and how these games help me resolve them. And indeed, however poorly I may have guessed at your personal story (and I'm sorry if my attempt came off as offensively bad!), the fundamental point that your story demands a different experience from art is something to be deeply aware of. Maybe those amazing games like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley help you to feel like you can experience great beauty and joy in life without having to experience more personal hell with those personal challenges you face. I don't know. But I hope what I said at least gave you some personal insight into one story, one reason, as to why some people like these games.

They've already warmed their gloves with the funny tech demos they've been selling. It's something to look forward to. Even though I can't even afford a Cockulus Rift. Or decent internet. Or a repairman. 

Or maybe Left 4 Dead 3. That'd be fine, too. That's pretty much the most leaked secret project they've been working on recently.

""Games"" have been used for a catch all term for all digital interactive entertainment, even though that's kind of inaccurate. That's likely because they've always been mixed together from the start because these mediums share the exact same technology.

I definitely don't have the skill or patience to do so. 

You're also discounting the ""positive"" thing that came from the game is the many people who played and enjoyed it. I never made it passed ""Orange Hell"" (but did finish Dark Souls I-III), but I really enjoyed the game. And that's not because of any ""memes"". I got the game through Humble Monthly before it was even a big thing. Somehow, I still really enjoyed it. And I don't see how it's so terrible to watch other's enjoy it.

"Difficulty Versus Accessibility? No way in hell to avoid talking about Celeste, there.

What fascinates me about Celeste is that it seems to contextualize it's difficulty in a completely different way from, say Kaizo games or Getting Over It - the game is hard as hell, but it wants you to succeed. It wants players to eventually beat it, with enough perseverance and time. This is what the game is about, too - Madeline wants to climb the mountain because she want to prove she can do something difficult. Compared to other hard platformers, Celeste is practically cheering for you.

Which brings me to the assist mode. It's a great idea: if you want to, you can break the game and make it easier, to play through the story and art content without as much difficulty.

It wasn't to convey irony but to oppose it to the quote from the game ""most obstacles in video games are fake"". I didn't mean only the best players are supposed to play those game, but only the ones who accept that mindset. The challenge is ""real"" because you will obviously fail but also maybe you won't make it, whereas most game will balance their challenge to make you fail a few time but you'll get past it eventually, not necessarily because you got better at the game but because you understood how to get past a specific obstacle.

"Every paragraph responds to every one of yours:

I't pretentious because of all the ""challange is more like an grapefruit than like an orange"" bs. Sure, it calls itself trash, but (as far as I can tell) it thinks that making itself trash is a profound artistic statment too (it's not btw). Minimalistic art is when you presnet something simple that fits in surprisingly well within the context - despite being simple it's inclusion into the space makes it accentuate something aesthetically. This is not it. I can't remember the name of the game, but a few years ago there was this, all black and white, platformer where you played a kid going through a forest (among other locations I believe) and facing environmental hasards that made your child character die - that one had a minimalistic art style. This is: I have a V-A-G-U-E point to make about difficulty in games so I'm gonna take chepo assets from online stores, scramble something conveniantly simple to make with 'em that illustrates my point and voila. It's not art, it's a simple visualisation of a point - it's a pie chart.

The commentary can be however the fuck long one wants it to make. What I'm saying is that all that there is to say about the game can be said in 5 min tops. The rest isn't dead air, it's just semantically barren.

You are crazy. What sort of emotionally retarded sea cucumber would feel thretened by a game review online? Or is this the point? Are you just making a veield ""ad hominem""?

"Fachewa Chewa Fachewa Chewa ok I will totally admit that the quote probably does not encapsulate his complete view, it was simply what I got out of that quote. It is by nature of being viewed second hand in a video, our of context. It did not sound like he was just saying ""frustration is not inherently bad"" but also ""without frustration and unwieldiness games and their players are not worthy"" but I will admit that is my reading, and I don't know enough about him to back that up. 

""Games as escapism"" and elitism however, I will argue, can and do go together. Yes, games are power fantasies and for many that fantasy is beating games that are considered hard enough. It is still escapism, but it is being the very best within that escapist hobby. It is about the subculture of gaming and not the content of the games themselves. Does that make sense? Idk.  I will concede however that it may just be a vocal minority, but it is the experience I've had with online gaming culture. 

I have to admit sorry I do not understand your air quotes over ""real"". If they are not meant to convey irony which is what I suspect, then that is the very elitism that I was talking of. It is the notion that only the best are meant for that style of play that I found distasteful, not its existence. I too believe that we should have the options of both challenge, relaxation and everything in-between. It did sound like he (the developer not errant signal sorry) was deriding games that were not up to his standard of punishment.

Or even a game like I Wanna Be The Guy, which is just infinitely cruel to the player as an inside joke.

"Great game, just got ruined for me because of the weird dissonance I felt at the beginning and couldn’t shake the more I played. The sense of accomplishment of making it to a new area or dissecting a particular enemy pattern felt hollow (badum-tish) because I had no reason to go there other than “BUT I WANNA GO THERE, PWEASE DADDY GAME DEVEWOPERS PWEASE HELP ME GIT GUD SO I CAN GO THERE”. I didn’t want the game to hold my hand; I just wanted the game to help me understand WHY I SHOULD DO WHAT THE GAME ALLOWS ME TO DO. Should I explore every nook and cranny, slaughter every enemy multiple times, research builds, plumb the game’s lore and argue “what it all means” on Reddit because HURR DURR I’M A GAMURR AND BEING A GAMIRR MEANS I BETTER DO ALL THAT STUFF BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT I AM!!!!!11!!111!! 

No. That’s NOT the reason why players do all that stuff. They don’t do those things because “welp they’re gamers and that’s just what gamers do”. They do it because they enjoy the game. Their mind has hooked into this work of art and now they derive enjoyment out of exploring what said work of art means to them. Each person does explore art differently; my older brother (who’s now my sister, long story) loved Dark Souls because she enjoyed the mechanical gameplay challenge the game presented. Me? I saw the level of detail in those mechanics, marveled at the level design, loved the medieval theming, and still got a sour experience because the player-character starts as a murderous jerk for no apparent reason at the end of the world.

A lot of games can be great drama to watch someone try and fail and then win at, but most require some level of explanation, ""what's this do? What does this mean? what just happened?"" The most popular streaming games, mobas like LOL and DOTA most definitely do, but Getting Over It is in its design to visually transparent; when you fall, you fall, when you climb, you climb etc., it has to me been one of the most enjoyable games to watch live streamed.",0.9902,180

There are things that are challenging for challenge's sake, like trying to win a chess match against a really good program. It's actually a feat that not many people can do.

Hi Joe!,0.0,3
"Hm. I disagree. Not with your reading of the game, it's quite plain that you are articulating the creator's intent but rather with the philosophy presented. Someone else has already pointed out the connotations of this philosophy concerning restricting game accessibility and the fetishizing of challenge, and that certainly came to mind when watching this video. The creator's comments about games ""without frustration"" annoyed me, and I just now have figured out why. For one, like the notion of ""fun""; challenge and frustration is subjective, and although like this one, there are games designed to frustrate, a perfectly soothing game might frustrate you. It might even frustrate you because you don't find it challenging. 

For example, I as a person prone to nausea and with depth perception problems find first person shooters extremely frustrating on a very basic level. It does not make it an engaging experience for me. When I get frustrated, often I just stop playing the game. Gaming is my escapism from my frustrating and anxiety-filled life, I don't play games to be frustrated and I don't need frustration to find an experience engaging. However, I accept that people do play games to beat a challenge, to endure frustration. It is a problem I find with analyses of games that so often they limit the potential of games by focusing on specific outcomes and intents. 

Secondly, I think in certain contexts when a player feels frustrated it is because a game designer has done their job poorly, and sometimes it is because they have done their job extremely well. And again, this depends on a personal threshold of what they consider frustration. I can think of many amazing games I never really felt truly frustrated at, like animal crossing, or stardew valley. I enjoy games that have a certain level of difficulty when I enjoy them and that's not all the time. Games don't have to offer one experience - and calling back to the ""that's no game"" episode I like to think that games don't have to be just one thing, and that games that do something different (like being frustrating or being calming) don't have to oppose one another. 

On a certain level I understand his point but my first thought is concerning the elitism within gaming culture that breeds toxicity - the amount of discussion around Dark Souls's difficulty that was not about what the game does well to make it challenging but how people are ""pussies"" for not rising to the challenge comes to mind.

The concept of enjoying challenge and taking it further to enjoying failure is an interesting one, but one I personally cannot connect to. Maybe I'm an idiot who's a total casul and can't appreciate challenge but I like to think that maybe it's just a facet of what games can offer that I don't connect to. And that's kind of okay. I guess. 

I dunno.",0.9275,541

"I am one of those people for whom frustration is flat out unhealthy, like legit migraine-inducing, anger-raging frustration that destroys anything positive about whatever activity I am doing. Sure, part of the reason why I’m that way is because I am also the kind of person that completely immerses myself in a particular activity, meaning I slip into whatever intended emotional state the developers may have intended for their game easier than most people, so I end up in an amplified state that is not normal. 

If the developers intended a fairy-tale like sense of wonderment, I feel every second of that despite the frustration at times (Ori and the Blind Forest); constant vigilance and requiring of absolute mastery of game mechanics to make significant progress in the first main level outside the tutorial where the payoff from the time investment is 30 hours to FINALLY get to a point where I can FINALLY fight THE FIRST REAL BOSS (Dark Souls 1) leaves me so drained and defeated that the minor satisfaction of FINALLY GETTING X DISTANCE is completely undermined by the struggle to get there (also most MMOs deliver the same result because of the content treadmill); multiplayer PvP shooters and MOBAs are constant self-struggles to stay calm and not get invested because the moment I do get invested I inevitably crash and burn via disappointment in either my performance or the performance of my teammates in a remarkably unhealthy way which kills the game’s enjoyment for me (Overwatch and League of Legends).",-0.9612,275

I don't shy away from challenging or even frustrating games, but that challenge or frustration without any context except the abstract challenge of getting over that frustration itself sounds awful.

"I can understand what Foddy is getting at, but... I actually don't think this is why I play games at all. I'm usually much more interested in narrative, or in games that serve as brain teasers.

As far as conquering something difficult... I think that's more satisfying to me if it's out there in reality--learning a new skill, doing something you've never done before, visiting a new place... those types of things are exciting and fun. Getting Over It doesn't appeal to me, I suppose, because there's nothing for me in return for the frustration.

"I can vouch that buying 3 indie B games instead of a $60 monster title have literally been a joy.  

On a steam sale, I went ahead and got three games for about $25.
-Hyper Light Drifter
-Seasons After Fall
and
-TRI: Of Friendship and Madness

only hyperlight drifter had an overall close to perfect experience (at least for getting close to 2D AAA quality), but it had it's problems.

Seasons after Fall was a wonderously beautiful game, but it was extremely apparent that ALL of the budget went into looks, and the gameplay and controls were a hollow husk.


Of all of them, I ABSOLUTELY enjoyed TRI: Of Friendship and Madness. Again, not perfect, but it was a B grade game. It's 3D looked like it was from the 2000s. Level completions reminded me of DOS style games with simple OK screens to move on. This game though, made a whole mechanic over a literal detatched polygon (it technically has thickness), but it was so intuative. And their low budget managed to STILL crack out a satisfying story with a superbly crafted world that was totally consistent in art direction.

Sure, people can literally beat the game in ~2 minutes... but it's not about that. For me, this is a game that is actually soothing, and even meditative. It's not about reaching the top, it's about making something out of it for yourself. Subsequently, the game is extremely replayable, and a lot of people have put in more time with this game than other similarly priced titles.

If we live in a world where we have to celebrate artist actually being artist rating then money making machine or for policemen to do their job instead of eating donuts all day or the waiter to be on time with the plate without breaking anything then what a sad world we are in.

Maybe it's just me or maybe I am stupid but I do not understand the appeal and before you ask yes I tried and it wasn't that hard since I planned how I would go about every obstacle and actually took my time. And once I got about with the orange I stopped not because I was defeated but because the experience was not teaching me anything.

"I feel like there's something missing from this topic of frustration in games: the Phyrric Victory.

The discussion of challenge in games, especially extreme challenge and punishment, is often based on an assumed fact: the more challenging it is, the more satisfying it necessarily is to complete. But how often is that actually, you know, true?

How many times have you been so ""done"" with something that you don't even feel good when you've finally completed it? That you just feel regret for not quitting while you were ahead. That your ""reward"" for finishing it was the realization that you didn't need to do it and that you could have done something else that you liked more?

I think that's a concept that gets overlooked on this topic and to some extent is a foil Foddy's concern over disposable satisfaction. At least in games that spoon-feed you success, you still get SOMETHING out of it, if only a hollow dopamine rush. But a phyrric victory just makes you feel worse after finally succeeding than you did while failing. 

Which is sort of why I think it's important and acceptable for players to renegotiate the terms at which they interact with games; at least single player ones. Difficulty selections, Super Guides, cheats, mods, and straight up hacks. I argue someone modding their copy of Getting Over It to have low gravity is ultimately just as valid as them playing the way foddy wanted them to, since it's ultimately a response to his statement.",0.7202,283

Is there even any reason to assume more challenging games are more ""real"" than others? What does that even mean?",-0.1079,80
"I get where Foddy is coming from, but I can't say I agree with him. Saying that a game is ""mere software"" and thus a bad game if it doesn't frustrate or punish the player is mind-boggling to me.
I also think you're conflating Foddy's views on frustration with anything concerning challenge or difficulty. Because from what I've seen, he doesn't talk about what can be _considered_ a challenge, only what he _wants_ from it. Maybe he says more about challenge in Getting Over It? I dunno.

There are many games which are generally considered pretty damn difficult, like N++ or Super Meat Boy, but which are designed to not be frustrating. You have infinite retries and lose very little time if you do die, but that doesn't make them any easier. Does that make them bad or ""mere software""?
I and many others don't think so, as both games are quite well regarded. I find it highly doubtful that all those people are wrong and Foddy is the one person who knows what makes a Good Game.

More than that even, it would also apply to the vast majority of puzzle games. Yes, he mentioned Myst which isn't punishing, but, according to him, is frustrating. But that's a very different flavor of frustration than in Getting Over It. When you fail in Myst, you're not punted back to the beginning of the game.
And really, the best puzzle games I've played were freaking difficult, but never frustrating. I could spend hours on a single puzzle, fail again and again, but never be frustrated. In fact, the times where they did frustrate me were when they felt the weakest. Does that make them worse than Myst? Does that make them ""mere software""?

Furthermore, what you said is even more all-encompassing than Foddy's generalizations.
""If you were given an infinite number of chances to make this next little section perfectly right, is that really a challenge?""
This would include even stuff like Myst which Foddy hails in his article on frustration. Whatever Foddy's views on challenge are, I don't think they include how many retries you have.

"I know you aren't as attuned to mechanical design as other aspects of game design, so I wanted to give you my perspective on the topic of difficulty and consistency.

First, a little bit of context: I believe that the act of progressing is what compels me the most in games.  I tend to focus solely on forward motion through the story/world, and I tend to seek full completion when doing so is important in the context of the game's mechanics (for example, every achievement in the Binding of Isaac unlocks items for future runs, that's why I spent the time and effort on getting every single one).  I also believe that I am currently suffering the effects of maladaptive perfectionism, combined with my mind being unhealthily devastated when expectations are suddenly pulled out from under me.

You'd think that I'd avoid tough challenges like the plague from what I've said.  And to some extent, you'd be right.  But that compulsion to make progress and mechanically wring a game of its potential has occasionally led to what feels like unnecessary pain.
When I say pain, I'm not talking about some twinge of frustration that comes and goes.  I'm talking about something that I realize must be wrong, something that exists in the game that I'm unable to change or avoid.  Let me try to explain an example of this:

Keeper in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.  This character starts out with awful damage per second, the slowest movement speed, and 2 coins as health (with no ability to upgrade your health, unlike almost every other character.  In a game focused on avoiding enemy bullets and enemies that chase after you to cause contact damage, this results in runs where you aren't provided with movement speed or damage upgrades.  And there are rooms with enemies placed in a way that you require massive dps or flight in order to avoid damage (there's one room I have in mind right now, that throws you into a combat scenario with several charging spiders that surround you in literally less than 2 seconds).  Not every run is winnable, even at TAS level.
Moments like this are nothing short of heart-wrenching to me, and I feel helpless to change anything in the future, as from my perspective, every random run has the same probability to be a success or a failure as the last one.  After a 10 losing streak, I'm unconsciously convinced that my agency has vanished.  I wish I could tell the developers about this, at least that could give me a little hope...

And I know some people can be fine with that.  But I want to say that this type of design has no place in a strict mechanically-focused game.  Let me try and address possible counter-arguments:

First off, the idea that games where everything can be predicted and controlled by the player are artificial by nature, and that occasional unexpected disaster makes the game feel more real.
Of course it is, that's the fundamental idea behind mechanically focused games.  To give you an unnatural yet reliable and enjoyable experience.
With games that attempt to immerse you in a realistic setting, that argument can hold some water.  For example, Dark Souls encouraged players to poke around and see which paths were dangerous to find the correct path early on.
But with a game where everything is blatantly digital and artificial to begin with (the majority of roguelites), that argument can only act as a cop-out, unless the entire game is designed around that aforementioned idea (Getting Over It seems to fit here).

Second, some people say that it's interesting and memorable when something disastrous suddenly happens.
I can buy that, but only as opinion.  Never as truth.
I'm not talking about scripted unconveyed moments here (like monsters in set positions dropping from the ceiling).  I'm talking about when random elements cause the course of a run to immediately plummet toward failure, for example when you get a shield hacking event in Sector 1 of FTL, and the enemy ship's drone destroys you or cripples you immensely.
I don't think moments like these should ever be defended in games with a pure mechanical focus.  They need to be addressed directly, and not dismissed by anyone.

(I want to quickly mention that I feel sick to my stomach when someone implies that being able to win at something consistently makes it too easy by default, that's just not true.  And even if it can be true, it's still something that messes with me mentally.)

Finally, some people attempt to deflect the issue by claiming that I'm just not meant to do what I'm doing.  An example is of the Four Kings in NG+6 in Dark Souls 1.  I vented once about how the encounter is an incredibly strict DPS battle requiring minmaxing, despite the fact that Dark Souls 1 encourages slow and safe tactics the entire time (with a couple blatantly unfinished exceptions, such as the Capra Demon and Bed of Chaos).  Someone responded by saying that maybe I'm just not supposed to expect that kind of fairness from New Game Plus 6, that maybe it isn't supposed to be a fair encounter at that point.  But the developers set the variables for enemy damage and health, and the game doesn't just get harder infinitely, it stops at New Game plus 6.  I guess that this isn't much of a complaint, considering that that person was sort of half right, but the fact that the Four Kings forces you to completely change how you fight a boss in a way that takes you out of the experience and focus on numbers over in-the-moment decisions just screams bad design to me.


And none of this even scratches the surface of a more contentious topic, the limits of human reaction.  This is where things start changing from purifying the mechanical focus of a game to creating accessibility, which is something that people tend to think negatively of when it comes to games with a heavy mechanical focus.
By limits of human reaction, I'm referring to reading telegraphs in a split second (e.g. Dark Souls 3 and Devil May Cry), processing perceivable consequences within an incredibly short amount of time (enemies in Crypt of the Necrodancer, for instance, can have seemingly unpredictable effects yet work within very consistent mechanics, therefore all multi-tiered interactions can be perceived and dealt with properly, even in a split second), handling incredibly sensitive movement (like how the hammer in Getting Over It is technically consistent, but the fact that you're limited by your human motion means that consistent will never yield consistent movement, the real world causes too much variance for the average human), and last but not least, perfect steadiness (the ability to make no mistakes for extended periods of time.  Out of all the topics listed thus far, this one has been triggering my perfectionism the most because I simultaneously understand what needs to be done, while also feeling like no progress is ever made at improving myself other than sheer luck.  ""Maybe during the past 75 runs, my brain never got distracted once at key moments that my runs pivoted on.  But now I can never replicate that or improve on it until it lines up in the same way.""  These types of thoughts eat away at me.  No joke.).  This topic can vary from person to person, for example, not everyone has the same minimum reaction time, therefore there isn't an axiomatic standard for perceivable telegraphs.
I don't have any definitive statements on this topic, but I believe that all developers who wish to push their players to such a high level of mechanical finesse should be required to be aware of such variance in human limits.


This topic has been on my mind for quite a while now, and it's something I've had trouble fully explaining to any single person.  Hopefully I was able to compile everything in a way that made sense.  Thank you so much for reading this.",-0.9761,1497
"I like his philosophy, but I don't agree with what he credits as the source of the difficulty.  From his quote from the blog at 12:15, it seems like he attributes games that are ""obedient"" are too easy, hand-holding, and can't be challenging.  Games can certainly be difficult but control perfectly, such as Super Meat Boy, which is shown constantly in this video.  It's also why people like Super Mario Bros. and Dark Souls.  They are ""obedient"" because they are consistent and follow the rules.  In fact, this is the difference between a fair and unfair game.  (I haven't played Getting Over It, and so I'm not accusing it of being either.)

To be fair, based off the video and the blog, I do suspect that his usage of the word ""obedient"" does not mean ""controls tightly or well,"" but rather ""reacts as perfectly desired"" or ""does not present obstacles"" ... in which case, I would not use the word ""obedient,"" but that's neither here nor there lol.",0.9873,206

There's difference between difficulty for appeal (see later souls games) and difficulty for difficulty's sake, even.

"I rarely feel satisfaction if I got through a poorly designed (in my opinion) part of a game that requires luck and trying again and again to get past it. The frustation often comes from feeling it's wasting my time by making me figure out a very specific set of moves just to get through it - a padding of game time. The lack of satisfaction comes from my time still being wasted after I've gone through it - just to continue with another wise fun game.

Like I really enjoyed watching people play Alien: Isolation, however because of the frustrating and broken saving system I haven't finished it, because I got annoyed with having to play a certain sequence for yet fifth time because it never saved (even if I saved in between) and I couldn't be arsed to play through that same junction again that I wasted roughtly 45 minutes on just to get wasted at the end. That's poor design in my opinion. I feel the fear should come from the alien getting you - not ""OMG did this crappy game save properly or is there a save around so I don't have to replay the same shit over and over again?"" 

I am not adverse to challenge. I recently finished ME2 on Hardcore and once I beat ME3 and start all over I will go to the next hardest one (even though I really despise not being able to save all the time as well - but at least you can often just get away from the fights and save then.) The difficulty there is entirely of your choosing, you can play on easy and enjoy the story for what it is - not have things blocked from you because you aren't ready to face insanity.

"I think it's not really the point. In 11 flavors of frustration, Foddy talks about what kind of frustration he likes, basically saying ""frustration isn't inherently bad"". Of course sometimes a game can be frustrating in the wrong way.

In Getting Over It, he talks about how difficult games aren't really challenging ""most obstacles in video games are fake"" (as Jon Blow said about the challenge in the witness, it wouldn't be a challenge if you were sure you could do it) and that frustration is part of the challenge. It's also about taking your time ""everything's fresh for about 6 seconds"" / ""in this context it's tempting to make friendly content"" (you can check out the full speed here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6ouSMm7Uc).

I think the elitist side come from the quote from his blog post used in this video. But it's not meant to be understood as ""only hard and frustrating games are good"". Remember that Foddy is a teacher a NYU (he recently said this https://www.kpopp.io/games/ten-mississippi.html was prototyped in his class), and that Cibele and The Beginner's Guide inspired Getting Over It too.

In fact, I'm pretty sure that ""game as escapism"" is the more popular view, even if the elitist gamer is more vocal. Getting Over It and 11 flavors of frustrations are made for ""a certain kind of person"". It's not about imposing a way of playing, it's about giving another option. A ""real"" challenge, for people who are ready to try without knowing if they'll be able to ""win"". And at that point the frustration isn't bad, it's unavoidable.",-0.5688,309
"I think part of it may be due to the fact that, ""it's just games"". It's ultimately a pointless activity, as in there is no tangible reward or benefit to others. Even if we got better at the game, if the game itself is considered pointless, what's the point of getting better? It is up to the player to give the challenge some meaning.

I think we can sometimes be caught in the need to overcome the challenge. It could be from pride, it could be from social anxiety from being judged. If this is the case, we are really just avoiding punishment, and the sense of victory would be too little to balance the hardship and frustration.

However I do believe that honoring the challenge is a must for the sense of victory. It's like yin-yang, one cannot exist without the other.

That being said, one should not feel obliged to overcome a challenge. Games are ""just games"", and you can't beat every game on the planet. Plus, games can be enjoyed in many ways, overcoming the challenge is but one of them. At no point should it be regarded as the only way to enjoy a game.",0.819,228

But we really like to pull things apart and sadly most of the conversation is binary in how things are good or things are bad, and boy, how people love to focus on the bad. 

In regards to this game, it reminded me about a gaming dilemma I've been wondering. How can we define bad controls? Is getting better with a weird control pointless? Does an ideal control is the right way to play? And if something is so unreliable and painful to use as a controller, how bad is it if you can still beat the game?",0.726,141
"I understand what you're saying about Phyrric victories, but I think it's less related to challenge, and more related to our need to feel like what we did, mattered. Rewarding experiences often come from our feelings of accomplishment and growth. You started out really bad at a game, and slowly got better until you mastered it. That means something.

Flipping coins isn't satisfying, even when you win. Finishing a marathon can be satisfying, even if it takes you twice as long as everyone else. It's not just about the difficulty, it's also about our ability to control our destiny. If a game is too easy, we often feel as though we were NOT in control - the outcome was decided before we sat down to play. The same goes with games that are so hard that they're beyond our comprehension, as well as the experiences that seem random or arbitrary - we don't feel like our actions really mattered.",0.9603,177

Why is the man in a cauldron? Why is he referred to as ""Diogenes"", even though Diogenes lived in a giant amphora and not a pot? What is the significance of the ceaseless running commentary and literary quotes? All of these things seem to me like feeble attempts at making a meaningless challenge meaningful by a designer who has arbitrarily ruled out the best means of doing that: telling an actual story.

As irritating as I find this game's mechanics, and as unfair as I think its design is, I wouldn't carp so much about it if the game had remained silent and just left you to it. Lots of arcade games present a challenge with very little context, and you're expected to get your enjoyment out of the challenge alone, but those games don't pretentiously talk your ear off while you play about a ""deeper meaning"" that isn't there.

What I see in this game is the typical postmodern put-on that uncreative authors often resort to: be as vague as possible, make arcane literary allusions that most players won't be familiar with (so they won't be able to call out how irrelevant those allusions are), frame your lack of story as being a profound commentary on the very nature of storytelling itself, and just generally suggest substance where you haven't bothered to actually create any.

"I'm going to adress the points you make in the order you make them in.

If you co-op the PvE in Dark Souls you're a filthy casual and should honestly kill yourself. Seriously though: my point is more that DS makes a more poignant point about what and how (perhaps not why) a challange is something satisfying to accomplish. The themes in the game do everything they can to reinforce the feeling of hopelesness of the task all along thus further emphesizing the point that ultimatley what matters is the acomplishing of the challange - the act itself - whereas the positive effects (you made Lordran's age of fire last a tad longer) are ultimatley inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. And that's the point: it doesn't matter that what you do W I L L fail, what matters is that, for now, it doesn't. It's a game that, by being hopless on every damn step of the way, manages to tell you never to despair.

I'm not particularily interested in discussing weather or not the game gave people entertainment or not. I mean, I'm not averse to the idea of discussing that, just that I'm not interested in it now - I'm interested in discussing it's value as an art piece.

My objection isn't that he's discussing it, s'more that he takes 20 min to discuss something that deserves five at most. And that's not because it's an indy title, it's because it lacks in content - not assets, or levels, or play time - in content as in reasonably interesting things it has to say that something else (that happens to be much better known) says better anyway.

Now to add a point of my own atop all that:
My frustration with games like that (any type of art really) is that they are made for the insiders only. QWOP isn't an interesting game, it's making a reasonably interesting point. Well, s'more that it points out an interesting (potential) thing in game design or even interface design in general. But as far as a game, well, you play it for 5 min, and than you either deside it's some gay ass-shit or, if you're into game design, you get the point. And than the experiance is over. It might aswell been a one point long powerpoint presentation with QWOP as a visual aid. Art is shit if it doesn't ""speak"" to people and this doesn't even make the attempt. It's not art, it's a point they designer wanted to make.

Side note: (and it is important to mention that I haven't read the book Campster mentions) but this idea of there being a paradox in enjoying something that is painful sounds like remarkably retarded shit. Pease learn the difference between plasure and satisfaction. They are decidedly different psychological phenomena.",0.7437,530
"I'm not sure how astounded you can be. QWOP was frustrating, had no real victory, and had sufficiently little skill to it that it felt like a funny but stupid game. A game defines itself by how it acts, the mindset it puts you in. How you approach a game is perhaps more important than mechanics and plot combined, because it is the context within which the entire game operates. As such the most major difference between QWOP and Getting Over It is that QWOP feels like it's just being silly in a frustrating, funny way. By contrast Getting Over It seems to present itself as a challenge, a pile of 'empty shells' as you put it.

Besides, the shell isn't empty. The fruit in the middle is getting to the top. The core concept, difficulty making victory sweeter, remains the same. It just amped up the difficulty, and made it so you have to keep digging for hours to get the fruit.

Calling Getting Over It low-grade entertainment does the game a disservice. The game's beauty lies in the challenge it presents, the attitude of the narrator, the idea it represents. You may disagree with the design philosophy it espouses, but that doesn't mean there is no message.",-0.7939,237

"It seems to me this game combines two kinds of challenge. One of them I don't consider challenge at all - but rather designed malice. Basically, the fact that the game itself is difficult, that you need to be precise to do certain parts of it is challenge. Here it seems like parts of it are designed, demanding that you do them in a particular way; while other parts are just random and you can cheese your way through them if you bend the physics - which I guess is also a kind of design.

But the fact that you lose your entire progress? That's not difficulty. There's nothing ""difficult"" or ""challenging"" about deciding to do the whole thing over again. It's frustrating, annoying, malicious... but if a game's challenge is down to ""how much time am I willing to spend with this to complete it"" then it's not really a systemically designed difficulty, is it?

There are games that combine the two and come out on top: Hotline Miami, for example. Super Meat Boy perhaps, though for me it veers too much into the ""malicious design"" camp.

"It took looking up the story later for me to realize what the world was all about and why the player-character was doing all the things they do in the first place; the tiniest of changes could have brought me on-board with the game for a FAR longer period of time than just to the gargoyles. I just didn’t want to be a murderous jerk SPECIFICALLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON. At first. Like I said, there are subtle ways to prod players down a particular narrative context without ruining the unique storytelling and gameplay opportunities the series provides, and Bloodborne does this well by throwing the player into a Lovecraftian nightmare of a world that gets more corrupted and messed up the farther they progress. Don’t you want to see the game’s nightmarishly crazy ride through to the end?! BAM, instant narrative motivation that doesn’t sacrifice the game’s unique gameplay and storytelling flow. 

I had a similar hang-up with Borderlands 2. The twist near the end of the game is that Angel (I forget her name, the siren who guides you through most of the game) kills herself to give a massive “f*** you” to her Dad, the main bad guy Handsome Jack, at this incredible climactic moment. It’s a huge moment, one that has incredible thematic weight to the game. 

And then Jack kidnaps the other Siren from the previous game (Lilith? The fire-siren), puts her in the same prison Angel was in forcing her into Angel’s old role, and nearly gets the player-character killed by somehow teleporting them all the way back to the main town hub. 

80 hours of work. Of world building. Of approaching Angel’s heroic-ish sacrifice (turns out her dad was using her powers against her will to power up an ancient weapon capable of “pacifying” Pandora, the main planet the game takes place on, so her getting herself killed is actually heroic in a twisted sense despite it being technically suicide). Of coming so damn close to paying off that narrative tension in the kind of climax emblematic of the psychologically twisted comedy-camp set in a Mad Max-inspired apocalyptic theming the game does so well. 

ALL. F***ING. WASTED. 

All for nothing, as Handsome Jack just instantly picks up where he left off and keeps on being who he is. 

No payoff. No closure. No goddamn justice for a character who worked so damn hard to do the only thing she could do: die, so that others would have a chance to be free.

Tl;dr: Because I’m sensitive to games that don’t synergize frustration with context provided either by narrative, meta, or implied, I can see Bennett Foddy’s point, and simultaneously point out the massive irony in “Getting Over It”: He crafted a game where the meta-context behind the gameplay and its mechanics is the very discussion about the role frustration plays in game design as a whole. I can see how personal the topic is for the guy, but there are reasons why game developers put so much effort into the story of a game, or the context behind the game or the context behind why a game is the way it is, even when that context is “lol that’s just what gamers do herpaderp” (Ittle Dew 2).

I found I never really related to this idea that there aren't incremental victories in Getting Over It.

Every huge setback was another chance for me to further hone my skill at a previous area, and if I did progress forward, I saw it as a way of the game challenging me to develop my skill in a new area.

I suppose this tendency is a double-edged sword. I've never been one much to progress for the sake of progressing, I always feel as though I need to learn and grow.

The shooting mechanics, loot progression, meta-humor, in-your-face cyber-steam-punk-meets-Mad-Max aesthetic polishes over the tragedy that runs so deep in that series; there were times when I’d come across some dark and messed-up ending for some sympathetic character and simply gloss it over because it’s fun to shoot the loot piñata enemies. This caused Angel’s tragedy to smash my heart at full speed out of left field.

"Max Backemark-Thunberg So the best games would require you, to learn (but help you along) all the vast amounts of ways to deal with a particular emotional/psychological/philosophical problem, and then ask you to balance them out and learn which tool is the best tool for a given situation?

That sounds amazing.

"Maybe I just don't take games as seriously as Chris (ok I certainly don't), but failure in life is nothing like ""failure"" in a game, where the only real consequence is a small time loss and whatever emotion you want to attach to that. Isn't a lack of real consequences the whole appeal of a game anyway?
It's incredible you can create a 20 minute video exploring philosophy from a game like Get Over It, tho the basis feels unrealistic and the conclusions overcomplicated.
Yeah, without a lose state a game can end up missing out on a good chunk of entertainment value. Or not, it depends. Sometimes narrative flow is more important to the enjoyment of the game. Foddy certainly sells his argument well, but I have to wonder if it's just post-hoc papering over a chintzy game. Almost like the ""lore"" of FNaF.

Why modern AAA games are tending towards not losing very often seems like a simpler answer than everything here though - the devs don't want the player to have a continuity break. Forget enjoyment, their goal is engagement. With every break in progress or continuity, they might stop playing. And every time they stop playing there's a chance they might not go back to it. Like the way Chris hasn't gone back to or beaten Get Over It.

I mean, look at something like PUBG. One of the main reasons for its success over its peers was the ease of getting back into a game. It minimized the continuity break. You still had all the enjoyment of the gameplay loop, even with the loss, and the seam in the mobius strip was smoothed over just enough to not trip that ""stop playing"" threshold as easily as other games of the genre. 

So it's not hard to imagine why it's considered a mechanical failing to have players quit out of a game and never go back to it, right? Or am I missing something here?",0.9912,368

I do totally want to explore the ideas of game literacy, difficulty, and accessibility, and how they intertwine and conflict with one another, but halfway through this game I realized it was a really poor venue for that discussion.

In my case, this often comes down to a failure on the part of the game's controls or camera, or the general failure of high difficulty levels in modern games (let's just increase enemy damage and health to ludicrous levels, forget about balance!)  In most games, this really should be avoided whenever possible.  If a player is thrown into a seemingly unwinnable game situation, it can feel like they need to cheese or cheat to progress and that's definitely not a positive thing.

The difference here is that Getting Over It is designed specifically to be frustrating.

"People don't seek out hard games because they like frustration. They seek it out because they seek mastery. Different types of games appeal to different needs, and it's why different cultures tend to have different types of games. In the US everything has become about convenience and instant gratification. As a result people tend to want stuff without any hassle.

This translates into games that just let you go through by doing the most basic of inputs. The other issue is as you mention, studios create their worlds with the story and cut scenes in them, due in part to this games as movie mind set. So they expect it to be like a movie where everyone should be able to watch the whole thing. And as more casuals get into the market they too wanna go through it without hitting an impassible road block so they can see the game unfold. 

This mind set can be fine for heavy narrative driven games like Mass Effect because it's more about the story. But too many games it seems fall into this trap. And when it comes to loss/win states perhaps they should actually make the player's skill effect the story. 

Take ME1 for example, you have to pick to help whoever you sent to the AA tower or the one guarding the bomb. This is suppose to be tense and an interesting choice but it just is not because you know whoever you pick the other one dies. But if instead say you got a timer, and if you make the smart call and go for the AA tower there is a chance that if you take down the AA tower fast enough you can make it back to the bomb site to save the companion. Where as if you pick the bomb you simply hold out and the AA tower person dies taking it out since you can't leave the bomb, or maybe there is a way to seal off the enemies approach so you can secure the bomb and then if time permits make a run to the AA tower. This way someone who is really skilled can save both. 

This could be extended out in so many missions too with different levels of success effecting how things play out in the story, instead of the standard do this mission where failure is just a game over and redo screen instead of having to face those consequences. So in a way it also rewards failure as they get to see something people who were really good didn't. 

But of course his brings us back to devs put all that time into the story and they want you to see it all. It's why more and more dialogue options have the NPCs respond in exactly the same way regardless of what you say. The only difference a lot of times is you either gain or loss favor. 

A typical dialogue might go something like your companion comments on how they don't like the outfit they have to wear for the mission. Your options are ""A: It looks nice, B: It'll do for the mission, C: Yeah it looks like crap"" And the NPC's response regardless is ""Well that's just your opinion, let's get this over with."" But you favor rating with them changes based on the option you pick so say A is +10, B no change, and C is -10. The bigger the choice is when you go back and try the other options the more you release just how pointless the choice really was. 

The result is the more story based the game is the linear and easier it tends to become because they want to appeal to a wider audience. But when games rely more on actual game play with less empathize on story it's free to be about the actual gameplay and the challenge that presents, along with the great feeling of mastery that comes from conquering it. Too many non-story heavy games though fail to realize this so they follow the trend of watering things down for an easy to get through game which ends up ruining them.",0.9982,747

"So what you wrote was pretty interesting, and what I'm about to say might be me misunderstanding your intent, but here goes:

Varying degrees of accessibility exists in all forms of art and all of them have some form of elitism.

It's why Moby Dick is seen as ""higher"" literature than Harry Potter. It's why Jazz is adored by so many skilled musicians.

 Some works of art do take effort to appreciate, which many times however can heighten the resonance of the work. However the elitism expressed by some of the people who enjoy those forms of art is merely an expression of their vanity for taking the effort to understand them. I don't believe it's a byproduct of the artform itself, but merely a question on how people expresses their own achievements. The people who are arrogant about their taste in music are most likely the same people who belittles people for not understanding facets of science, or look down upon people who don't exercise as hard as them.

Any culture that prioritizes individuality, will be fixating on personal achievements in all it's shapes and forms, because it's what people uses to determine worth.

"Some of this is a bit... did we really need to cite academic sources to tell us that victory tastes all the sweeter if you actually have to put in some effort and work for it first? Like come on man, everyone already knows that. 

Anyway, while the AAA trend is to just have handholdy, easy games, there's thankfully many games that preserve a feeling of challenge still besides this one. Roguelikes are a huge trend, and besides those, there are tons of retro-styled indie games with difficulty more in line with older games. It's also impossible to not think of Dark Souls, which is hardly indie, and those games are not alone in the space between AAA and indie. Or competetive games of all kinds, where you will taste defeat just as often as victory. I'm not particularly interested in playing a difficult to control naked dude in a cauldron-platformer, but I certainly agree that difficulty is the ingredient that makes a challenge exciting to undertake instead of mindless, and I appreciate it even as I get frustrated with a death. If a game is too easy, you can just mash your way through instead of using the systems at all. That sort of experience can be soothing or entertaining in moderation, but ultimately I think it gets really dull in the long run. 

Well, everyone has a different treshold for that frustration. I remember your Dark Souls talk, you weren't exactly in love. Personally I think roguelikes are a step too far, and a huge pain because of that hard reset upon death, so I tend to avoid them. And I'm not some hardcore, challenge run dude, I tend to play games on the default difficulty, at least the first time through. But there is joy to be found in overcoming a challenge that's just right for you. Me and a mate would co-op for hours just to do the final level in Rayman Origins(Land of the Livid Dead, essentially a run to the right and jump with the correct timing type challenge), and despite eventually just sitting there swearing in chorus and getting increasingly pissed, that sort of experience is fun, too.",-0.9697,408
"Sorry for my typo(s), didn't catch that one and I did mean: ""veiled"" as opposed to the abomination that I apparently typed.

The reason for which I brought up Limbo wasn't the game itself really, just to illustrate what something minimalistic (and not strait up shit) looks like. The game, overall, isn't necessairly minimalisthic though - just the art style. Thus it's not the best example ever but it does the job of explining the concept even though it's not a 1:1 analogy of what the concept is being applied to. On second thought, Tetris would have been a far better (even though stupidly cliched) example.

Well my entier point is that this is NOT worthy of appreciation. And I presented arguments to support that claim. As for acceptance of... Well... Wtf does that mean? I obviously accept that the thing exists... But you're clearly not retarded enough to think that I don't ; or that I'm opposed to someone making whatever game they want to make... So do you mean accepting of the oppinion of people that think diffrent than I about this game? 

If so: 
1) Oppinions are not of equivalent value to one another. Exaple: the oppinion that it is ok to rape 13 year old kids is definatly inferior to the opinion that it is not ok to do so. If you disagree please call the police on yourself.
2) I belive that I have presented the reasons why I thik my oppinoin is more valuable than yours (or what is presumably yours) and you really havent done the same as far as I can tell.
3) Thus I certinly shan't accept your oppinion - your oppinion is wrong. I'm prefectly ok with *tolerating* your oppinion though - being wrong isn't the worse thing ever and it certainly doesn't directly and adversly affect me to any serious degree. And that's the threshold at which tolerance becomes self defeating idiocy.
In other words: don't worry Timmy, mommy still loves you. Even though you're a faggot and faggorty IS wrong.
An optional point 4) Me saying your oppoinion is faggotry doesn't mean I hate YOU. You are not your oppinion. I just hate the oppinion, and even than it's not really hate... It's disagreement. 

Valve used to be cool. They used to make some baller games. Not sure if they were the absolute best but they were certainly up there with the cool kids. Now they're a stupidly rich storefront. I can't blame them for it... I'd like to be stupudly rich too... They have no incentive to make games anymore.

Compare to Dark Souls: I’m an Undead in a prison and I need to get out? Okay, um, now I’m outWTFRAVEN Now where am I?! Apparently the deal in the new area is that everything sucks and the Undead (me) gotta fix everything... but there’s nothing that explicitly forces me to go fix everything (or even TELLS me that I, specifically, the player character, am the only person who could fix it). There’s no narrative pull other than the gamer’s curiosity to move outside of Firelink Shrine, and while that player-driven exploration is organic it doesn’t jive with the whole “everything’s broke and you gotta go fix it now” angle of the narrative. If I HAVE to go fix everything, why isn’t there SOMETHING that propels me to move? There are organic ways of moving the player away from Firelink that don’t ruin the game’s unique mystique; the devs could have scripted an Undead that comes, sits at the Bonfire, rests and drinks Estus, then gets up and attacks you... UNLESS YOU GO AWAY, in which case the Undead simply walks back out into the wilderness. It provides a “carnivores temporarily stop fighting each other to feed from the same kill” moment which gets ruined if the player is too passive, reinforcing the fact that everything’s gone to shit and BONFIRES KEEP YOU ALIVE BUT DON’T SOLVE THE REAL PROBLEMS. Guess you gotta go fix that world so Undead don’t have to be murderous jerks to each other! In other words, the fact that you could lounge around Firelink all you want with (at that point in the story) no narrative threads that reinforce exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it leaves the player unmoored, forcing the players to stick their nose into EVERYTHING of their own volition. You see those enemies? They won’t attack unless you do, and you’re the jerk for invading their space and murdering the Christ out of them (multiple times as a matter of fact, in case you want to farm). The player character starts as the world’s most murderous jerk in a world that’s simply struggling to survive, and only LATER do you connect the threads and realize the bigger story that is happening, which is “only you can fix this world, if you even want to fix it”.

I wanted to retch when I heard that beautiful William Blake quote being used to make this pretentious mess appear sophisticated.

Gains and losses in video games are all about context, which Getting Over It nakedly lacks (pun intended). In the real world, you're just pushing buttons, but a game can make that come to life by telling you a story that can end in many ways depending on your actions. It's not a paradox that gamers want challenging games, just a reflection of the truism that working hard for something makes it feel more special. Gamers don't want to fail; they want to succeed knowing that failure is a distinct possibility. But if playing a normal game is like cracking a shell to get at the nut, Getting Over It is just a bunch of empty shells. That may be fun if you're really bored and don't have anything better to do, but it's low-grade entertainment.

There have been so many games like this lately, games which obsessively stare into the void of metatextual commentary and equate that with philosophy.

How would you even begin to make this game easier? There's no simple 'enemy health' parameter to reduce. You would essentially have to develop a whole new mountain, adding tons of time to development, and in the end it wouldn't be representative of the developer's intent.

This really is a discussion aimed at certain types of games (mainly action games and more specifically games like Dark Souls), which have no reason not to have a reduced difficulty option other than elitism. Or perhaps some games have a legitimacy to their claims of having a point with their difficulty. That's what we should aim to figure out.

"Twice you say it's not really about skill. You did acknowledge that you do get better as you play.

While I agree that perseverance is important, the reason it's important is because without it, you don't have the opportunity to acquire the necessary level of skill. To complete the entire game is an impossible task at the base level of skill, that is, when you open up the game for the first time, or just adjusted to your input settings.

The entire game revolves around honing your skills in an imaginary craft. The Paradox of failure is no paradox. The reason we're drawn to places of many failures is because of the possibility of winning, that is, to NOT fail, where many others have.

Winning in this game gave me some of the greatest sense of pride and joy. Being able to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles with little room for mistakes and harsh punishment; it all adds to this sense.

The presence of failure amplifies your success, simply by contrast. That includes the failure of others. Of course, you wouldn't know that, having never reached the late game (unless you just didn't record it) ;)

I would say: play the game another time, learn some new strategies from good players, and see how much easier the game is. I've beaten the game in less than 5 minutes now, and I can tell you that this game has one of the purest representations of skill I've seen in a videogame. The top speedrunners baffle me.

Of course it's about skill. That much should be obvious in a game that demands you to master its mechanics to win it.",0.821,311
"Twilight Vulpine You are only half right. While it is true that difficulty was originally made with the funcion of blocking progress in mind, an art form eventually developed from the method - it wasn't just blocking progress,  it was delivering on a promised experience while putting up resistance. Additionally there are certain experiences that wouldn't work if every gave every game an easy mode. ""Getting Over It"" would lose all its meaning if it was easy to complete. Perhaps instead of demanding that games cater to your interests, you should be demanding they explore thier ideas to thier fullest extent. After all, if you think a game is too difficult for your tastes, you can always not play it, but if there are *no* games made with difficulty as a core concept... well, that's just killing a experience that someone else enjoys, isn't  it?

Just as an example,  what if someone tried to give Journey a difficult setting? It wouldn't work. Flat out, it would not work, as the game was not crafted with difficulty in mind. As Foddy would say, things are made to be used in a specific context, and once the moment has passed, they become trash. If you play the same game on different difficulties, are they *really* the same game?  They may look similar,  but the experience and the design around said experience could not be more different.  

To sum up, I would rather have one great easy game, or one great hard game. I will take that every time over 50 shades on mediocre experiences, as at least I'd know I would be experiencing the game the devs envisioned.",0.6562,316

"Video Game Challenge is often an ""I'm so smart, look at my words"" approach to video games. If you write a book and use lots of uncommon words, unnecessarily complicated grammar and poorly expressed thought you have made a book which is difficult to read but doesn't necessarily impart a profound message. Likewise, Kaizo-style games remove accessibility and while they are still games there is nothing inherently better about them. If you make a product that is intentionally obtuse, you aren't providing a revolutionary vision, it's a poorly designed item. It can be poorly designed on purpose, that can even be the point of the design, to be bad, but it is just poorly designed. There is a reason ""good"" standards for how to write exist, and these standards are constantly being updated and refined just like in video games. What Kazio games are is art, they use the medium of games, but by removing accessibility they are no different than an intentionally obtuse manuscript. Yes you can enjoy it, but there is nothing inherently special about Kazio style games or a bad translation of Kefka.

""A quick fix for the fickle, some tricks for the cliques of the feckless""? Is he serious?! He treats difficulty and frustration like it is a noble ideal that was abandoned by the lesser minds, when the absurd difficulty of games was made to create an impression of greater length at a time games couldn't be made very long, or, to get more coins out of players in the arcade.

I didn't have any difficulty in playing thatgamecompany's Journey, but that doesn't it unfulfilling. Far from it. It was a rich, unique experience. To say that games are only worthwhile if they are hard and frustrating is at best a personal preference, but as a sweep generalization, very pretentious.

Not so much  for giving a ""real"" sense of accomplishment but because they experiment with the apparent nature of games as digital spaces for infinite trial and error of beatable obstacles put forth by the designer that give you rewards at the end, which so often tends to get in the way of telling a story or expressing messages or concepts, and i feel like that's important if games are genuinely going to be art and not just augmented masturbation toys with a narrative superposed on them.

12:11 *Aaaaand* yet another jackass trying to cut out games that don't appeal to his tastes by defining them out of existence. Yep, been their before. sigh

I have to say, I don't understand the appeal of frustration. But if that's his bag, more power to him. Just don't go around saying everyone else should like it too. Myst could have used a lot less obtuse puzzle design, Space Invaders was designed to cynically suck quarters out of your pockets (and wasn't even that frustrating anyway), and the reason game designers generally consider a player leaving in frustration a bad thing is that most of the time... *it is*. A lot of the time, when someone quits a game in frustration, not only do they not come back, but they are likely to tell all their friends how shitty your game was.

So yea, apparently, according to this guy, some of my favorite games of the past few years aren't even games. And we're not even talking about the usual suspects here. We're talking about games like Bioshock: Infinite and Deus Ex here. That's a pretty douchy thing to say.",0.6313,313
"Yeah sure, waste 20 min of your life doing something tedious, that's not the game telling you you fucked up BIG TIME. 

Plus, if you farm an easy spot in DS, it is a scientific, objective fact that you are a pussy and should probably git gut. Now don't get me wrong, when the game came out for the 1st time, everyone had to get through that phase of being a morally deficient faggot of a loser. Than, through work, people got gud (or at least better). And they felt satisfaction in overcoming an obstace that inicially seemed like the biggest, baddest border wall straight out of a Mexican's nightmare. Later, people realised taht, if you know what you're doing, the game is pretty easy. And than they felt really satisfied - they had mastered a skill. 

Going back to the original point though: GOI is beatable so... You are just literally wrong. Oh and now that I think about it: remember the curse mechanic is DS1, yeah.

Maybe I’m just weird in a way unique to me, but great games get ruined for me if the gameplay and the context don’t synergize. By seeing Bennett Foddy’s point about how frustration is integral to the experience of playing games, his point comes off as highly ironic to me. Bennett literally created a game with a meta-narrative of “Frustration is what makes a game awesome, not its narrative content”. That meta-narrative synergizes so well with the game mechanics and emotional experience of the player that it makes the game a masterpiece-of-disaster of game design: a game with a meta-narrative that argues that narrative is unimportant, but without that narrative the game mechanics have no thematic weight behind the player’s actions making the game no different from the broad sea of glitchy pieces of “physics-based” garbage games that are good for nothing more than a momentary RAEG for the purposes of blowing off steam; a Bertie Botts Every-Flavor Bean in an ocean of similarly dubious culinary experiences. This is different from game jam games or games meant to help developers learn and figure out how to game design; the context behind those games is implied, and are thoroughly enjoyable in that context as a result, as seeing someone begin to master a particular craft is rewarding in and of itself. 

In short: yes, frustration is an important element of game design. But frustration without context, either narrative, meta, or implied (something I am very sensitive to, as this gigantic post makes abundantly clear), is as hollow as a game with zero frustration and all the context in the world. Both must be present. From this perspective, Gone Home is a game, because the frustration is found in simply figuring out what the bloody hell is even important. Ok, here’s a magazine. And a cassette tape. And there’s a VCR. WHAT THE F*** IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME THE PLAYER TO PROGRESS THE NARRATIVE?! That frustration is wrapped around a game themed around a player-character who returns to an old family home expecting to find the people she loves... and finding nobody there. What happened? Where did they go? What is next for the player character? Better search the house and try to find out! It so perfectly encapsulates the experience of sitting through the detritus of past ages of our lives; I have over twenty boxes of old junk that’s just sitting in storage, and it’s likely the only time that junk will finally be sorted through is when I’m dead and my family inventories said junk to then get rid of it. They will have to do what the player has to do in Gone Home: sort through the junk left behind by loved ones to figure out what happened, where they went, and what the way forward is. Context supports game mechanics supports context, creating a holistic experience. It sure isn’t everyone’s cuppa tea, but it can be defined as a video game.
