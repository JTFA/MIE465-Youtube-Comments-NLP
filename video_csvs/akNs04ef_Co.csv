"Earlier today, Me and my parents went to buy me and my friend tickets to go to Interactive Introverts, but all the tickets for the venue nearest to us were sold out, and the only seats we COULD get were single seats, not seats we could sit at side by side. Neither of us wanted to do that (in case one of us ended up sitting next to one of those people who has to use the toilet EVERY F***ING SECOND OF THE SHOW AND THINKS THAT THE PERSON NEXT TO THEM WON'T MIND IF THEY MAKE A REALLY LOUD PHONE CALL LIKE THEY'RE THE ONLY BLOODY PERSON IN THE FRICKIN THEATER!!!) so all in all, we didn't get the tickets and I'm sad now. I am now going to go sharpen a knife and hunt down one of those people online who buys all the tickets for a live show and sells online for 10000000000000000000000 times the original price.

I just wanted to say how much of a lovely person you are, you have gone through so much hardship and here you are being gorgeous. Most huge youtubers brag about their success, never tweet any fans back, livestream often while working and doing busy things. You just love, love and continue loving. You get hardly any credit for your ideas and videos yet you've called no one out, your best friend may be more successful but your here encouraging him. Dan has suffered from depression and everything while you've been there to help him work through it. Your so supportive of everyone you come across and are so polite and are never wrapped in the fact that you have millions of subscribers and are 'higher or better' than us. You treat us like long time friends.
Your just such a gorgeous human being and I can't help but admire you so much, I hope I make it to the Interactive Introverts Tour this year and get to see you. Keep being yourself because there is no one more Amazing! (Pun may be intended)!! <333333",0.9981,227
