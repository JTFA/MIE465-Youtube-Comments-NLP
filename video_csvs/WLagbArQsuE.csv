"Imagine Dragons, You may NEVER read this, but this song means so much to me. I am a single mother, who before having my son struggled with drug addiction. I have a record that should have kept me from being a nurse. I have been a CNA for 16 years. My charges were felonies marked down to misdemeanors. I graduated with my GED the month my son was born, 2 years ago. I went through the LPN class not knowing if they would let me take my state broads. Just living on a dream and many prayers going up to my Lord and Savior. I was pinned for graduating the class Dec 2017, still unaware if I would be able to be licensed.  I continued to go to school after this semester I will have 6/8 of the prerequisites for the RN bridge program that starts  Jan 2019.THEN yesterday State Bored of Nursing called me!!! They are working on a Consent Agreement (not sure what this will be yet) as soon as they send it to me, I sign and send it back, I will be cleared to take my NCLEX (State LPN TEST). After all the hard work I have put into this, the devil trying his best to break me, God shines through once again. The Lord has opened doors for me that no man could touch. I am very humbled, because even though I have worked hard at times I feel unworthy and I do not deserve this. But that goes to show you what a loving, forgiving God we serve. If nothing else has came of this I hope this shows people what the Lord can do, what you can do with the Lord, just never give up! Never give up on your dreams and goals. THIS SONG IS ON POINT WITH MY LIFE AND MY DREAMS. YOU DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I WANTED TO QUIT AND WOULD PLACE THIS SONG. THANK YOU, AND DOG BLESS!!!! <3",0.9812,374

"Thunder
Imagine Dragons
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds
Thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder
