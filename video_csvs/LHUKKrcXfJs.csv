"No, no sir, didn't like it.
If this was their debut single id avoid them forever.
Waaaay too poppy, the minor chords on the synth can't disguise this is a formulaic pop song.
I feared that their 2nd album would follow this path, but i was so so wrong, this here would not sit comfortably on their 1st two albums.
I can see Chvrches playing co headline shows in the future with the likes of Taylor swift or ed sheeran.
I want this band to be stellar, but am afraid it will appeal to the clueless pop mainstream demographic.
Hope the new album rocks and I'm proved wrong though.",-0.9178,122
