"Actually, that 97% was a cherry picked club of very carefully chosen people to use in a propaganda campaign. The United Nations hired a dozen independent scientific organizations to do research of weather data dating back hundreds of years and when these groups submitted their findings to The U.N. 100% agreed that the theory of cause and effect of ""global warming"" was a money grabbing con scam. That was also when the propaganda machines were instructed to call it ""climate change"" instead of the original con scam language of ""Global Warming"". What they found was that in about the last 150 years there has been a 1.2 degree increase in average world temperature. And then decades AFTER they started to notice a slight increase in C02 (Carbon Dioxide). That is right, boys and girls, the increase in C02 came AFTER a noticeable increase in temperature, it was not the CAUSE of increases in temperature!!! That means making billions of dollars taxing and fining and slamming us with new fees would be great to fill bank accounts, but would do ZERO to help the problem that did not in fact exist. People at The U.N. were paid off and threatened to NEVER allow these facts to become public, so do not feel out of the loop for not being allowed to hear The U.N.'s report because it was not permitted to be made public. Do some research and You will see that this is all true. There is a cool new thing called the internet where we can look stuff up.

"My Name 

Nice to see morons still exist.

We aren't going to destroy the earth.  The earth will survive regardless.  But we will make it much harder for humans to live on earth.  The changing climate is not a debate.  It's accepted by everyone, the only thing even close to debatable is whether it's caused by humans or not.  And even then everyone agrees humans cause it, it's just to what extent.

Some believe humans are the biggest cause of the rapid change and that we must change our ways to stop it.  Others believe humans have little consequence and it will continue regardless of what we do.  

Of course when I say ""believe"" I mean they have done extensive research and studies into it, it's not just a feeing.

One of the biggest problems is the ozone layer thinning.  That allows more sunlight to get in and makes the planet warmer.  Now it won't make it so warm that humans won't be able to stand the heat, in fact it would really only increase global temperatures a degree or two.  BUT, water expands as it warms.  Even if it only warms 2 degrees and the water only expands ever so slightly, it gets compounded exponentially because of him much water there is in the ocean.

I don't remember the exact statistics, but most of humanity lives by the sea, if the water all expands the sea level will rise.  Where over half the world's population lives could be underwater soon enough, forcing everyone to move inland.  Humanity is not prepared for that.

That is global warming.  There are also a lot of other issues regarding the climate, like more natural disasters, acidic rain and bodies of water, and other issues.

The Lord died for us, He took our punishment on Himself. He loves us that much. 

He rose again the 3rd day, and assured us of our redemption! Hallelujah!

Death can't hold Him down, and He won't let death hold us down either if you repent and turn to Him today. 

He will help you. He is not expecting you to clean yourself. He will do it. You just need to come to Him. He will take care of the rest. He will forgive you, wash you, and make you new, friends. 
He personally did it for me! Thank You, Jesus!

He will also deliver you from the oncoming judgement approaching this earth. He made a Way for us to escape, which is Himself on the cross for us. 

So if you don't know Jesus, please make Him Lord of your life today. You will be saved! No fancy prayer needed, just a speak from the heart.

"s‚ÑãŒµ ‚ú© A‚Ñ≥‚ÑØ‚úòh∆¥st The Central Valley and Los Angeles regions suffered through a severe heat wave for nearly two weeks. (Fresno had six days with a high temperature above 110 degrees, a new record.) More than 140 people, mainly elderly residents, died because of the extreme temperatures.

February 2005: After a winter of record precipitation, torrential rainstorms hit Southern California. The already drenched ground gave way in many places. At least nine people died as a result of the storms, most in sinkholes and mudslides.

Jan. 10, 2005: Following days of heavy rain, a mudslide swept into the small town of La Conchita, about 70 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Ten people died, and 13 homes were destroyed.

Oct. 25, 2003: An inexperienced hunter who became lost in the Cleveland National Forest outside San Diego lit a fire in an attempt to signal rescuers. The blaze, known as the Cedar fire, soon burned out of control and during the next six weeks spread to over 270,000 acres. Fifteen people died, including one firefighter. More than 2,200 houses were destroyed.
