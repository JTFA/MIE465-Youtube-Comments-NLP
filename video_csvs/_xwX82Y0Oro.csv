"My favorite parts of this choreo are:

1. At the ""Don't go look at me with that look in your eyes"" part. The dance move was great, I loved how Tina jumped up as everyone leaned back down (0:33-0:35)
2. At the very beginning when Tina's footsteps matched the beat in the song. Even though it was accidental, it was great. (0:03-0:05)
3. The ""We're nothing more than friends"" part when Tina made the finger guns (0:13-0:15)
4. The ""Don't be impolite"" part when Tina put a finger to her lips because she had the slightest smile (0:43-0:45)

Wait the guy at 1:06 on the left has a tattoo. I swear tattoos are illegal in South Korea... the law states it's illegal to practice tattooing without a license but that it's also illegal to have one. There's a whole underground community of tattooing so maybe he got it from there though,-0.8625,56
