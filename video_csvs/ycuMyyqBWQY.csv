""Hello Google,

My wife and I need new phones.  We were about to join Project Fi and buy 2 Pixel XLs, when I saw what YouTube has done to my favorite gun channels.  YouTube deleted Hank Strange’s entire YouTube channel, and 900 of his videos.  You also almost did the same thing to Military Arms Channel, despite the fact that neither of these channels actually violated YouTube’s terms of service.  That changed my plan quickly, and I’ve decided to seek another service provider for my phones and services.  I will never do business with Google.  I will make sure that Google never has an opportunity to make a cent from me.  This is me voting with my wallet.  You lost $1,200 of phone sales and a lifetime of phone service from me for what you’ve done.  I hope that hurts.  I hope other people like me, who have had enough of your hypocritical bullshit, will do the same.  I hope you go out of business.  There’s no place in our country of freedom for a social media outlet that will claim that it honors “freedom of opportunity, freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom to belong,” yet will delete channels to promote a political agenda.

   Personal Liberty should be paramount. I should be at liberty to choose which content to watch or not watch. Creators should be at liberty to create or not create by their Choice. You/YT have decided to make my choice for me. This is unacceptable.
   I am just one, but one of many, who enjoy and learn from various subjects presented on YT. Several of the categories are presently under stifling scrutiny with entire channels being terminated. A number of these subjects are a staple of American Freedom and personal Liberty.

"When I first got started with YouTube, I earned a few cents...one month later YouTube announced a prerequisite for monetization: 10k views across your channel. I surpassed 10k views on my channel back in December of 2017. Messages from YouTube went like this: Congratulations your account will be reviewed for approval. This message went on for three months despite my emails. YouTube has once again taken monetization out of my reach by no fault of my own. My account has always been in good standing, and yet YouTube continues to alienate content creators through selfish policy decisions. YouTube will stimulate it's own demise.",0.7978,116

You CONSTANTLY Demonize channels that provide Reviews and Opinions on Legal Devices and issue Strikes (and have recently TERMINATED) for Years old video content.  And, ALL of this happens after a highly publicized tragedy.  

I submit that you need to change your CORE BELIEFS from what they are to ""Let Them Live In Freedom Only If They Live Like Me""
