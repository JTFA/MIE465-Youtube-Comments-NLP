"A fantastic track, to be sure, but can someone explain to me why they would elect to produce an ""official lyric video"" that is so utterly propagandized?  This video repeatedly shows the iconography of the single greatest threat to democracy that the western hemisphere had suffered in the past century.  There is absolutely no place for any pro-Cuban content to exist on Youtube, or *any* social media platform so long as that oppressive regime maintains such a greviously unapologetic human rights record and continues to espouse the Marxist notions that have been the bane of the Earth since their inception.  The very fact that Major Lazer should produce an entire documentary in that cesspool of an island is unbelievable.  Shame on you, Diplo.  Maintain the embargo.",-0.8717,140
