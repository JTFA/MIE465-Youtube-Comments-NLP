"Notice how so many of these famous (and ""powerful"") men are conventionally unattractive (and even borderline-disgusting). 

Workplace sexual harassment is called workplace flirtation, when _and only when_ it's consensual. And she isn't going to consent, if you're a wheezing, balding, overweight slob. It's not hard to understand. Virtually all of the serial offenders, some whose reported actions were more henious than others, were substandard in sexual appeal: Hockenberry, Louis CK, Franken, Rose, et al. This is to say to say nothing of the rare and more pathetic among them -- Cosby, Weinstein, Ailes, O'Reilly, et al -- who chose (or resorted to?) actual, literal, systematic sexual predation.

*I'll keep waiting for the harassment charges against guys like George Clooney and Brad Pitt.* Something tells me there won't be an avalanche of those. Something tells me you'd be hard-pressed to even find a handful of them ... if they even exist at all. I don't remember Big Ben having to leave the Steelers in shame. Wasn't he dealing with rape allegations, at some point? 

This whole campaign seems more like a culling of deluded beta men who don't 'know their place' in the sexual heirarchy. It seems less about the 'harassment is bad' message, and more about accusers' being disgusted by slovenly ""creepy"" betas, as well as well-past-their-prime alphas, *and their sad failed attempts to imitate Don Draper* once those men got a little bit of power. (You might recognize that the 'alpha-beta' dichotomy is silly and problematic -- the message still ought to be clear.)

For it to actually be considered harassment or assault advances/behavior have already been dismissed (generally) by the victim, but the individual continues the behavior. In most cases the one commiting the crime is in a position of power and the victim feels threatened or ashamed. Mr. Batali even admitted his actions as well as apologized publically (genuine or not) because he understands it is not acceptable. Now on to personal thought not fact; I'm guessing your motivated to dismiss the behavior since you've made women uncomfortable in the past and didn't like their responses.
