"@The Modern Rogue, you can probably solve this by
1) Switching to limes. Limes will give you more acid/acidity. This will help increase both capacity and current.
2) Increasing the number of batteries you hook up in parallel. This will help increase current.
3) Increasing the surface area of the metal you use. Try sheets instead. This will help increase both capacity and current.
4) Disconnecting the indicator LED, which is just a waste of energy for this experiment.",0.9246,96

"Here are a few things that I think might help you out a bit. If you can determine what the capacitance of your capacitor is you will be able to determine how much charge is stored in the capacitor. This equation is q=CV where q is the charge (in coulombs) C is the capacitance in Farads (you will probably need to convert from microFarads to Farads) and V is the voltage. Since you know what the voltage of a AAA battery is and if you can determine the capacitance of the capacitor you will know what amount of charge is required to fully charge the capacitor. 

After attaching the lemon battery to the capacitor, you will need to measure the amperage flowing into the capacitor (clamp on gauge works best for this and can be found at any hardware store). Now, amperage is just a measure of the amount of charge flowing per time (Coulombs/second) and by knowing the amperage and the amount of coulombs required to charge the capacitor the required amount of time to charge the battery can be determined. (Amperage=Coulombs/second-------plug in amperage and required coulombs from equation q=CV). This will give you a rough guess so that you don't have to sit around for 24 hrs waiting to charge  if it should charge in just an hour. 

Another issue that I believe that you are having is that the LED is acting as a short circuit and is allowing any charge that you might be building up to dissipate through it. I would attempt to remove any unneeded components in the stun gun to prevent any parasitic loss. I would also increase the number of lemons and connect in parallel (to increase amperage). Another method could be to try different household items that might be able to provide a larger current. I have not tried these but it intuitively makes sense to use more of a liquid to increase amperage due to the increased mobility of the electrolytes in the solution. (Try Coca-Cola, salt water, bleach or lemon juice)",0.9161,383

"Hi Aircraft Mechanic here, Basic concept of a battery comes from a chemical reaction between the two metals. layman term is that the metal is corroding and your controlling how it corrodes and using the current from the corrosion. To get a better volts and amps you need more dissimilar metal also known as ""GALVANIC"". Very important term when it comes to batteries. The whole point of them lemon is to be a electrolyte to pass current from one metal to the other. Obviously there are better electrolytes to use.

"Not to be a party pooper here, but i gotta correct you. galvanized zinc on steel is not to actively avoid but to counteract the reaction with steel. In short: zinc will corrode EASIER than steel, so when there is a crack in the zinc coating, both zinc and steel (Fe) will react, but zinc will have a greater tendency to do so, and will make the iron in steel return to metallic form by giving it its electrons from the zinc reaction. The other way around is also not bad, because the coating will stay longer, but the same way zinc keeps the steel from reacting, it will once theres an opening, accelerate the corrosion of the steel.

TLDR: the more amps, the faster it charges, parallel batteries gives more amps.

Full: the time it takes for a capacitor to charge (with constant current) is VC/I so if you give more amps, the faster it charges. Batteries in series gives more voltage, batteries in parallel gives more current. So, stack a bunch of lemons in parallel to get somewhere in the right amp range and you should be good to go, it would take 2,000 to match a  AAA, but 100 should give you a charge time of close to 3 minutes or so",-0.0387,120

"To the modern rouge:
Measure the voltage while under load (charging something)

To the poor people without a cheatcode:
""We've got some voltage""
Due to internal/parasitic resistance voltage will drop (severely in this case, this ain't a battery) when under load, always*. 1.6V for some LEDs is stretching it; To over-simplify it: LEDs attempt to regulate the current flowing through them so don't worry about supplying .5 volts too much.

""100 Volts :D""
*wires up a LED*
""2V (!?)""
*pro tip, just buy batteries, cheaper, smaller, last longer, more powerful, less resistance....

""Voltage is cumulative?""
For high voltage
yes, if you wire it properly -- in series, or + to -
For high amperage or current
nope, in parallel, or all +'s (anodes (zinc)) together and all -'s together (cathodes (copper))

""Only one way""
Yes, as you've learned from experience: LEDs, or Light Emitting Diodes emit light when current flows through, which in turn only flows when you have the correct polarity; Diodes block current flow in the wrong/backward direction (up to a point), drop some voltage (Vf or forward voltage) in the correct direction.",0.3878,256

One other point to keep in mind is that lemon batteries go flat fairly quickly by deposits building up on the electrodes.

batteries have a higher amperage which is one reason why your LED lit up on the battery at a lesser voltage. If you make a couple of resistors in between the Amp rating you can essentially light up the green led at the base 1.8V they were rated for. Also the reason that the camera stun gun works is due to the amperage that is created by the circuit within the camera. There are a series of Resistors that are used to essentially change the current. If you want to do a test you can add in resistors in between each battery and test the change in current. Capacitors are used within a camera to allow the flash to charge. the release of the capacitor gives a higher current than if you were to just touch both ends to what you are shocking.,-0.2263,151

"half sortof electrical engineer here: What you did at the end should have been entirely correct, and the spark kind of proves it (the battery in wrong way doesn't do diddely dit). The reason you didn't feel anything on the arm is because tissue isn't really all that conductive. You require a fairly high amount of voltage (Which accumulates as you charge it) to establish a connection through tissue. Proper tasers will output 50000 volts for a brief moment just to establish a connection, and immediately lower itself to 1200v once the currents starts flowing to not actually kill the guy.
