"Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Stop playing with your body, lady
Stop feeling like you're not enough
Stop feeding into the haters
Stop and give yourself some love (woah)
Stop staring at the mirror getting faded
Saying you won't fall in love
Stop trusting in those fake idiots
Trust me they don't give a fuck (woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of seeing it
I'm tired of feeling this
The world says beauty is changing
Fuck that it's fake expectation, not the real shit
Let's get naked
Start meditating, feel elevated and say

[Chorus]
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen

[Verse 2]
Stop chasing all the hype, my girl
Stop trying to change who you are
Stop cutting yourself up on the outside (outside)
When the inside is never scarred
It can't be healed with something materialistic
Can't be healed by a man who stays distant
It's deeper
Save yourself, before you betray yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of seeing it (so tired)
I'm tired of feeling this (so)
The world says beauty is changing
Fuck that it's fake expectation, not the real shit
Let's get naked (let's get naked)
Start meditating, feel elevated and say

[Chorus]
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen

[Bridge]
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen
I love my body, I love my skin
I am a goddess, I am a queen
