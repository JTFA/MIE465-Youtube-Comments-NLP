Like, Alice might imagine* moving her right hand left or right, while Bob might imagine lifting the corresponding arm, and Carol might imagine rotating her left hand (with her arm as the axis), and as long as you're consistent in how you think about it, it should work.

This raises the question of whether our brains can just extend itself to, basically, allow new limbs- could I move a box on a screen just as easily as I move my arm, but independently? That is, could I have a thought pattern that corresponds to moving the box which does _not_ conflict with other limbs- so I could use my arms and legs at the same time as my mind powers??

Your hypothesis might get every prediction you've ever tested correct, but then it turns out you've missed some tests and variables and what you really have is just a good estimate and not the full facts. (*Cough* Sorry, Newton... *Cough*).

However, you can very easily *disprove* something: all you need is one example of a time when the conditions of the prediction were true, but the results were not as predicted. A single contradiction disproves an idea.

So that's why the null hypothesis is so important: if you set out to try and prove your idea, it'll be basically impossible, but if you set out to disprove the opposite idea -- the idea that predicts the opposite of what your actual hypothesis is -- then you can do that easily with a single experiment.

(Also, before anyone brings it up: unfalsifiable claims don't count. They're not science. It can be shown through a chain of simple logic alone that anything which is unfalsifiable in theory also cannot possibly exist, so there's no need to test them before dismissing them.)",0.8357,230

"Tom, I love your videos, but I have to say I was hoping you'd say more about why things are done this way (and _why_ negative findings don't get published). 

The whole idea of the ""rejecting the null hypothesis"" has always bothered me. In practice scientists are actually trying to ""assert some specific hypothesis"" but can't put in in quite those terms because of the long tradition of framing the publication of science in terms of logical positivism. It's so bizarre but it's this special kind of academic word game. Basically, ""I can't say that it's true, cause we don't say that, so I'll say that it's not _not_ true."" Am I missing something?",-0.4943,133

"When people say that science and religion don't go together, and in fact, are polar opposites, this is what they reference.
You cannot assume a hypothesis to be true unless proven, for disproving a hypothesis devoid of evidence is impossible; You need evidence to disprove an evidence-less hypothesis.
Religion assumes something to exist without any ability to prove it does.
All forms of science, with the partial exception of those built around discovery (theoretical physics, for instance), are based on the concept of proof before belief.
