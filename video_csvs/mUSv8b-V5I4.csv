Dealer will try desperately to sell it for 60-70k, but nobody smart or in their right mind will pay that when it's got 50,000 miles and kid damage all over the place. It will gradually work its way down to the lower class used car lots at which point, depending on where it is, it will either be bought by some poser trying to look rich to his 25 year old friends and end up crashed or totaled, or a Mexican to whom it will exist as a symbol of the American dream made possible, in all of its tattered leather, failing tablet screen, yacht club blue now gray with the march of time glory.  But our fine minority driver, temporarily blinded by the newness of this peculiar American experience, but otherwise intelligent and hardworking, will part ways with it as well. Now it's fate is sealed, death is now imminent. Someone may give it an auto-zone aftermarket makeover, before finally coming to rest in some trailer park dwellers carport, unable to move after it's rims have been stolen for the 3rd time.
