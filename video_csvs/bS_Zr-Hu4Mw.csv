"Hi there, I dyed my hair the other day at the salon. My roots we like a ashy dark brown and the ends a orange red tones. I dyed it so many time trying to get to my natural color, big mistake. I got some dyes that were Ash tone but still my hair would turn red tones. Why is it that? My hair is a brown pushing more towards like a light blonde golden tone. So I show my hair to stylist, I guess she missed understood me she colored my hair to the color of the ends. I am so unstastified not happy with hair. Please help me what can I do? I can't afford to go to a salon. Also I just had a baby breastfeeding. What can I do.",0.5744,148
