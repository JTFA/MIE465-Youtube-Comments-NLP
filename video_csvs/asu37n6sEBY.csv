"Again, I have no idea what your point is.

I am not claiming to be perfect. I simply stated to follow the ONE whom IS Perfect, that is Jesus Christ.

Jesus is going to save you, not yourself, or country music, or a Confederate flag, but the PURE Blood of Jesus, friend.

If you Loved God, He would know. You do not have to convince me, I am no one but a follower of Jesus Christ. If you love God, again, HE will know.

Shalom.",0.968,104

"Tryin' To Untangle My Mind
Chris Stapleton
LYRICS
Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I made a little money, I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind
Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
That the good lord spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge, and I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind
So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil loved me high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind
Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I do what I do, 'til the day I die
No heartache for the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind
If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil loved me high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind
