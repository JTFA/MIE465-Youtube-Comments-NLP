"I had health problems that happened to me at a young age, 18. I had hyperthyroidism, they had tried to contain it at a safe level for them to remove my thyroid but that didn't happen. I had what I thought was just a flu but I was actually going through a thyroid storm. I waited too long to go to the hospital. The treatment I needed had to be done else where. So they flew me to Denver, CO. A painful week in the ICU, and another 5 weeks in the hospital, never got to spend the holidays with family. Now that I had my thyroid removed. The weight gain caught up to me. Not giving a shit about recovery, I jumped right into the gym. Set a strict diet, my starting weight was 180. That journey started when I was 18, now I am a healthy 130 lbs 20 year old soon to be a police officer. 💪💪",0.3818,181
