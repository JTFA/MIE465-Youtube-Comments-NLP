It was hilarious to watch them madly batting at each through the glass but since it stressed my cat, I'd go out to chase the other cat.

"Speaking as someone who has studied cat behaviour, Nicky hasn't said anything that is too far wrong.  The domestic cat's lineage has been traced back to the wild cats in Africa and the Middle East, and they are extremely territorial. I will admit that they are not as solitary as most would believe, whether that's something we are just starting to understand or if it's cats have been adapting to living with humans is still up for debate.
As for the cat who was stressed out, not only had she been playing with him during the segment but they were filming at the Cats Protection which is a shelter (no matter how nice we try to make shelters, they will always cause some stress) and there was the full film crew who would not only be strangers but have scary things (equipment) around them. That cat was probably the least stressed one they could find. 
I've been through lectures on cat behaviour which go for three hours and barely scratch the surface of the subject, these videos are 10 minutes long to give cat owners a little insight into why their cat behaves the way he or she does. They are actually pretty good for what they are trying to do.",0.5834,228

"We once had a problem with a neighborhood cat coming into our home and eating our cats food. We solved this by locking our hatch so it could only be used to get in, and when the foreign cat got caught inside, in the bathroom (where the cat flap was) we gave sprayed some water on it and let it out, havent had any problems with that cat since.",0.1675,76

"When my last cat was young, about a year maybe two, he got out and stayed out for 3 days. We'd see him around and it kinda looked like he was hanging out with the neighbourhood cats. We figured because he was young and fixed they didn't see him as a threat or rival so they tolerated him.",-0.2911,63

"my cats are loosing their territory from it being nearly exclusively theirs to them sharing it with the cats of the neighborhood due to their loss in numbers , we use to have more than 10 cats that were all family descending from several other cats including a few kittens that we got from friends. now we're just down to two and a stray female i've gotten use to us, i think at this point she's almost adopted me as her human (at least part time) since i'm the one spending the most time with her, unforentally she doesn't get along with our tomcat but he's known his entire life that his humans are in charge and listens to us when we tell him to back down from a fight with a queen , at least most of the time, but he knows at this point it's him who's getting put back inside.",-0.2732,160

"üòÇThis is how I got Sandy!
I had one cat (Maki) and since I worked nights I left out food and water for her.
Apparently Sandy figured out how to get into my trailer thru a vent and was helping himself to her food.
I discovered this when sleeping during the day.....only to hear Maki eating....but Maki was on my bed!
After 2 months of this I caught him and got him neutered!

He is now a fat fur baby.
But he did give me a few good scars!",0.7405,103
