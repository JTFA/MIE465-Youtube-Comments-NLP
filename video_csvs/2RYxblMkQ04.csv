"As a former Wendy's employee, they aren't lying about this. The meat is kept at pretty cool but not freezing temps, and they get shipments twice a week since it is their main selling food.

"BY4L X chicken doesn't sell as much as burgers. It's harder to schedule out the amounts when they fluctuate often. I've worked days where crispy chicken barley sells in the summer, but no matter what we use around 560 junior patties every day. And around maybe 200-300 singles a day in times during Vacation. Some days we only sell crispy chicken, some days it homestyle, spicy may be able to be never frozen. But Wendy's is about consistency and accuracy while getting it done as fast as possible for the customer. It's not easy to make a faster and easier way to do grill procedures. It's hot, and if your not carful you'll burn yourself more than once a day. Protective gear does exist, but the last thing you want is to be behind on grill during rush. It will kill a drive though timer quicker than a 15 yr old who flunked math on back window who can't count change. Point is everybody works hard, some more than others. But our goal is quality. Fresh. Food. I got McDonald's today and they smashed my bun on my chicken sandwich. I have only done that to a customer when they get a number 3 large with 3 strips of bacon added and extra everything, we have to use 2 wraps just to wrap it. Can't wait for summer rushes, paychecks gonna be nice.",-0.7788,258

Bruh you got some pretty terrible knowledge on salt. NaCl (salt) is essential for pretty much all chemical signaling in the body. People are told not to drink see water because the massive concentration of salt compared to water dehydrates them. But dying of dehydration from salt intake isn't really a problem if you just drink regular water when you become thirsty...,0.698,68

Wendy's - You have the best burger's by far. You have the best frostys by far. #BUT# - --- You miss the mark on your d√©cor and presentation.

"stop telling people you use fresh never frozen beef. you don't. all fast food is frozen. stores only get deliveries 1-2 times a month and you cannot keep thawed beef that long. you would need daily deliveries to every store in the franchise which is financially impossible, and would cause the cost of the food rise so much nobody would buy. you would have raise the price to compensate for the added trucks and shipping, drivers pay, the food itself as well as manufacturing costs included in producing the food. fact is you use frozen beef, quit with the false advertising. 

and stop with the sea salt, it's not good for you. it's a scam. NO salt is good for you. what's the first thing people are told when they go to the ocean, don't drink the water the salt will kill you. now that same sea salt is good, no. it's a scam. besides to get technical, all salt comes from sea water deposits. it just depends on if it's younger and unfiltered, or older and had time to be diluted by fresh water rain and natural vitamins and minerals.",-0.964,215
