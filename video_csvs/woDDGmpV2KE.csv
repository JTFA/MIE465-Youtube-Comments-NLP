Implying that BTS is known for their vocals or their stability in live singing... what they do isn't special, and it's definitely not unique to only them.

honestly tho, their 2017 songs are musically weak and it's obvious they just wanted to please the American taste. it's bland and so overhyped. there are tons of other boy groups' songs that are so much better.",0.9502,98
"Jennifer Choi that's cool that they're like underdogs and hardworking and all that. Good for them but like I said before, I gain no sense of satisfaction when they perform.",0.9224,33

BTS is charting so well because they're so good at keeping those armys crazy (with fanservices and interactions), so that they will keep on spamming comments about BTS in many social media platforms, and urge people to vote on their biases. that's why i said BTS' success comes mainly from armys and their agency's genius marketing.

if we're talking about music OBJECTIVELY, their 2017 songs are musically weak and bland. predictable. so, the reason why they are charting so well right now, it's NOT because their songs are musically great and complex, but because armys do a great job at hyping them (by constantly voting, streaming youtube views, spamming comments).

btw i'm not surprised, you're such a typical new army lol.",0.8595,148

"Jinx Winters ‚ÄúHighly commercial pop‚Äù? They cover genres such as hip hop/rap, edm, pop, rock, contemporary r&b. 
‚ÄúManufactured?‚Äù Maybe other Kpop groups, but not BTS. They are not idols, thy are artists. A lot of BTS fans are not general Kpop fans, so that just shows how different their musicality is. No other artists/groups in the world can pull off what BTS is doing, not even other Kpop groups.
‚ÄúBig enough money and social media?‚Äù LMAO what money... they come from a small unknown company that had a huge debt when BTS first debuted. These 7 goofy talented guys had to sleep in a one-room apartment in the beginning of their career. It was so hard to promote their music, so that‚Äôs why they took advantage of social media. They had to build their way to the top, been grinding since 2013 and they have come so far.

Lastly, NO ONE is comparing BTS with Kendrick Lamar and Lana del Rey (artists who I also respect). You shouldn‚Äôt put down other artists who work just as hard just so your favorites could shine.

"SamDoesStuff >""unless you've actually cared enough to research them, don't reply with trash answers""
>""BTS is 100% better than most American artists these days""

Looool. The hypocrisy is actually tangible. You don't know shit about what other ""American artists"" have gone through, about their creation process, about how much effort they put into their artistry because exactly as you said, you couldn't care less about them. So you feel comfortable about generalizing the entire genre of American music and saying that your bias is better than them (with no evidence whatsoever), while you lash out at others doing the EXACT SAME THING as ""trash""? lmaooo. This is why people like you don't often get taken seriously. You just cannot form a coherent, logical argument. 

Let's imagine that BTS held a concert and posted a trailer of it on YouTube. One of the comments is from a fervid Exo-L saying ""tbh I couldn't care less about BTS. Only Exo keeps me sane. Also Exo is 100% better than BTS, fight me."" 

You, and other ARMYs reaction to that would be either a) get terribly offended, b) say ""guys just ignore them, it's just a stupid troll!"" c) say something like ""if you like Exo so much why are you even here commenting on a BTS vid? Just go and watch Exo and leave BTS alone!"", or some variation of that.

..you can see my point, right? All of those would apply just as well for your current actions. Absolutely fucking delusional.",0.7145,303

"beselbic Mario Ballestero i bet you didn‚Äôt even look them up or know anything about their history. They are not One Direction where their popularity blew up all of a sudden. These guys have been grinding since 2013. People from their teens to adults in their 30s love and respect BTS because they‚Äôre are talented and hardworking. Their journey wasn‚Äôt an easy one. They always have to prove people wrong. Even people in their own country were saying how BTS was gonna be a flop when they first debuted because they weren‚Äôt from a well-known label. BTS is beyond K-pop. ‚ÄúKpop isn‚Äôt a big enough category for me‚Äù- Suga (BTS member, rapper). Most BTS fans aren‚Äôt K-pop fans, so that just shows how different their musicality is from other Kpop groups. BTS writes and produces their own music. Everything they do is INTENTIONAL, from the symbolisms in their music videos all the way to their fashion on stage. You have no idea how meaningful and deep their music is. These guys talk about big topics such as mental health, economic problems, self-love, motivation, etc. These 7 humble dorks have a passion for music and the arts. They don‚Äôt take anything for granted and are always wanting to learn new skills (drawing, photography, how to edit videos, cooking, etc).

They‚Äôre overrated? Hate to break it to you, but these guys are just getting started. Thanks to social media, people everywhere around the world can recognize talent and BTS just happens to be that. *Remember*: BTS didn‚Äôt come looking for fame in America, America came looking for them.
