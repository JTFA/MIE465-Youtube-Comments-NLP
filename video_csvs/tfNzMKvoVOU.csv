Are we just gonna act like regular schools dont teach us anything anyways? Theres a kid in my class graduating with his degree already at 18. He was self taught and home schooled for most of high school and he is honestly the smartest kid in the classes i have with him. He said high school was a waste of time for him and all the teachers would piss him off amd literally teach crap.

"As a current student of an online charter school (Connections Academy), I can validate that this is true. I have been in the school for almost 3 years now. I am going to graduate this June. And I will tell you, that *it is not for everyone*. In the beginning of 10th grade, I went into Online School thinking that I can go my own pace - that I don't have to try as hard. But that's not the case. You have to have a learning coach, which for me is my Mother who is gone most of the day working. So, it is up to me to get my work done completely. Managing your time is hard considering that there is no one there to keep you on schedule. This has caused me to fail my math classes, ultimately making me not even do them anymore. I take classes that you'd typically take when you need extra credit in Public Schools. 
There were many times where I regretted making the decision to transfer, but since I'm about to graduate, I can't back out now. 
While there are a lot of students who don't put in the effort to work hard in online schools - i.e. not going to test locations, there are many who do put a lot of effort to get good grades. They're always on time for live lessons and weekly calls with our teachers. And of course, finishing a course 2 months before it's due. (which is what I'm trying to do rn, wish me luck) It's really a 50/50 chance on whether you fail in the school. The teachers are very willing to help you, you just need to put your effort into it. (but like in any other school, the teachers can't /force/ you to learn)

I can see a slight flaw. If they do open more schools and add more staff so the kids can get the feedback from the teachers they should do better. The other flaw is the learning st your own pace method of thinking. Kids don't understand deadlines at yonger ages so if they do an online school you would need twice the supervision to make sure they meeting goals. So yes have a 'choice' but the online schooling just needs more work done just like traditional school,0.7812,93
"I can't say anything for or against online schools other than to say they were never an option for me. My family didn't have reliable internet access until I was already in high school. 

But I don't think I missed out. My local public school district was great. I think it may have become worse since my graduation, but at the time, it operating well. The rigidity and routine of my public school upbringing was really a boon for me. It was a calm environment where I had space to learn and work, access to mentors and positive role models, built friendships with many different people from all walks of life, and was able to engage in extracurriculars. Even though I was (am) an ugly weirdo, nobody ever bullied me for it. Meanwhile, my home was a chaotic, dysfunctional disaster in every way, and I could never concentrate there. If I hadn't attended a school outside of my home, I would never have been able to learn a thing. I did most of my homework at school during free moments of the day, and the rest on the bus or at public parks outside of my home. Even though I was poor, even though my attendance was occasionally spotty and my health issues made me underperform in my later years, I was able to take advanced classes in subjects that interested me from as early as first grade, and I have yet to find another institution that has been as inspiring and beneficial to my self improvement since graduating.

There are definitely issues with public schools, but I don't think the solution is to abandon them completely for another model. I think, with proper funding and community support, with passionate teachers and savvy administrators, public schools can be an asset for society.",0.9565,336

I was a straight-A student before that, and online schooling was my only option if I wanted to graduate, or generally further my education. This isn't a commentary on the quality of education, I just think it's important to note that such schools aren't just a ""parental choice"" or to further competition in the education field, but a genuine last option for so many people like me who are genuinely incapable of getting their education from the more typical public settings you name as alternatives.",-0.6802,209

Consider the fact that public school really has not changed in the last 100 years (as stated in the video), we know the world has changed a ton...it is time for public schools to keep up  with those changes. My kids are elite athletes and work from 6a to 10p most days - similar to a regular work day. School of choice has allowed them to excel in their dreams as well as academically. Both are A / B students and test well above state average in standardized tests. They spend hours a day on the standard subjects, but actually get to drive the learning. If they understand a topic they can move on, instead of waiting for the mass student body (32-35 kids in a room) to get the topic. If they don't understand a topic, they are provided with two and three additional sources, as well as personalized instruction time with the teacher. The structure of online school is geared toward the success of the student.  I will agree, online school is not for everyone. If your student is not driven to succeed or able to follow a schedule and be self directed other options would be wise. That's why school of choice is the best choice - It is all about what is best for each individual student.",0.985,269

"I went to normal public school for 1st through 8th grade, then about 2 months of 9th grade at the normal public high school before transferring to a vocational school for the rest of the year. Come 10th grade I transferred again to a new charter school, before heading back to normal public school for the second half of 10th grade.

Both the normal charter and the vocational school had terrible academics and I was bored all the time, often opting to read during class instead of paying attention because it was mostly stuff I learned in middle school (and during the times I learned new material, it was covered agonizingly slowly so it made more sense to read it from the textbook in the first 10 minutes of class and then go back to doing my own thing). I bet their test scores would reflect their poor classes and sometimes I feel really bad that many of the kids there were/are missing out on a good education, especially because many of them were comjng from a nearby district that didn't exactly have the best public elementary + middle schools so they were already behind even before going to the charters. 

Eventually I convinced my parents to finally let me try online school and enrolled in one called 21st Century Cyber Charter School (21CCCS) that I BELIEVE was specific to our state. Once a day there was a ""live"" class (a livestream through Blackboard, generally with a main PowerPoint presentation led by the teacher, the ability for everyone to speak via microphone, group activities in breakout rooms, and a few other things) or sometimes twice a day depending on your courses' schedules. There were ""office hours"" for teachers throughout the day so if you needed help, you'd just pop into that program to get instruction through video/audio/IM. Courses themselves were a mix of projects and tests like normal school but could be completed any time within the quarter--and as long as you at least logged in each week, you were fine, so sometimes I'd put off tons of work until the last week, or would complete almost an entire class in only a few days in the beginning. You weren't limited to a 7-to-2 schedule so I'd often keep doing schoolwork pasr sundown so I would have the daytime hours to play games. They also sometimes had field trips and activity days in person, sometimes held at their multiple physical offices around the state (so students from each region could go to their respective places). I didn't go to very many because I don't like socializing, but I did go to one where we did mock forensics work and solved a ""crime"" that was really fun lol.

Anyway, the quality of academics were in-between the level of our public school and the 2 brick-n-mortar charters I attended, with a workload closer to the charters. I ended up dropping out due to boredom and a dispute over them not accepting my college science credits about 3 months before graduation but it was definitely the best school I attended for high school. A lot less stressful and the teachers were wonderful (well, except for 1 us gov teacher, but she ""left""[?] after the 1 quarter I had her so it worked out). I was severely depressed throughout high school and it was a breath of fresh air to be able to sleep well, try new medications and not have to worry about side effects impacting school life, etc. 
I would not suggest online schooling to anyone who needs hand holding though; you're not going to have someone in the room with you making sure you're doing your work so you need to be able to do it on your own, and also if you struggle with reading issues you're going to have to work a lot more since lessons and activities are predominantly reading. And if you think you couldn't handle the temptation of social media in the middle of a math quiz, it's not for you either. Also, because it has a way of disconnecting you from your peers, I honestly would not suggest it for elementary or even middle schoolers. I'd be worried it would stunt their emotional growth if they started cyber school  that young...",0.9881,793

"I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with every single point you make in this video. I go to an online charter school because of severe social anxiety and the fact that I can't keep up with public's school brutal workload that they give to SMALL CHILDREN. Maybe, just maybe, you could take into the account that not all children are exactly the same. Some work faster, some can't handle being around up to 1000's of other kids they don't know, they will throw up and hyperventilate. Also, the grades thing is bullshit. The average grade for every assignment I've ever done at my online school is literally an A+. Give kids a chance to learn how THEY want, and they will excel. It's really sad that such close-minded adults try to say things like this, that aren't the kids trapped in a prison for children 7 hours a day, all forced to learn the exact same things.",-0.9683,178

"I've been taking online school this year (11th grade) and it's going well for me. I left traditional school due to depression and anxiety. Every day driving to school I'd cry and sometimes have full blown mental breakdowns. I'd also skip school a lot. I seriously considered dropping out. Now, my anxiety doesn't interfere with my education as much as before. I'm taking 3 classes online, each class being about 3 hours. So a big downside is having around 9 hours of school. But now I don't live in fear each day and I'm learning the same things that I would in traditional school.",-0.8152,117

Kids shouldn't have to go to schools that aren't good or don't work well for the way in which they learn(Which is different for different kids). But they should have to go to school. I shudder to think what I might be like if someone had given me my way when I was a kid and just allowed me to not go to school at all. And I just see this being used as a thinly veiled way for that to happen.

"My daughter did Connections Academy for  few years while we were in Las Vegas. I had issues with the public school there so we tried homeschooling her, that didn't work so after 2 years we went to Connections, that wasn't much better. I don't blame the school though, the reason we had trouble home schooling and online school was, my daughter was lazy and she would do no work all semester then try to do it all in the last week and stress out because she couldn't catch up. We moved her to regular public school when we moved to Oregon in what would have been her Senior year. She did better but still failed classes for not doing the work. She became a 5th year Senior and finally graduated, barely. I'm not defending the school it was not an ideal education for her, it was just the best we had at the time. When she had the option to take the High School equivalency in her Sophomore year which is the first time it is available, she passed everything on the first try. With all of her inability to do any work she was still smart enough to get the basics, but if she hadn't been it would have been a lot worse for her in the long run.",-0.9091,237
"My daughter did K12 for fourth grade. She had been in the advanced math class at her regular elementary school, but was not placed in one with K12. She was told that, if she finished the entire year's math curriculum before January, they'd give her the next year's curriculum. She finished it in late November, and we spent months trying to get them to follow through with their promises - they didn't. I had her do Khan Academy for her math, but when we returned her to a regular school, they refused to accept it as an advanced credit and placed her back in the regular classes. She's now in advanced reading and science, and will be in honors social studies when she starts high school next year... But because of that one year of not only being held back in math, she's stuck in the regular math classes, even though the teachers know she's capable of doing the harder work. It quickly became obvious to us that they were just as guilty as teaching to the test as anywhere else - if not more so. Once she was able to meet the requirements for the test, they didn't care if she continued her education or not. It was all about funding money to them.",0.9023,235

"Ok Vox, I usually agree with you. (Yay for the less than 1% me), I attended online charter school for the majority of my elementary and middle school ~7 years. I think that it worked for A LOT of people around me and with the combination of a homeschool co-op (look it up) it gave me a lot of options that frankly aren't available in public school, such as >5 field trips a year. I understand that I was extremely lucky because my mom stayed home and helped teach me, but I can say that it benefited me when I went to public high school, because I lost a lot of the free time and autonomy to write papers and go on field trips that interested me. However, I cannot say that it would work for everyone, but honestly what does. I still had to take standardized testing although I passed those with flying colors. So don't think everyone who does this comes out behind in life, I actually skipped a grade. Anyway, hope you enjoyed hearing from the 0.1%. Not to say I think the way things are going in the education system less standardization is a good thing, we're all different aren't we? I did waste some time online, but I learned that didn't get me anywhere. So it taught me how to work on my own, which is a big help in college.",0.9858,267
"Okay, I have to disagree with this video. My 'personal' experience with online school has been very different. Not only have I been much happier and more productive in life, I have been getting better grades. Just about everything with my cyber school is an improvement on my local area's pubic and private schooling. I have never learned more, and in such a stable and flexible environment than at my online school. Half of these arguments boil down to if the individual student has any sense of self respect and any form of general responsibility. Really, I hate to say it, but ""grow up"". Pay attention, do your work, and apply yourself. Perhaps it's not the school, but instead many of the students. And not only that, but at my school, since it offers more flexibility at the price of *gasp* responsibility, we can choose to have multiple types to schooling. Some have no live classes, all at your own pace. Another has 1 class a week, a recap, for your on-pace learning. Another is full on live classes. And best of all, you get to customize everything; each indivual subject. Do you know what this requires? An ounce of responsibility. So, is all of this being factored in? 
And time for a cop-out; everything important in life, you have to teach yourself. You have to make decisions. Be responsible for things. I sound like a G.I. Joe PSA but it's true. I handle my entire education, and it is better this way. I have the grades to prove it. Moving along to cyber has been my greatest decision. 
Another thing; safety. Do you really want to go to brick and mortar with all of the recent events? Do you really? For what? What are you gaining at brick and mortar? 
Honeslty ask yourselves. 
Now, the numbers are the numbers. The facts are the facts. But, everything can be interpreted. Laziness, lack of responsibility, and too many general differences in my school to stack up with brick and mortar of the area. If anything, I know for sure how terrible my local schools are. Both private and public. 
I wonder if anyone will agree. The supposed 1% of you. Which is funny... Because my local ""private"" schools have been complaining about losing people to online schools lately. Funny isn't it?",0.9916,469
"On a serious note, I think that a large reason for why there's a sum of evidence pointing out how bad online charter schools are is mainly because many students abuse the online schooling system. Since no one's forcing you to study or give all your effort to assignments, the average student sees this as an opportunity to look up answers online, not actually utilize the course's content. This starts a vicious cycle in which this hypothetical student must now cheat on the next assignment, test, or quiz in order to not fail the class since they didn't actually retain any information from previous lessons. They end up BS'ing the whole course.

If you use the system diligently and give an honest effort to take notes, complete assignments without cheating, and study for tests, you'll realize quickly how the courses are on-par with traditional classes (or perhaps even ahead).",-0.5894,164

"Really love Vox content for the most part but this one is fail.
Instead of a ""shut it down"" mentality the video should have asked ""what did go wrong, what do these online schools need to to better"".
There is a good amount of studies that suggest that traditional learning isn't the be-all-end-all that the system makes it out to be. In fact the growing amounts of children in a class is a HUGE problem. On the flip side, videos that can be repeatable watched can help students that struggle with a topic and be more compressed so other students  that do understand it can move on more quickly.

The real problem is that there is very little checking if the student even learned the subject. There is very little that pushes slower pupils forward.
In contrast traditional schools are are build on the sink-or-swim mentality, which is as bad if not worse for slower students since they will fall behind in an unreachable pit for most subjects in school are based of iterative knowledge.

A really good approach to digital schools would be to have children to be exposed to knowledge in an online setting but then having physical classes which mostly serve to check if the students understood what was being taught and give very slow students an additional helping hand.",0.6572,239

Yeah but the biggest difference are in public school you're literally taught to pass the test. So while charter may look worse they're actually getting a more comprehensive education.,-0.1557,31

"if you want to improve the educational system, throw out the teacher entirely.
I go to a technical academy to learn culinary arts, and I love it but there's one thing, other than a technical or vocational school like mine I see no need for teachers at all. 

I've seen this point made by others in this comment section, that school didn't prepare them for life.

you are given a specially made state paid for tablet that is nearly indestructible.
the tablet comes with vast libraries of knowledge and a single librarian/tutor
the program can be personalized to fit your needs/desires
from the day you can read till the day you die, it can teach or tell you anything you could ever want to know.
why wouldn't we do this?",0.7469,157

k12 was great I didn't choose to drop out until after leaving the program to go to a terrible highschool; which was obviously stern against individualized learning. I decided to better myself by getting a GED and finish all my co and pre requisuits for a 2 year nursing degree. Anybody can learn it only happens when you choose to.,0.6921,64

the idea to try an get rid of online school is ridiculous public schools are absolute trash the teachers dont care and the kids are all just consuming heathens sex an partying how Instagram looks ect and with learning honestly biology an anything above 4th or 5th grade math is just completely useless you dont use it and everyone has a phone that you can just look it up instantly. get done with school an go and follow your dreams cause they are possible and are only not possible if you dont go for them.,0.0204,97

"why don't you do a video comparing public schools to private-secular schools🤔 oh wait that would show that the best option for children is something that doesn't involve the states direct influence over children's minds. I wonder why you wouldn't show those statistics as well. also for the people who say that private school is too expensive for underprivileged children, the cost per pupil per year at private school is lower than public school. which means if low income students could get scholarships or vouchers from the state, then they would be getting CHEAPER education AND a BETTER education with less STATE involvement.",0.7672,110
