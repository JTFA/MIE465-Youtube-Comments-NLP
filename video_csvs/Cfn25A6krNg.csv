*""omg there not destroying anything""*

Have you seen what mining and oil drilling operations do to the land they're on? It devastates the local ecosystem (sometimes irreparably) and completely mars the natural beauty of the land. That natural beauty is what led to the creation of the national monument in the first place. If it's a national monument, such operations can't come in and wreck it. And instead of protecting that unique and irreplaceable landscape so that future generations could appreciate it, you'd rather see it destroyed so that a dying industry could make some profit off of it for a while? 

*""it's just giving more land to get oil so we can make more money""*

Who's ""we?"" Unless you're under the impression that we're about nationalize all oil and mining companies, it's the private citizens who own those companies that are going to make the money off these lands, not us. Best case scenario (from a financial standpoint anyway) with this arrangement is that those companies pay some sort of rent to the federal government for use of the land. And knowing how congress operates, all those companies have to do is make some campaign donations, and that rent is going to be way smaller than it should be.

*""especially after Obama raised the debt from 10 to 19trillion""*

Well that's an incredibly misleading statement. While it is true that the federal debt went from around $10 trillion to around $19 trillion during Obama's two terms, it's not totally fair to say that Obama or his policies are responsible for all of that debt increase.

For one thing, Obama's first year in office was almost entirely under fiscal policy set by the previous president. Subtracting that fiscal year, and adding the 2017 fiscal year of Trump's presidency (which had it's fiscal policy set by Obama), we see that fiscal policy under Obama's leadership is only responsible for about $6.5 trillion out of that $9 trillion increase.

Furthermore, Obama is far from the only person in charge of fiscal policy, and presidents have to deal with the costs of previous president's successful policy initiatives. For Obama, that meant dealing with a reduced federal income due to the Bush tax cuts, along with the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the ever increasing costs of Social Security and Medicare due to the increasingly aging population. If we look at only federal spending increases that Obama was responsible for (meaning his administration specifically asked for increased spending on those policies, as opposed to Congress increasing spending on their own, or spending increases that are tied to previously existing laws and are not up to the discretion of politicians), that number goes from $9 trillion to about $1 trillion.

Speaking of the debt, if Trump is so concerned with increasing the debt, then why has he championed a tax bill which would add $1.5 trillion to that debt? You can't argue that this is necessary to pay off debt while the federal government is making policies that will increase the debt way more than they'd make from selling off these lands.",0.9101,589

Description:  A position will become available in November 2020 for President and Commander in Chief of a large, Federal Union of 50 individual states.
Employer:  The People of the United States of America.
Salary:  Way, WAY too little for the right candidate and way too much for the wrong one.   
Qualifications:  Must be 35 years old and a natural-born citizen of the United States
Disqualifiers:  You must not be a convicted felon, but apparently we cant exclude molesters, swindlers, perjurers, financial and sexual predators or carnival snake-oil hawkers. 
(People born in Hawaii are actually eligible, contrary to recent claims which appear to suggest Honolulu is in Kenya)

Applicants MUST MEET the following criteria for consideration:
 
Deep understanding of U.S. history, geography and political philosophy
Demonstrable understanding of the canon of economic science and ACCURATE, fact-based knowledge of contemporary and historical competing economic philosophies. 
Knowledge of world diplomatic and political history and current U.S. relationships with significant foreign powers.
Demonstrable knowledge of world geography, locations of all currently existing sovereign states and a general understanding of their current government and recent history. 
Broad knowledge of the history of humanitarian crises, global responses and non-responses and resulting outcomes.  
Knowledge of philosophy and demonstrated ability to responsibly weigh complex moral and ethical questions and identify optimal outcomes.
Understanding of global inter-connectivity of issues; ability to discuss in depth the 'knock-on' effects of policy positions both pragmatic and abstract in both the short and long term time frame.
Demonstrated long-term history accurate awareness and consistent interest in foreign and domestic policy issues.
Knowledge of U.S. Constitution, it's history and current standing of constitutional law. 
Knowledge of the U.S. governmental system, checks and balances, precedent traditions and legislative function.  Demonstrated experience in navigating the legislative process and achieving positive outcomes.
Ability to communicate clearly, expressing complex ideas with an understanding of their totality while expressing key points with clarity to an audience of mixed educational backgrounds. Demonstrated ability to understand and break down complex issues; sorting actual contributing factors from fictitious ones, identifying political camouflage and posthumous rationales and distinguishing them from constituent aspects of the issue.
Based on the preceding - demonstrable ability to identify policy tactics that may serve to impact the contributing factors within policy issues and alter the mechanisms of the issue in question to help bring about an outcome in the long term best interest of the American People.
Must have the humility to allow short term set-backs to be endured serving a long term goal - the ego must NOT get in the way of the candidate's ability to maintain focus on the needs and best interest of the American people. 
Temperament must be level, consistent and logical without being dispassionate or aloof.  You will be embroiled in events of the most stupendous gravity, and avoidance, delay, stalling, hysteria, disinterest and deflections will ALL be entirely unacceptable responses.  Often the option will exist to let events play out  and sometimes it won't.  The ideal applicant will be able to demonstrate the ability to soberly and without self-interest, evaluate such events and determine the appropriate sequence of responses, while maintaining the demeanor necessary to retain the confidence and loyalty of staff, military personnel and the American People. (No Pressure) 

All applicants are reminded that this is a service position; in it you will be a leader, but a servant first; an eternal visionary, but a daily pragmatist; a living symbol and constant ambassador for our nation and a reflection of our ideals to the world and to posterity.
The successful applicant, though elected through political process and required to act through those process must NOT set priorities based on political agendas.  The implementation of a policy for optics alone or the dismantling of a policy or, for instance, unwinding of a National Monument designation for the gratification of personal animus or as a headline-grab are not acceptable. 

You will receive generous, often quite large campaign contributions from non-human entities; foundations, corporations and professional and labor associations.  The applicant MUST be able to accept and then ignore these.  
As the successful applicant, you will NOT work for or in the disproportionate interest of any individual or group of contributors - You will be an employee and a servant of the human Persons, the Citizens of the United States.  Corporate 'persons' are not citizens and you will be as deaf as an ADDER to their cries and supplications.  
You will be tasked with the responsible stewardship of the Nation.  The People's interests, and the interests of a stable, humane global environment as conducive to the happiness and security of those People will be your sole concerns.

Interested applicants will be par-broiled and spit-roasted by antagonistic pseudo-journalists who are paid 10 times what you are by factually unhinged but popular, agenda-driven media organizations.  Mainstream media, in an attempt to avoid appearing to appreciate your capacity will focus their questions and your energy on trivial matters and tabloid fodder.  You must be prepared for statements like ""You didn't build that"" or ""If you are voting, it means you are a citizen"" to be stretched out like silly-putty, sculpted into something utterly unrecognizable, labelled as yours and then hung around your neck (figuratively) like a dead chicken.  The logic behind sound decisions will be ignored so that the same actions can be decried as illogical and tyrannical; your intentions will be skewed and misrepresented, your skills will be mocked, your shortcomings pilloried and your family treated like a punch-line pinata for 4 years, at least.  

Qualified candidates are to submit applications via Youtube video to the People of the United States starting,

Guess you think that's funny in some way?  I see how you cleverly wove that in, about the risk of getting shot by an immigrant while walking with your Dad.  That supposed to MEAN something?  You know how many people were killed by accidental shootings that year?  Of those, you know how many were killed by immigrants in San Francisco? 
Yes, that's right, ONE.  It's a special kind of stupid for so many people to jump on a bandwagon pretending that an isolated event like this is an epidemic and reason to mold national policy on immigration.    

William DeHayes had HIS gun in HIS hand when HE pulled the trigger and shot his friend's wife, killing her in front of them both.  The State of Florida, yes the same one that acquitted Zimmerman of stalking and shooting Trayvon Martin, didn't even press charges against DeHayes.  No murder, no manslaughter, no reckless endangerment, NOTHING!  Where is your outrage?  Where was your protest?  Where are your stupid jokes about the dangers of rotund white guys in Florida?   

Never heard of DeHayes, have you?  You haven't heard of him because the President didn't mention his victim, Sean Hannity never commented on the shooting and the army of rudderless drones following them never picked up the script and repeated their lines in the pantomime of outrage that played out all over the country.  These things did not happen because there was no political payoff to exploiting DeHayes's victim as there was with Steinle.  There was no payoff, because DeHayes was not Hispanic, he was not an immigrant and he was not illegal.  He was a good-ole, beer swilling, MAGA hat-wearing white guy.

So, while Steinle's death triggers a national lynch-mob demanding an absurd wall to stop a one in a billion event from happening again, DeHayes' victim is forgotten and no action of any kind is taken, to do anything.",-0.9899,358

Can that state determine what happens on that land, how it is used and how it is not used, because it is within their boundaries?  Does New Mexico have a right to expect a 'return of control' of that land in the way you pine for Utah 'regaining control' over land that was never theirs to control?

They would have to sell it before it would transfer to private ownership/ State control.,0.0,72

"The Bears Ears National Monument was so designated by president Obama in December of 2016 after a request from Five Native American Tribes who had been pushing for the designation for years.

Over 100,000 Native American Artifacts are there, which include burial grounds.  The Native Americans consider this land a sacred place where they go to become one with their Ancestors.  What Trump did is no different than someone going into your church and destroying 85% of it.  To make matters worse, even though the Native Americans fought for the designation, the Trump Administration did not even have the decency to consult with these same Native Americans on this issue.  Trump talks about a land grab.  He must be talking about his hero Andrew Jackson who forced Native Americans off their land in the Southeast and marched them to an area West of the Mississippi.  Perhaps that is who he is trying to emulate with this action.
