"Detail that I found interesting in the young mans facial features was he had wrinkles on his cheek when smiling.. Perhaps that is due to him wearing braces. When I was young I was fortunate enough to avoid the braces thing. Or maybe he was burned on the face and had a skin graft at one time.. But looked odd, a 13 year old with wrinkles when he smiles.",0.6369,75
