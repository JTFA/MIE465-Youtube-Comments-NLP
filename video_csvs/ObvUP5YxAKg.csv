Plus most of the teachers at public schools don't know what the fuck they are teaching. They just go off the book and hand out papers. School is no longer about learning, it's about passing.

Guns need to be licensed and gun owners should be aware of where their guns are at all times.  Drivers and cars are just a few things we license in these states and those things aren‚Äôt meant to kill people. It is time to start licensing guns and when it‚Äôs time to sell your gun let‚Äôs do that at a gun consignment store where everyone has to pass rigorous background tests and the ownership is transferred. Also, If you‚Äôre found in position of a gun that is not licensed to you well you go to jail for a very long time. The cost for these services would be covered by the licensing fee. Finally automatic or semi automatic weaponry should be illegal. Bump stocks and the elk should not be sold to the general public. I understand that some gun owners feel the need to have Assault rifles just in case or because you can‚Äôt. I believe that there should be exclusions for some gun owners who can pass rigorous testing or those who have joined a militia.",-0.9918,243

Instead of teaching ur child he can be a little girl or little girl can be a boy just for u to look tolerant ur sacrificing ur children. Liberals should not be aloud to have children.

"People that try to suicide often try again in ~3 months, and often repeatedly. One thing that guns do is make suicide 140x more deadly than any other method, there is no opportunity to try again. We have 20,000+ suicides every year, and 15,000+ gun deaths in 2015/2016 . Japan with 1/3rd our population had 13 gun deaths, total, about 1 in 10,000,000, whereas for us it's 1 in 21,6000. Though they also have a suicide problem of 26 per 100,000 due to all methods, ours is 13.6 per 100,000. So we have roughtly 44,000 suicides annually and 50% are from firearms. 

While women attempt suicide 2x more often than men, men die by suicide 3.5x more often than women, probably in large part to easy access of guns, and harder access to mental healthcare. Our problem as a nation could be solved by both while reducing access to firearms for people suffering, as well as something like Medicare for all single payer so these issues don't compound and we have a healthier nation both physically and mentally.

And now that the person commited suicide everyone is like awwww. Yes I don't know what they are thinking but neither do you so we can speculate.,-0.8655,126
