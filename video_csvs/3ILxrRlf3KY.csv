"America has become a society of mindless sheep. Instead of paying attention to the things that matter, like the fact that millions of our people are in prison for non-violent drug offenses and the IRS stealing our money every year and calling it ""taxes,"" people focus on the hottest new rap songs, Kylie Jenner having a baby, and the Eagles winning the Super Bowl. Society needs to wake up and smell the roses. We can distract ourselves with social media and mindless entertainment, but it doesn't change the fact that we're all getting fucked over by the corrupt people we put in office. It's time for a revolution. The Founding Fathers told us that if the US government ever became to us what Great Britain was to them, the American people had a right and duty to overthrow and replace their government with something new. We're long over due for that change. It's time for a revolution. If all of the 700K people who viewed this video marched on Washington and demanded change, we'd get it. Stop sleeping and wake up.",-0.7906,200
