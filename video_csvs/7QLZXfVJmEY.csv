"I sprinkle flux (90% borax + 5% quartz sand + 5% charcoal powder) this is necessary for forging (forge) welding. The flux is alloyed with scale - the formed substance is sufficiently fluid and is easily displaced by deformation. In addition, the flux protects against oxygen and charcoal, carburizes the surface layer of metal - which lowers the welding temperature (if in brief).",0.4939,77
