@ijustine easy trick with Face ID is to blink it unlocks much faster even with the extra security on. Also the mirror thing is a pretty big deal when it comes to security. What I’m curious about it if you take a picture of the reflection print it in high quality and try it that way ? If not the cut eye holes and have someone position their eyes behind it.,0.9155,76

"iJustine The iPhone X's OLED Screen is made by Samsung but is around 1080p (as we know Apples Retina Displays is never the common resolution!) that is much less than the Galaxys 2K also the iPhones X's screen is less than half as bright as the Galaxy 8 & 8+ net alone the Note, also Not 18 to 9 ratio (aka 2 to 1!).

iOS has never had true widgets that you can place on whatever page you want and unlike Android Widgets can not resize and/or reshape them!

Apple stole the Control Center from Android and over time has made it more and more like Android (FIRST locked icons, then later you could add a remove icons and now with the X you even have to pull down from the top to get to it like on Android!) but yet Apple still can not or will not add an Apps Folder (even if it was set to off by defualt many many iOS users would like that option as Apple is meant to be about the clean asthetic and having 6 pages of apps by fefualt does not do that and also hides wall papers by defualt!) also the iOS version on the X has a much slower and convaluted way of accessing Home, Recent Apps excetra then even their old home button net alone Androids easy and more natural three button set up (Seriously Apple no onscreen Home Button even if it was invisible in certain apps/settings/landscape Samsung did that and it works very well! The Top Notch is wasted space as too much is crammed into to little space and why could Apple not merge Notifications and Quick Settings like Android and allow users to just pull down on one side of the notch to access all the functions (Notification & Quick Settings!) to make it easier on people with small hands and people that are left handed?

The New Camera angle while ok just still does not look as good as the older iPhone 7 Plus set up also why does the Camera Hump have to be so big surely Apple could shrink it down like Oppo managed to do or make the phone made thicker heaven forbid to allow for a bigger to aloow for a bigger battery and thus much longer battery life (Yes I do know they use two batterys in an L shape giving it better life thanks to a stcked Logic/Mother Board but that just ads to my argument of making the back thicked not thinner!) and help flatten out the camera bump as a result!

Face ID has been hacked yes it is a nice idea like Samsungs Iris Scanner but use it in addtion to Touch ID which many people would still have loved to see either in the screen (Many people belive that Apple got it working but dropped it due to cost and having to remove the haptic engine!) or maybe put it in the Apple Logo on the back that makes sense right?! (BTW this again adds to my argument of a slightly thicker device!) Or maybe due a Sony and put the Touch ID in the side mounted power button!

Still no unlocked NFC to allow people to transfer files fast and easy, This is nothing to do with security as Apple Claims (As Blutooth and WiFi are much much bigger threats and Apple still includes them without locking them!) but to Force Banks to use their Apple Pay so they can take a chunck of the profit while with Android you can use a banks defualt apps to pay or use Android Pay or even Samsung Pay if you have a Sammy device, Apple locking NFC only to payments and only on Apple Pay is Anti-Competitive under Australian/New Zealand and I belive US Law to name just two/three!

Still no option to change icons or ability to add luanchers to customize ones personal device!

Still no option to set defualt apps you are forced to use Apple's Apps!

No Battery Percentage display opton now even in Control Center?!",0.9919,743
