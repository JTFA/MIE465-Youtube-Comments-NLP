They gave Jim all those pranks but they forgot to give us a reason to hate Dwight, so all this just completely misses the point. I remember how satisfied I was when Jim pranked Andy and ultimately caused him to be sent to anger management, cause it was WELL DESERVED. Dwight does not really deserve any of this.
