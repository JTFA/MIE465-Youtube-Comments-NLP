"HugeD4nKGum 6 hours of sleep per day isn't bad so to say but I'd recommend trying to get up to the 8-9 hour mark until you're 18-19. It'll help you develop both mentally and physically until you are a ""young adult"" otherwise you could have issues with brain development or other things. This video is geared more towards people in their mid 20's to 30's but if you can get around 8-9 hours of sleep till you hit 20 you'll start to understand why it is so important, otherwise you might look back and regret your sleep related decisions. 

Best of luck!

I have been plagued with a lifetime of chronic insomnia. Nothing is worse than seeing the sun come up on the second day without a second of sleep except when the third day comes. I have been on every sleeping medication out there. After 2 or 3 days It doesn't work I stay awake straight through the meds. Going without sleep makes me feel like I have the flu. And eventually my mind and body crashes. I don't see too much of the 3rd day of sunrises like I used to but at 45 seeing 2 is exhausting enough. In the marines they told us we only need 4 hours max. But I think it was moreso to remain acute and aware to have another's life in your hands as they slept and vice-versa. If I could do what this video claims I would be ecstatic and much more rested and productive. Because whether you sleep 12 hours a day or zero hours for 2 or more days it all leads to no productivity. Sleep is important and why some of us struggle for some sort of sleep schedule and can't obtain it is very frustrating and exhausting. And I've tried everything. And literally my body is so exhausted but my brain won't shut down even though it's extremely fatigued.,-0.9565,234

Also this is not for snoozers. This kind of sleep schedule is for morning people‚Äîthe kind of people who wake up with a bounce, instead of needing that hot coffee and cold shower to get things rolling. I know a lot of people who get more tired when they wake up from naps (yes, even 25 minute ones), or have trouble falling asleep during the day. 

Lastly, you obviously will need to have a flexible schedule rather than a rigid one when you‚Äôre working hard all day. I think he puts it best: if your life is more like an endless ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list, this can be for you. ...and you‚Äôre a morning person. ;)  

But even with all that aside, as someone who this has worked perfectly for, I still would not generally recommend this as a healthier alternative for someone‚Äôs sleep pattern. If you‚Äôre hopelessly busy, like I was throughout med school, then try it to help you survive. But it‚Äôs not worth it as a lifestyle or long-term thing. The social sacrifices involved, the kinds of things you miss out on, and a more strained ability to plan things is just not worth it in the end for someone‚Äôs long term mental health.",0.6863,306

I have a weird sleep pattern, my friends call me ""the Count""! lol, was sick about 5 years ago with mono or something just as exhausting with fevers for 4 months, was terrible, Doctors couldn't figure it out, anyways, was sleeping sooo much about 12-14hrs a day.. and I couldn't sleep with a fever so was up all night and when fever broke around 5 am +, I would then goto sleep, that way wouldn't have to wake up and clean myself up and new sheets everynight.. so fast forward, I now goto bed around 6am and wake up around 2pm or later sometimes.. my family is finally used to it, it feels normal to me..",-0.4199,152
