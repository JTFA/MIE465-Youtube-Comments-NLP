"+Cameron Homan yeah, right.  Because anyone on this planet other than a leftist is advocating for a gun ban in America.

You aren’t presenting arguments, you’re presenting narratives.  “Because psychology says so” isn’t an argument.  

The most violent places in this country are those cities with the strictest gun control, chicago being right at the top of that list.",-0.9299,76
"+Cameron Homan you don’t seem to understand how an all out gun ban, i.e. repealing the second amendment (because repealing the second is the ONLY way such a thing could work) would have to go.  First of all, new evidence (not just that presented in 2008) that objectively proves that the decision the supreme court arrived at in heller was wrong would have to be presented, and this doesn’t exist.  Then the supreme court would have to overturn heller.  Then 2/3 of congress would have to agree to put up to a vote to repeal the second amendment.  It’s the next closest thing to a guarantee that this will never happen.  Then...3/4 of the states would have to repeal it.  One state=one vote on this matter.  Each state has equal say.  Not in this lifetime nor in any other is that going to happen.",0.4069,174
"+Cameron Homan you’re not even fooling yourself with that drivel.  What you just wrote isn’t worth a $3 bill.  Your self-placating platitudes are not of interest to me.  “Not wishing to waste the time with your citations,” means you cede the argument.  No one is going to just take it on the “authority” of your word that what you’re saying is valid.

You have not presented an argument, you cannot present one, and you cannot defend your position on a gun ban.

John LeBaron one more thing about your American responsibility and the whole car debate. Owning these types of weapons is a responsibility but just like if you constantly get DWIs or DUIs what ends up happening? You're car gets taken away and your license gets suspended indefinitely in most cases. Do you know why?.... because of the lack of responsibly.  You can't be trusted with a vehicle.  America has been irresponsible to many times and you can't be trusted anymore. The next step is to take those weapons away. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. The gun control policies in place now didn't work after the first mass shooting or the second or the third or the last. What makes you think continuing this way is going to work this time?

You're right though I remember when a couple of kids used sugar to kill 12 and injure 21 other kids in Columbine..... Oh wait... that's not right.... it was one kid recently at a school in Florida. My mistake. 

The point is when people die in cars its usually called an accident. I can't even remember the lay time someone got in a car in this country and said ""I'm going to run over and kill 20 people today"". As far as sugar goes... Lol... sorry but that's a really funny argument... anyway.... you're doing that to yourself. If you want to go and buy a shotgun to blow your own head off.... by all means, feel free. 

And don't forget, the argument isn't to ban all guns. That's ridiculous.  Its to ban the ones that make it easy to commit mass murder. 

 like I said before stop being cowards. If you want to own and shoot these weapons join the military. Go kill each other over seas to protect your government's pockets.

"Juju jujuria what do kids have anything to do with it? The fact that a crazy (obviously mentally disturbed) kid just so happen to get his hands on guns; instead of bombs, knives, or any other type of weapon, has nothing to do with the fact that rich people will buy others off to promote their agendas. (Might I add more people own guns, than their are mass shootings, so to blame the guns is just idiotic... it’s like blaming cars for road deaths or blaming a fork if you get fat).
Anyways...Primarily, their are rich a-holes out there who want to stay rich. They believe guns in the hands of normal citizens is bad because they could start an uprising to overthrow/ take them out. So they are going to try every manipulation tactic to try to take guns away. Then slowly anything else that can be used as a weapon. So they use these shootings as a means to stir up fear, confusion and division in hopes to gain control over the masses. Where were they in the 80’s and 90s with gang violence? There was no “black lives matter” or “gun control” talk then. That’s because it wasn’t on the agenda of the rich elite, back then it was all about throwing them in jail or  taking them out ... then if you look back, Clinton was talking about border control and needing better ways to keep illegals out, but that is tucked away and forgotten. Why? Again, the people with the money control what gets put out their and if that is put on blast, it will ruin part of their fight against Trump.

"Listen I don’t care about the right or left but I do care about wether or not children are being murdered. With that being said, you republicans haven’t had 1 good excuse to not ban semi-auto rifles. The biggest excuse you have is that people who want to commit these crimes will get the illegally...... how ignorant can you possibly be. Anyone can do anything illegally so your answer is we should just make it legal? That’s how you plan on saving lives?! How stupid are you? Before you answer that and realize that it is very stupid, can you just give me all your money and sign the title to your car over to me so I don’t have to steal it illegally? Thx. Oh and btw I’m sure there some people that would like to rape your children and since you can probably get child slaves in the black market for the right price you might as well let them just buy your kids instead. We wouldn’t want to make things to hard for these psychopaths..... you people on the left can be pretty dumb sometimes but, holy shit righties! You really have outdone yourselves this time.

Also.... the other argument of, if the “good” people with mass murdering weapons can’t get them legally then how will they ever stop the bad people who are getting them illegally? Ask yourself this... where the hell have you been?! you so called “good” people with these weapons have always had them yet this continues to happen! When are you planning on stopping them? After all the children are dead? All I see are cowards who like big guns to put in a display case. And don’t kid yourselves, even if you had the balls to approach an active shooter 90% of you who own an assault rifle wouldn’t even begin to understand how to shoot it properly.

You’re mad because someone wants to stop selling you your toys and you don’t want to admit that it’s the right thing to do yet in the meantime what you are admitting to is that your hobby is more important than the lives of the people you supposedly love.

"Weirdette You actually sound earnest.

So, There are millions upon millions of so-called assault rifles in the hands of Americans. If the assault rifle was even close to being the cause, there would easily be 100 shootings a day.

This is no different than blaming cars for the millions of deaths in car accidents. Shoot, let’s ban cars?

We could translate this to people that are obese, Let’s ban sugar?

I could go on and on about all the evils that occur as a result of people that use a “tool” of some kind. 

If it were truly possible to remove the so called assault rifles from the hands of the American citizens, the mentally delusional the criminals etc. would still have weapons that could commit mass shootings.

All of these perpetrators have been either on psychiatric drugs or were recently on psychiatric drugs.  This is the common denominator that the media and Government will not tell you.

There is an enormous amount of folly in comparing abortion to gun control. I'm on the fence with gun control because I firmly believe that banning assault weapons will only send them underground, which means that the radar our authorities rely on to intervene in what would be mass shootings will disappear. Without that radar, we might have an actual increase in attacks. I don't know. Still, other than that, I haven't heard very good reasoning from either side.

But I'll jump at any argument from gun-toters to keep their guns based on the fact that liberals tend to support abortion rights, then minimize the argument with the simplistic reasoning that both result in death.",-0.9675,128
