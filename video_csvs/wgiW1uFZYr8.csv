EDIT: As I mentioned in the video, I've built this list with the job market and ease of learning as my main criteria. That's why I decided to put, for example, Ruby instead of PHP in my list (Ruby has a really nice, simple syntax).

If I were to add two more languages to this list, I think they would be PHP and C#-- they would also be great languages to learn considering the current job market. I'm personally not too experienced with their syntax though-- would be great if I could get some comments about how they are from you guys.

But

I haven't got a clue about computer programming at all

The best computer programmers in the world must be looking for ideas or projects to develop etc

I have the ideas but without a the tech skills to develop any of the ideas I have although I have the dot com domains of all my ideas bought for reg fee etc

What I could achieve if with a good Web developer would be significant

I don't want to learn programming I am happy in my field eg finding concepts and buying the dot com domains of the concepts etc

And would want a developer to do what they do eg write code and develop my ideas etc

Also, should you choose to switch to a different programming language to hone your coding skills, it will become relatively much easier if you started with C++ as a first language.
