Like the greens, reds, and/or blues are just slightly off from the main linework/imagery. (Just using red and blue is the most popular, and it's usually just that the dark tones have a slight red shadow on one side, and blue on the other.) This is usually used for dark subject matter, because the piece itself often ends up having high contrasted imagery. This is often evoking the aesthetic of old worn out recordings, especially tv broadcasts.

I just find that interesting that even in our modern age where clean and accurate colouring is extremely simple and easy, people just _like_ the aesthetic so much that they purposefully go out of their way to make their work look like that.
