Hahahaha so hugs CAN be sexual abuse! Satire my arse. So you have to time hugs now? Let's not focus on thr rapes and assualt! People who class bs as abuse are shitting all over abused victims. Yes there are degrees of abuse but the degree doesn't start at 'a long hug'. Plus what if your crush (or some woman with a very low cut shirt showing off her tits) hugs you? God forbid you get an erection even if you stop hugging her and flee in embarrassment guess what? You're a horrible scumbag who deserves nothing but scorn!

Your inability to read shows in the fact that you couldn't get that I'm a guy (who don't generally wear makeup) not to mention further proving your sexism since you think the only possible reason that women wear it is for other guys. It must be hard for you to understand that some do it because its fun and creative or because they want to look good for themselves (can you believe it girls have self-esteem too). Also, you have seemed to missed the whole point that I acknowledge that people have a different take on what it is (one side) and that the law has another take (second side). The main point was that the law, company rules don't care if you act within your own understanding but break them (the red light example). Another example of your inability to read is that in my last reply made it very clear that the whole point of the flat Earth was an example to show that just because someone has an opinion doesn't make them inherently right.

Heterosexual relationships are filth, and heterosexual people are subhuman morons.

Studies have shown that it's more about the person committing it feeling powerful than for the sex. I've been sexually attracted to a lot of people and I have yet to sexually harassed or assault anyone.

As you pointed out (which I agreed with) is that people do have a subjective understanding what isn't or is sexual harassment etc, this is the issue, not the law or can you not read. The problem with that has to do that people can both hold personal subjective beliefs and be objectively wrong (hence the flat Earth example).

"This is s**t - 40% of young women apparently think winking at a woman is sexual harassment - and why would a man risk his career if a woman decides to make a complaint?
A female colleague suddenly gave me a stare of ice when we were joking and laughing and I touched her arm lightly for under half a second. I will never do that again or do anything except talk strictly about work with her.
On the other hand a woman in the office who clearly wanted to go out with me literally ran her hands all over the lower part of my body - I didn't react because I wasn't interested and tried to play it down by ignoring it (no, I wasn't traumatised :-)  ), however, she got very angry when I didn't respond and afterwards I noticed a couple of her friends shunned me in the office !  Fortunately for me she didn't make a malicious complaint but I now wonder what would have happened if she had done so.
The sensible response for men to all of this stuff is to try and avoid women at work as much as possible, some of them are very unpredictable and seem to feel they have the right to be completely unaccountable for their actions.",-0.5873,232

"This show is just embarrassingly unfunny. I assume this was the BBC's attempt at re-creating The Daily Show with Jon Stewart/Trevor Noah and replacing the material with Brexit, UKIP, PC, etc. with obvious mentions of Trump and other US current affairs. Of all the satirical political comedy programmes I've watched, this is possibly one of the worst, if not *THE worst* I've ever seen (and this is coming from someone who used to watch Russel Howard's Good News years ago), it is simply unfunny to the core.

The jokes don't land and feel rather forced. The host sounds obnoxious to listen to, as if he's desperately trying to impersonate John Oliver (The Daily Show alumni). And I am aware that the material is one-sided in the political spectrum, I personally prefer to stay neutral in current affairs as it is difficult to find middle ground nowadays.

This show is simply not that funny as they make it out to be, I understand there is an audience who may enjoy this humour and that's fine let them be. But the programme's material doesn't genuinely humour me and I highly doubt it ever will.",-0.5344,218
