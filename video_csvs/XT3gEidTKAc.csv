"I know this comment probably wont be seen. But, I'd like one more version of the song to be released. One, final, master version of the song. Where it it acoustic still (the better sounding one), but we get to have Steven and James do the second verse. Keep the entire second verse of the non-acoustic version (Steven singing/James rapping), but keep Cib on the first verse and the Sunday Funday part. It would be the perfect mix of both<3",0.8294,97
"I like this version a lot better than the original. The original, if I'm being frank, was just too silly sounding for me. I loved it, but I would not have called it a good song. This however, I think is better mixed, orchestrated, and even tonally sounds better, like a really good song. This is a compliment to you guys, btw! Good job!",0.988,78
