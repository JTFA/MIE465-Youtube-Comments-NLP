And thank you for proving how triggered y'all are. You are a prime example. First of all, this is YouTube, and who are you?üòÇ I don't owe you or anyone else perfect punctuation. Also I speak five languages. 4 Fluently, so punctuation isn't really on my mind. And you said you've been around the USA. You don't live here, you can't speak on our diversity like your an American. And America is technically more diverse then India....we may have the same underlying culture but that's with ANY country including India. In America we have southern culture, northern culture, Eastern and western culture. And it gets more complex then that. We have hundreds of languages also, and culture is also different according to race. I grew up in a upper class, Latino, East Asian, black and Polynesian cultures and they all were different and all American. Nothing against y'all, or your diversity or accents but your being hostile and rude for no reason and it's really odd to me.",-0.867,199

I grew up in the U.S, so yes, I am very much a good source of information for how ""diverse"" is the U. S or India. If anything, my argument holds more weight simply because I've lived in different parts of both countries and experienced the various cultures and languages. I have no particular bias towards either country because my mom is American and my dad is Indian+Swedish. I'm talking about diversity in terms of each state having it's own history due to the different languages spoken, cuisines, way of dressing, culture, ethnicities, etc. And politically speaking, they're all represented equally in India. So, it is a very different scenario. Lastly, I'm sure you save your perfect punctuation and grammar for ""special occasions"". Lol. What a joke. I'm also sure you grew up in ""a"" upper class.

"lol im Indian and I find these people awful, and the guy who said South Indians are more educated than North, do u ever travel outside..oh what travel, lets say have u ever walked beyond your street is my question, and the way u address yourself ""I myself from South India"" lol! Thats a 
""wery wery vell"" answer. North-east India has the highest literacy rate in India and we don't quite look like any other Indians(I mean we have different skin tone, accent, looks, and everything) and because of this they'll ask if we are from China/Korea/Japan etc. everytime they came across north-east Indians and they'll call us chinkies which is a word used to look down on us like calling black people nigger. That's how racist Indians are and how illiterate they are. I remember so many guys coming up to me until now asking me where i came from, and my answers would be like ""Im Indian and im from Mizoram, and they'd reply asking me which country is Mizoram in and vice versa. 'country' btw lol). They don't even know which states are in India. Forget about the accent, 70-80% don't know how to speak english. To the guy who said everything is taught in English, you are one extra smartass; North-east states are the only states you can call ""states teaching in English"" because they do, they would punish us if we speak one word in any other language other than English when i was in school i,e from my 1st day of school till i finished my 12, besides N-E maybe in some parts of Delhi/Bangalore/Mumbai they teach in English and some parts of South India. I remember the 1st college i joined, they explained everything in Hindi and because of that  most of us had to leave the college because they wont explain it in English, and even the teacher themselves don't know proper English; i know some guys will be like ""they teach everything in Hindi and how is that bad"", imagine you're in a college and the whole lecture is in Hindi, even mathematics lol! And the 2nd college i joined was one of the best college in India (I wont say the name)because i got 3rd position in my state on my AIEEE exam and through that i got admission to the college, and what happened in that college was, i remember my English teacher giving us an example of a ""noun"" from the sentence,""An Aeroplane is taking off from the ground"", she explains that ""taking -off"" is the noun lmao rofl, one of the best college in India btw. Around 95% of my classmates were with her. Me and my friends from Delhi, Bangalore, Assam and Nagaland were the only one who stood with the correct answer. She corrected her mistake the next day btw lol. Forget about the Mother Tongue thing, everyone has their Mother Tongue and it's never gonna disappear as long as you're extra dumb to forget your own mother tongue; English is an International language and you're suppose to know and learn English and the teachers are suppose to teach in English unless it's a very low budget school/college as an exceptional case.I was so annoyed and thus Im sharing my huge opinion; Interviewing kids like these will get lots of dislike obviously because they don't talk facts, they lie to act smart. It is a fact that you can't have the proper English accent unless you're born with it or practice it, but being a Student or an educated person speaking in a thick funny ass accent with huge broken English is just plain wrong, and we are living in 2018, step up and learn. To conclude, lemme ask, ""Ever wonder why Billionaires/millionaires/famous people etc. who started out with broken English always  end up learning proper English after they became successful!"".",-0.9419,751
