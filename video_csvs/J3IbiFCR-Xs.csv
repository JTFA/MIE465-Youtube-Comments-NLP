It began with the suspensions: two games were taken in 2013; substance-abuse, naivete, and a man's simple desire to get high. Ten were taken in 2014; poor judgement from a great receiver of countless footballs. And forty-four, forty-four games were taken between 2015 and 2017 from the race of fantasy footballers, who, above all else, desire points. For within these suspensions was bound the strength and will to govern the outcome of fantasy football leagues. But they were all of them deceived, for a brief reprieve was made: in the year of 2013, in the fires of FirstEnergy Stadium, the Dank lord Gordon forged, in public, a masterful fourteen games to be remembered before all others. And into these games he poured his speed, his routes, and his will to dominate all secondaries.

One receiver to Rule them All.",0.8248,206
