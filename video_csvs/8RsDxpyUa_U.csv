"Considering the fact that currency values differ between countries and regions, this experiment doesn't really translate well into actual description of hardships. $2.50 a day in /US of America/ is difficult. But consider the value of $2.50 in another country that might consider the US dollar is greater or less than what we value it as. The dynamic changes drastically. In a region where $1 is much more valuable makes it much easier to live on that $2.50, while $1 valued less makes it harder.

"Sadly that's why people struggle with obesity in a lot of the North American areas. I think Ramen packs are actually considered 2 servings and the amount of sodium is terrible... I got specialty Ramen noodles from the Asian section of the grocery store and they have like 260 calories and like 1025 mg of sodium.... and that's for 1/2 a serving... cause who doesn't eat only half a pack of Ramen rofl. But yeah... because people struggle with trying to get by one a food budget and bills/rent/etc. It's super expensive these days. And they give you larger quantities for the unhealthy foods, making it seem like a bargain.

But yeah compare how much it costs for healthy choices vs most processed and fast foods... it's depressing. Plus because so many people ""don't have the time"" to cook or eat at home because of busy schedules and working, etc. People tend to not eat as many healthy foods like fresh fruits, veggies, meats, grains, etc. Instead they have to resort to packaged, canned and processed foods or take out.  I remember when buying veggies was like super affordable. But now it costs so much to just get some peppers, tomatoes, etc. And those things require a planned cooking routine since you don't want them to go bad.... and you have to buy per week mostly and not monthly so that's more time you have to invest in cooking/shopping. 

Poverty leads to unhealthy eating habits, which leads to poor health and mental/emotional issues.
