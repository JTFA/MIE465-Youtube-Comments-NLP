"18 hours is a long time?! That's less than a day Jenny, they had to go to Canto Bight, get caught, escape and rampage, not to mention sneak onto the Supremacy and find the tracker in that time. I know Star War's hyperspace is fast, but eighteen hours is time enough for drama without being so small the fleet's blown up by the time Finn and co return. 
Considering Kylo's temper they might've died far from battle. Also I think they're saving them for the third movie. 
Yah I think burning the jedi texts was a bit gratuitous. Come on you have to be able to learn something from them. Don't just throw away all that history! 
Yah I liked Kylo killing Snoke really made an intense scene all the more involving. Plus Snoke just seemed to be a Darth Sideous stand in. 
Stop that! No more shirtless Kylo Ren for you! 
Honestly I'd like it if Rey's parents were not uber important, because it would show that force users are not just all one big messed up family. And what you said. 
""The First Order is being run by bickering children."" I think it could get old really quickly. I mean how can Kylo and Hux rule a galaxy (now that the New Republic has been destroyed nearly offscreen). They need to show planning and cunning, which I don't think two bickering children would have.

Disney is pressuring the bigger YT channels into reviewing this mess of a flic hilariously positively. Those who are too critical about TLJ are threatened to lose their VIP status in the whole SW franchise machinery. And I am compassionate about their dilemma.
I mean to each its own and everybody is free to have his/her own taste but this wide rating margin between critics and audience is no mere coincidence. It's as sad as to watch Mark Hamill being forced to retract his negative statements about his character Luke and the movie.

How has the First Order taken control of the galaxy when last we saw them they were on the ropes have lost Star Killer Base?

Who are the Knights of Ren? They won't even address it.

Who are Rey's parents? Oh nobody? So she is just super powerful and equivalent to the the Skywalker bloodline? The strongest force users? That makes no sense.

Why did Admiral Holdo not tell her direct subordinate Poe her plan? You know, like a real military commander. No apparent reason other than to set up the complete pointless Finn side quest. 

Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself to stop the First Order and save the rebels. An action that is in sharp contradiction to what her sister did at the beginning of the movie. 

Captain Phasma wasted again.

How can Rey swim when she's lived on a desert planet all her life?

And How is Rey the combat equivalent to Kylo already? When she's sustained exactly zero training with a light saber. She just good at it, just because?! That made no sense. 

Luke, the ultimate optimist who saw light in the darkest man in the galaxy and turned him to the light. He has a knee jerk reaction to kill someone for, having dark thoughts. Something Luke would never do to a random child, much less his nephew.

And Luke dies because... plot, I guess. And don't tell me producing a force projection was too strenuous for him cause Kylo and Rey both do it and there is nothing to suggest it we can do them or effected them in anyway.

This whole movie seemed like all it wanted was to marginalize and push out all the things we loved from the old trilogy in favor of Disney's new creations. ""Let the Past die. Kill it, if you have to."" Seemed like Disney was talk to the fans about the original trilogy.

All I wanted was to see Luke be a Jedi Master badass. ""John Wick with a light saber"" as someone else aptly purposed. And for Luke not to die, but if he had to at least make it a death he deserved. Not fading away because Disney is done with him.

All in all Last Jedi was a story badly told. And honestly I'm not even interested in what happens in the story now. I suppose It's possible episode IX could be good but it has serious damage control to do and I sincerely doubt it will. This movie just had no respect for what we all loved about the originals. 

I could have written a better story for this movie, and that is not saying much at all.

I don't think all characters were emotionally investing, like Rose and the whole RosexFinn pairing.
Other things you forgot to mention: How pointless the Canto Bight-plot is because appearantly you can just ignore the tracking by fleeing in smaller transport ships... and then the lightning from Yoda. I mean, why doesn't Yoda kill all the bad guys now?
And I really don't understand why Luke had to die that way. 
And I do agree with it being interesting with Rey not having any special parents, but Snoke was way too powerful to not be given some sort of special background.
This movie pretty much killed all my interest in going to see the last one... which is bad.

"I love your channel!  One comment you made got me thinking though..  Just because some one disliked The Last Jedi and loved Rogue One does not mean they are some fanboy who doesn't care about character development and only needs some awesome Darth Vader and cool Star Warsey action. (Maybe you weren't implying that, but that's how I read it...)  I disliked the Last Jedi and not for any of the reasons mentioned in your 10 worst reasons vid.  I didn't mind Rey's parents reveal, Snoke's role, Kylo as a villain, Luke's situation, the broom kid, etc.. in fact I loved most of those scenes!!  I just thought it was a bad movie because of the constant ""shock"" scenes, lack of flow, inconsistency, a feeling of disconnection from the previous film, and too many cringe-worthy scenes (Rose ""We save the ones we love..."").  As for Rogue One, I know the characters may have not been developed to a standard that would be taught in film class, but in this particular film it didn't bother me too much - I don't consciously watch to see if there are character arcs... I liked most of the characters and the way they died may have not been emotionally resounding but in that way it was like real war - it felt more gritty and less produced which is an accomplishment for Disney.  Overall, it was a fun ride and felt like the Star Wars universe...it's not perfect but I definitely prefer it over TLJ.  As for Vader, I didn't need to have him there, but due to the fact that the film took place just before Episode IV with the Death Star being a main setting, I don't see how you could not put him in the film... that would actually be strange.. you have James Earl Jones around to do the voice and you make a film in a time and setting where Vader would be and just not use him?  He was one of the main authority figures on the Death Star.  I don't get why you don't like Vader in Rogue One.. and I HATE when characters are shoved in our face just for fan service (my 10 worst SW moments video include ALL those scenes from the prequels).  Having said that, Vader was not the end all be all, and without him in it, I would still like the film.

"I'm puzzled by all the people who claim to be intense lovers of the OT that are now raging about Luke's character in TLJ.  I mean they must not have watched Empire or Return of the Jedi with any shred of critical thought, otherwise they'd already know that the entire last act of Empire and the first act of ROTJ consists of Luke doing some seriously questionable shit that a true paragon of Jedi values would find misguided at best and reprehensible at worst.  Even in his final battle against Vader, he becomes enraged and uses that as fuel to defeat his own father and IT WORKED so well that he came dangerously close to actually murdering him - despite it being his intention when going in to that confrontation to try to save him.  And prior to that when the Emperor tried to goad him ala ""strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey toward the Dark Side will be complete"" and then he tried to do fucking EXACTLY THAT only seconds later...

Where the fuck are people getting this understanding of Luke Skywalker as someone too good and pure to suffer from temptation or even actively make shady choices in order to accomplish what he thinks is right?  I mean unless they're relying solely on how Luke was portrayed in the EU, which means fuck all canonically and doesn't apply in the slightest to these films, they're just spouting bullshit with no legitimate basis in the story of the OT and Luke's characterization in it.

"The fact that Rey is so powerful and knows how to do basically everything and wins in fucking every fight she's in without having any training pissed me off in the first film, it's even worse in this film.

The forced, cheesy humor in this was really bad. 

The Asian girl and every storyline she was in should have been cut entirely from this film. Finn should have been doing any side quest that he potentially went on with Poe instead: It would have developed both of their characters more and would have been so much better.

The Monte Carlo planet was fucking terrible and has no place in the Star Wars universe. That plotline should have been cut entirely.

The fact that Laura Dern wouldn't tell Poe that there was a legit plan even after he had mutinied and detained her, is fucking retarded and the most unforgivable plot hole of all the Star Wars films. 

Why did they wait so long to light speed ram a ship into Snoke's ship? Why not have that be plan A and then everyone survives and gets away? And why has nobody ever done that in the past? Why did they not just do that to either of the three death stars (yes, Starkiller base is a fucking Death Star), the droid control ships, or any other large ship that they have encountered in the previous movies?

Brienne of Tarthe was wasted yet again.

How they wrote Luke was disappointing. Mark Hamill is right.

The cutesy, kid friendly bullshit is always annoying in these movies, but at least this one didn't have all that much of it, so that's a plus.

The pacing of this one was worse than any other Star Wars film.

Finn should have sacrificed himself, that would have been really good storytelling and a satisfying, respectable conclusion to his character.

Leia should have died. 

This is easily the worst Star Wars film, the only good parts were the scenes with Kylo Ren as well as the space battles, which all looked pretty good.

So many good actors were wasted in this film: Oscar Isaac, Domnhall Gleeson, Benicio Del Toro, John Boyega, Brienne of Tarthe, Mark Hamill, Laura Dern, Andy Serkis, etc. I'm not including Adam Driver or Carrie Fisher because I would not say that they were wasted in this even if I do not agree with 100% of how their characters were written.",-0.9807,453

"The last Jedi was visually beautiful, however the storyline was as awful in my opinion. So many times the story ignores physics of space. Yes it’s Star Wars but to open a door into a space craft without decompression doesn’t make sense. Nor does using gravity in space to drop bombs. There hasn’t been a situation where a Jedi or anyone had survived in space without protection ... why would this just change all of a sudden with Princess Leia? And again the new powers of Luke skywalker just transporting himself galaxies away... where has this power been for the past 6 movies? They just kept throwing stuff into the mix that has never been done before. Also the plot line literally went no where. The casino scene led no where, and the whole mission failed, and was just a disappointment. The awkward humor was sooo Disney, and all the new animals are cool but the only reason they are there is so Disney can make stuffed animals like the very one on your bed. It was super entertaining and I was never bored but the worst Star Wars movie by far as far as storyline.",-0.7775,218

"There were things I liked about this movie, and things I hated (actually it had both some of my favorite and most hated scenes from the entire franchise in it) but I would agree the points you brought up are stupid criticisms. What I hated most (other thejn Yoda's spontaneous Nazi style book burning) were the dozen or so massive plot holes.  I think once you start noting them you notice more and more and the already flawed movie starts looking like it is held together with string and spit. 
1 Why does no one in the star wars universe have auto pilot? like 6 people could have been saved if the space ships were as advanced as modern aircraft.
2 If Luke didnt want to be found, why did he leave a map to his location?
3 The First order could have destroyed the rebels at any time with their fighters, but pulled back to avoid losses, wich seems 1000% out of character for the first order.
4 They say the rebels only have 18 hours of fuel, but the rebel fuel plot takes place parallel to the Ray/Luke plot, wich clearly took at least 3 days.
5 How did the hacker betray the rebels plans? No one knew the plan, he was never on the rebel ship, and he was only near the rebels for an incredibly short time. I would guess he hacked the rebel's computers, but they dont even have autopilot, how would they have all their secret plans on computers?
6 If you can ram other ships with hyperdrive, why didnt the rebels ram all their ships into the first order just before they ran out of fuel?
7 In space if you run out of fuel, you wouldnt stop. Thanks to the law of inertia, if you ran out of fuel you would keep going straight at exactly the same speed. There is no air is space to slow them down.

Thats allot guys, half the plot makes no sense at all.",-0.9938,375

"kgbme 
I totally agree, I'm on your side. My sister liked it I'll never understand why. Don't she did understand the reasons why everyone else seems to hate it. My biggest thing was Luke. They completely desecrated Luke's character. If that one thing had been fixed I probably could have forgiven the rest of the movie. There were many other problems, the Canto Bight detour that was completely useless, Rose saving Finn, and not allowing him to sacrifice himself, the purple haired Effie from The Hunger Games. Her stupidity in getting half of the resistance wiped out because she was too proud to tell people what was going on. The fact that the resistance was so small and so in danger in the first place, because the first order had just gotten their Starkiller base blown up and they should not have been in a position to be able to be the one with the power. Nothing in this movie makes sense it's true. The cave scene, no one ever talks about that, but it started out really cool. It looked like it was going to be really cool. And then absolutely nothing happened. It sounded like there was something in there with Ray so I thought she's going to face something or have to fight something. And then she looked in the mirror and there was nothing, the echo was cool the corridor of diminishing images was cool, it all led up to a deflated balloon.
It would be like if Luke had gone into the dark side cave in Empire Strikes Back where Yoda sent him, looked around at the vines and the snakes in the lizards and then walked out and Yoda said pretty gross huh?
The fact that they made ray worse, and more entrenched her as a Mary Sue so much so that it will now be impossible to fix. They've essentially destroyed her character. The only thing they could possibly do is kill her off and do a new story arc with somebody who actually has some growth, like making Finn become a Jedi or something.
Flying through space Leia, it wasn't so much the idea that I had a problem with, I assume that she knows how to do some things with the force, it just looked silly it was poorly done.
But I could have forgiven all of that every single other shortcoming if they had not assassinated the character of Luke. They so completely and utterly desecrated his personality his attributes his character he's very core. Ryan Johnson took Banta fodder and smeared it all over who should have been the greatest Jedi of all time. And this is coming from someone who's favorite character in all of Star Wars is Yoda so that is saying a lot. That I was willing to allow Luke to pass up Yoda as the greatest Jedi ever because in Legends he was supposed to become exactly that. But no, he was a whiny grumpy angry cantankerous, pugnacious, dirty old space hobo, with creepy molesting uncle undertones. You're telling me that the one person who saw any good left in Darth Vader, the only person who thought Darth Vader could be redeemed, and was Vindicated in that belief, even though both of his master's thought he was a lost cause, and gave everything he had even be willing to sacrifice his own life to save the little Glimpse or glimmer of light left in his father, that that guy is just going to murder the son of his sister and his best friend because he's an angsty teenager? Give me a break. And then when Luke died, after not redeeming himself, because just astral projecting himself onto crate was not sufficient to redeem his character and help anybody, then the most powerful Jedi in the universe just died because he was tired? I was so furious with this movie. I actually yelled at the movie screen when Luke started to disappear. I jumped up and pointed at the movie screen and yelled don't you dare! Yeah I'm with you I will not be seeing episode 9 I'm probably not going to see the Han Solo movie. This movie never happened. I'm going to sell my Force awakens DVD and Star Wars is going to end with Return of the Jedi.",-0.8498,788
