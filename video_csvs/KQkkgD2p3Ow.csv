"***I miss U2! Ive always Loved U2 music. HOWEVER...now in it's transparency, is being used to massage mind and follow HOLLYWEIRD IDEOLOGIES! That is...it appears so. I'd Love to think the intention is of goodness and from Bono I think it may be of good INTENT but, must be careful on how we plant seed! the plant MUST be a tree that bare good fruit! Not nurture divisions and hate. BONO my brother! I love you guys! and you are of Christian faith. WE as poets, Artists and performers MUST uphold our responsibility (without stripping ourselves of creativity) uphold how we plant seed. it must be to direct, corall, and guide in GOODNESS. AGAIN...My Love for ALL walks of life and my consistent conversing and Love of Christ and his own Love for ALL walks of life must be advocates of purity and Unity as family! GOD BLESS ALL!***",0.9957,182

"Suflet american

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Binecuvântați sunt agresorii,
Într-o zi, ei vor trebui să se ridice singuri.
Ferice de cei mincinoși,
Căci adevărul poate fi incomod.
 
[Bono:]
Nu este doar un loc,
Pentru mine, această țară este un sunet
De tobe și de bas -
Îți închizi ochii pentru ca să te uiți în jur.
 
Uită-te în jur, uită-te în jur,
Uită-te în jur, e un sunet,
Uită-te în jur, uită-te în jur,
E un sunet.
 
Nu este doar un loc,
Pentru mine, această țară este un gând
Care oferă bunăvoință
Fiecărui ""bun venit"" urmărit.
 
Tu ești rock-roll,
Tu și cu mine suntem rock-roll,
Tu ești rock-roll,
Am venit aici cautând sufletul american.
 
Nu este doar un loc,
Acesta este un vis pe care îl deține întrega lume.
Fața pelerinului
Avea inima ta, să suni acasă.
 
Stai așa, frate John,
Prea multe mame plâng,
Visează, frate John,
În visele tale, nu poți să dormi.
 
Tu ești rock-roll,
Tu și cu mine suntem rock-roll,
Tu ești rock-roll,
Am venit aici cautând sufletul american,
American, american.
 
Pune-ți mâinile în aer,
Nu pierde cerul.
Ar putea fi prea târziu, dar încă mai trebuie să încercăm,
Există un moment în viață în care un suflet poate muri
Într-o persoană dintr-o țară, când crezi minciuna
Minciuna (minciuna, minciuna).
Există o promisiune în esența fiecărui vis bun,
Un apel la acțiune, nu la fantezie.
Sfârșitul unui vis, începutul a ceea ce este real.
Să fie unitate, să fie comunitate
Pentru refugiați ca tine și cu mine,
O țară care să ne primească,
Tu vei fi sanctuarul nostru.
Refu-Iisus
 
 
Tu ești rock-roll,
Tu și cu mine suntem rock-roll,
Tu ești rock-roll,
Am venit aici cautând sufletul american.
Tu ești rock-roll,
Tu și cu mine suntem rock-roll,
Tu ești rock-roll,
Am venit aici cautând sufletul american,
