"HELLO PEOPLE there are only so many formulas you can make with mascara, and only so many different wands. HONESTLY, I would personally never splurge or spend anything more expensive than the roller lash and tbh drug store brand mascaras can be fantastic, it's not hard to find a good mascara for cheap.
Mascara is one of the things I'd always buy for cheap bcuz that shit needs to be replaced often anyway too hello hygiene. 
(also I make yt vids too come check me out if you like what I said.)",0.8566,101

"Hi Jeffrey, can you comment on how the mascara came off when you tried to remove it? I love Roller Lash, but had a VERY bad experience with They're Real. Of course Benefit later on put out their own removal product for They're Real, but I'm not trying to use some super special mascara remover. I want to try Badgal Bang, but I really want to know - does it come off easily with a normal makeup removal routine (like wipes), the way Roller Lash does?",0.927,97
