"""Die"" does not mean ""to stop sweeping"". A stone ""dies"" when it loses speed faster than expected and comes to a stop short of the expected location. That's the only use of the word in Curling. To ""kill"" a stone means to take it out completely (as opposed to tapping it back).
""Off"", ""right off"", ""no"", ""woah"", ""never"", ""don't even look at it"" etc. are used to instruct sweepers to stop sweeping.",0.3322,105

"Frank Castle What are you even talking about?  Curling has literally been around for over 400 years, so don't make yourself look like a fool by dragging politics into something completely unrelated to it.  

Just like how it takes a lot of minute movements to kick a field goal in American Football, it takes a lot of sleight of hand to throw a curling rock with just the right speed, and just the right about of spin on the rock.  The force that moves the rock does not come from the thrower's arm, but from their legs when they kick off of the foothold which, again, takes a lot of know-how to get good at properly gauging since every rock takes a different amount of force.

tl:dr sports are always more complex then a quick glance might have you think.",0.7579,153

"G HL No government political speech here. All I know is what I've encountered. The only  Olympic site that my google search afforded me that had curling clips and replays, directed me to disclose which, ""provider"" that I was already subscribed. I didn't have a cable, satellite or landline phone company other than Straittalk prepaid from Wal-Mart. That was not enough to view clips or replays of anything Olympic. Comcast was the provider for the coverage in the US and that was their price. 
     Congratulations to Canada for recognizing a truly enjoyable sporting event. It has become one of my favorite events of the Olympics. Sorry you guys didn't take the gold this time.

"Luisa Carrera sweeping a stone has a few uses 
So the first one is to help the stone go further. This is because as someone so sweeping thy are melting the top layer of ice, meaning that the thin layer of water will help the stone go a little further 
It also helps keep the stone straight because the sweeper closer to the stone is sweeping against the curl of the stone. This means it prevents the stone from curling as easily 
Sweeping is very important for every shot so it’s essential to the game 
I hope that helped!!",0.9515,106

"Sweeping in curling is done for two reasons, to increase the curl of a rock and to increase the distance traveled by the rock.  Sweeping does not make the rock travel straighter or faster.  The difference of a curl and distance traveled between a swept and an unswept rock can be up to 20% if I'm not incorrect.  I saw a small clip on it a while ago so my memory for the numbers might be wrong.  But suffice to say, sweeping can dramatically change the curl of a rock and how far it goes.  It can be the difference between a successful throw or a horrible miss.  You won't see curlers sweeping a rock that's meant to travel straight and fast since that's usually traveling too fast for them to keep up and that rock doesn't need to curl.  A rock that is thrown straight and fast is called a takeout rock.  Those rocks usually don't stay in play themselves because they fly out of the target area and take everything it hits out with them.

If you don't know what I mean by curl, curl refers to how much of a curved path a rock takes.  The more curl, the more curved the path is.  The less curl, the more straight the path is.  The challenge of curling comes from throwing rocks with just the right amount of curl and weight behind them to take out your opponent's rocks while placing your own rocks in strategic positions to score as many points as possible while making it difficult for your opponent to take out your rocks.",0.169,287
