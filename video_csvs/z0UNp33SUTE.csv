"I’ve had my spot for a few hours now, and overall I think it’s a good device.
The good: it’s surprisingly good but the bedside. Wait adjustments are good and the LED does not keep you up at night. The sound is better than the dot. The display is somewhat useful, and overall it’s a good replacement for the old bedside clock. 
The bad: It uses a non-standard power cord when a high-capacity USB connection would have worked fine. Custom power connector is OK, if you have an internal USB power for a second device, but it does not do that.  It doesn’t have battery back up although the alarm will work if you lose Internet.  There aren’t enough clock options, both analog and digital faces are limited, but it is acceptable
The ugly: as many have said the bedside camera. About to solutions for this, and I use both. Turn off the Camera via the settings menu, and then take two small pieces of translucent scotch tape cut into a small circle and stick over camper. This prevents the camera from getting a picture, but allows enough light for the sensor. Second ugly point is the price. It’s about $20-$30 too expensive",0.6868,246
