"I don't hold to much stock in what they say when it comes to it being an intersteller object. Our solar system is so large that there are gazillions of asteroids were not aware of and probably never will. The found it tacked it for a couple of days or even weeks and based on their projections it came from outside our solar system. Well they've done that before numerious times only to find out their calculations as to the exact trajectory really is or in some cases was.

It is feaseable that this asteroid has been here all along and becasue of a ever so slight collosion with another, it's trajectory placed it in a location in which we happen to find it. We have dozens of big telescopes but not near enough to check the entire night sky from every point on Earth on a continuse bases. Thus gazillions of objects will never ever be seen. And when they are, their trajectories may have been different which changes where they came from.

I mean Earth hasn't always been it its exact location, it's taken eons of millenials to be in the location we are. Based on out longivity we can determine our previous and present trajectory to a point. Provided of course there has never been nor ever will be a collision that would or has changed it.

Star Shot style mirco-probes might be one idea, for disposable one off flybys?

I wonder if the Deep Space Gateway would be a good place for housing a pursuit probe for the next odd rock we want to closely examine? There was talk of probes that could visit asteroids and come back after all.

I hear we are short on Pu for RTGs, since the vast majority was produced decades ago and is ""going stale"". But I also heard of a U235 reactor called KRUSTY that can actually be turned off instead of constant decay like a RTG and the whole 700m year halflife is certainly better than less than 24 for the Pu RTGs. Plus the facilities for making KRUSTY fuel is the mainline production anyway. Turning bomb material in in fuel instead, how cool is that? 

Now I know KRUSTY is in cooldown at present so they can examine the system to see how it held up to the depleted U test before entrusting it with and active fuel core, but how would such a power system change the make up of a pursuit or asteroid hunting probe? Better engine, etc?",0.9286,272

And the only pictures available are the ones NASA paid artists to paint.  Meaning they tell the artist what to paint and they paint it... 
What does this mean?  There are no official pictures of the object and therefore it's likely not actually what the photo shows.  Why?  The world is not ready for a full on UFO disclosure.  But this odd looking meteorite simply is a test to prepare society for full UFO disclosure.
