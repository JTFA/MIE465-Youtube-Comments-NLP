"+MollyBurkeOfficial  *Thanks for the field demo of two models of Braille embossers.*  One ""dream machine"" of mine would be a sheet-feeding dot- or line-matrix printer for computers that could shift the ink ribbons clear of the print head for side B; such could print visible text on the first pass, then punch in the Braille on the second, given properly-calibrated software.  Incidentally, how many character cells per inch?  I could use the information to select the correct monospace font (e.g. LinUX Libertine Display O as first choice, or Courier New as a fallback) for the visible text.",0.4019,117

"Don't forget you can also get electronic braille readers with displays that refresh when you've read them. They're especially important for deafblind people who can't hear audio books, but also, if you want to see what is being read out (if it's a foreign word that the screen reader gets wrong, for example), they're useful.

VoiceOver also supports them -- a few weeks ago a deafblind lady I follow on Twitter mentions that she uses VoiceOver and I asked *how* and she said VoiceOver supports braille displays. (I'd read recently of another deafblind woman who'd had a cochlear implant fitted after 25 years of no hearing and only light perception, so I wonder if she'd done the same.) I'd thought iOS would support them somehow but I hadn't realised it was through VoiceOver, simply because of the name.",0.8511,156

So she can see vague shapes moving around, since there is light behind things. As for the typewriter, and other objects, she's used to memorizing where things are. To her, that is as easy as seeing, because she's been blind so long. We don't typically memorize the placement of things because our sight makes that unnecessary, but blind people have to remember where everything is, and since they're used to it, it's second nature to them. If you lost your vision, eventually certain things that seem impossible now would  also become second nature to you with practice.",-0.3919,134

And yes, blind people can appreciate patterns and things even though they can't see it. She loves fashion and makeup even  though she can't see it. We sighted people aren't used to living in a world where you can't see anything so it's hard to relate, but I take it that she simply chooses to have faith in the fact that the paper is striped because someone told her it is. And even though she can't see it, simply _knowing_ that fact is enough for her to appreciate the difference between patterned and unpatterned paper.

"There are bill readers that you insert the edge of the bill in and it orally states what kind of bill it is.  It can then be folded appropriately for each value and placed in a wallet correctly. I am sighted, but I am a special education teacher with visually impaired students.",0.6428,56

"This is great!!! You can tell Karlie is actually interested and wants to learn more about blindness and Braille, more so than just doing it for the photo. I never had any particular feelings towards her, but now I like her just from this video",0.8189,51
"This is great. When I was a kid our favorite babysitter was a blind teen who lived across the street. She taught me both finger spelling (she had a deaf friend and that was how they communicated) and how to read and write Braille using the very old-fashioned metal ""slate and stylus."" It took me about a year to become reasonably fluent in writing and reading Braille, then I could write secret messages to the babysitter. I've never seen the machines in this video, a great invention. Thank you, Molly, for raising awareness through your channel.",0.9349,110

"This was super interesting! I can read the alphabet in Braille, but I didn't really know anything about the Braille writer, or how you can make your own labels for things around the house/office.

I'm curious: you mention learning math in school with a Braille textbook. Often in sighted textbooks there're lots of diagrams and pictures and especially graphs (because a lot of mathematical intuition comes from our spatial reasoning, so seeing the space laid out in a graph makes the abstract idea of a ""function"" more concrete). When doing math and science in Braille, do you have something similar? If not (or even if so), how did you learn geometry, or algebra and calculus (a lot of which is quite visual, at least when taught to sighted students, because it involves looking at the aforementioned graphs)?

Or in fact, something simple like tables for organizing information - that seems like it should translate well into Braille but of course I wouldn't know. Or on a screenreader, how does it read out tabular information?",0.9454,203

"Yep! She has an eye disease that caused her to be legally blind from birth, and her eyesight diminished until she could only see some light at age 14(I think?). So she was looking at a bright light above the camera instead of actually at the camera, and she was looking towards the sound of Karlie's voice instead of actually at Karlie :)",0.7263,71
"Yes she's blind. ""She doesn't look blind!"" is the most common reaction from new people lol. She explains these common questions in her videos so you should go check out her channel :)",0.7263,38
"Yes, Molly is blind. She can see bright lights which is why her eyes usually face the camera, there‚Äôs a bright light behind it. But that‚Äôs all.",0.7003,36
