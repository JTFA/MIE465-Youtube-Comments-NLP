Probably not well I can tell you, that it involves a periodic background checks and biometrics and proof of high school education and college attendance to get approve.

Accepting that we are equal does not ignore that we are individuals at all. That simply makes no sense. We are all equal and men who recognize that they have self worth have no reason to fear others. I think that your personal feelings are allowing you to misinterpret what I am saying. We must work together to make a future not just for ourselves but for everyone. If you don't want to do that, well yes, step aside. 

I never said you are an enemy if you don't participate.That is your way of thinking not mine. If you are just not doing anything to benefit anyone other than yourself what good are you?  Don't try to stop others from making a future together. That is what this country was built on. Men who are insecure fear competition. We are all capable of contributing to the greater good so why carry around fear?  You may not believe that because so many people today are self indulgent and self centered and care for no one other than themselves. 

Jesus did not ""distinguish"" between foe and friend. Why should we? I get a kick however out of listening to so many right wing Christians exclude anyone that isn't like them. I can't tell if you do that or not. If you do, then you don't understand the Bible that you preach. Your Bible that you quote so much is a bastardized version of what Jesus taught anyway.

Gabby Ortiz like I said just go through the immigration process it is intense for a reason we want to make sure the best people are coming through if you make it to simple to get through then you risk over population something we are already facing the point is we don‚Äôt want to let just anyone come across we want people we know are good members of society remember they aren‚Äôt US citizens if we didn‚Äôt want to let people immigrate into the country at all we don‚Äôt have to but we do as long as they can pass our test and to be honest marriage shouldn‚Äôt grant you citizenship you should still have to go through the process everyone else has to,0.9306,134

This was a shoddy deal from the beginning, but there is a compromise to be made here. But it requires some give from both sides of the aisle. I want DACA to be protected, but I equally want the other bad immigration policies reworked or done away with all together.

When it comes to kids illegally being here for decades I feel they should stay as long  as they are law abiding but we should not make an effort to defend law breaking illegal immigrants who kill and steal knowing they can since they are difficult to track down and even if they are tacked down states like California are hesitant to prosecute because that murderer could be a vote.

Of course, many of these costs are absorbed by local jurisdictions and the federal government, but the drain on the State of California remains significant.  As such, the question is no longer whether California ought to allow illegal immigration‚Äîit‚Äôs whether the State can afford it.

Illegal immigration is expensive: two recent studies from the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the National Economics Editorial peg the annual cost of illegal immigration to America between $135 and $140 billion.  And of all the states, California bears the largest burden due to its sizable illegal population.

DACA becomes an American problem because the number of Latinos and Hispanics invaded the USA has reached beyond 60 millions.  The US welcomes a diversity of immigrants through the legal process, but the majority is illegals from Mexico and Latin America.  The time to put an end to this Latinos/Hispanics invasion was years ago, but the twisted, devious politicians fear of being labeled as racist, so they turn a blind eye.

President Trump was elected, because he‚Äôs the only one who got the balls to say as it is and tell as it is, unlike the twisted, devious politicians. I‚Äôm almost certain President Trump will get re-elected in 2020 to complete his mission.  President Trump must put an end to DACA and deport all of the illegals.  If this country didn‚Äôt have the rule of law, it would turn into one of those slum countries as where these illegals come from.",-0.9175,177

"P B303 Solo Patriot As a person who knows an illegal alien, I can tell you from firsthand knowledge that they CAN'T receive welfare or any government benefits. To the extent that illegals use up our money is through our healthcare system where hospitals are forced to treat anyone if it's an emergency, but since many dont have insurance because they dont have legal employment therefore cant get it through their employer, the hospital eats the cost and therefore affects our economy. Allow them to get employment legally, and this problem goes away. AND it creates more jobs thus improving the employment rate and the economy through taxes. There's literally no reason to not pass a bill like DACA (where they still dont qualify for any government benefits) except for the cry babies that like to complain BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IT THE LEGAL WAY!! Oh please. It's a piece of paper. Not murder. Yes it's the law but it's got a ridiculously easy fix. Just change it.",-0.8866,185

It takes brains, work and ambition to win a Nobel prize and that my friend means more than you will ever begin to understand. Have you been honored with one? I don't think so. Go back to school, get an education and leave the thinking and the work to the immigrants who work hard and move this country forward as they have from day one. If you can't be part of the solution for a better future get out of the way and let others move it forward. Don't sit on your ass and criticise and complain because you can't handle the competition from people who are willing to do what you wouldn't consider doing. They pick up the work that your kids would laugh at if asked to do. Americans are for the most part useless anymore. Lazy, sniveling, self serving, cry babies who want for themselves but are unwilling to work for it and don't give two shits about the earth, the environment or anyone other than themselves. Kids today think that everything should be handed to them. The laziest country on earth so when people enter it and want to work you want them thrown out. I bet your a Bible thumping Christian too who has forgotten Christ's message of ""Love thy neighbor."" Right now you are standing in the middle of the highway.

At an average annual cost of $7,500 (averages vary by jurisdiction) per student, the cost of providing education to these children is about $11.2 billion.""

"marksasoldier First of all, there are birth certificates and social security cards to label what country someone was born in and more importantly what country they belong to. And again, they're pieces of PAPER. The only reason you have those papers are because you were born here. Immigrants CHOSE to be here. Hell I'd trust them with my country over you any day.  But birth is not always correlated with someone's right to be in a country. That is evidenced by the immigration system. We and every other country in the world, allow for people born in other countries that choose and want to be a part of that specific country,to become one of their citizens.  So no, there is literally no difference between you, and a person who was raised here. Birth means nothing except that you're entitled and obviously take it for granted. Also second of all, Mexico IS a shithole.  Even Mexicans themselves know this. It's run by corruption, organized crime, and poverty.  However  the Mexican culture is BEAUTIFUL and its people are some of the most hard working, dignified, honest people out there. So it really is unfortunte that its government has cheated its people and the country isn't thriving as well as it should. But anyway, yes these people escape this situation in seek of a better life, and safety. Yes it's easy to say ""do it the legal way"" and I'd guarantee most people (unless you really are a bad criminal and have malicious intents) would do it the ""legal way"". Our current legal route is a 10 year process that's expensive, very extensive, and many dont even make it anyway.  Highly unrealistic and inaccessible to the average person. As of now basically the only way to get here is either be a celebrity, rich, or a Nobel prize winner. This is why even Trump himself acknowledges the fact that we need to reform our immigration system. But til then, we need to deal with the ones already here. And that starts by helping out the ones who were raised here and know no other country except this one, and showing more empathy.



Oh. And dont give me any of that ""they should go back and fix their own country"" crap.
