"""Perri just singled out the chemistry between the leads as one of the best things about it""

Sure, and a ton of the critics all singled out the chemistry as being bad..... And I agree with them. Difference of opinions......

""If it was that bad, why did the audience broadly enjoy it?""

Depends on where you look.... There is no true verified audience score as the film was on Netflix. Netflix only let's it's audience thumbs up or thumbs down a movie, so it's no better of an aggregate than RT. They took away their star rating system for this very reason. I think the general consensus on the film was ""meh"". IMDB has it at a 6.5. Metacritic has it at a 7.3. And again, those are user scores, so they really mean nothing other than a portion of it's audience disagree with the abysmally low scores the critics gave it. If we follow your argument, then Suicide Squad was a good film, right??? Or Justice League???",0.5305,199
"*Why is Perri so impressed with Disney making so much money with only 6 movies?* They’re all franchise blockbusters made for millions of children....what did she expect? Of course they were going to make lots of money.

"Actually Unicron was kinda the same thing in Transformers Prime. They just didn't execute it as well as in that show. 

But yes I can definitely agree that they fucked up by not using the Quintessons. In Age of Extinction (which I love btw) they set it up beautifully. Lockdown makes a lot of vague references to ""The Creators"" and we assumed it was the Quintessons. But no... it was Quintessa... the ""Prime of life"". Sure. How about instead of the constant Autobot vs Decepticon conflict, we get the Quintessons to spice things up? Nope. Quintessa. Another Prime... supposedly. >.>

The problem I have with the movies is NOT the stuff everyone constantly complains about. It's the fact that the movies keep tripping over themselves with the lore! With The Last Knight out, they practically ignore the events of previous movies. Or at least they TRY to but they don't but then we're not sure if it was SUPPOSED to be like that or what.",0.5788,193

Granted WW had that, but she was featured in JL and that movie bombed. So overall, no DC nor the DCEU get credit for your statement.",0.8324,139

they´re all loosers baby, why were they even made at all.

it, split, get out, deadpool shows there´s an audience for r rated movies. alien.

why make a parody of merlin? hope they focus on only bumblebee for a few movies if this movie is even good.
then they could bring in a few of the others and all of them after that?

cut ticket prices in half. if you want more to go to the theater of course. perhaps it´s only for the privileged these days...
entertainment i mean.

you think this walter hermada is as greedy as his s#¤% predecessor? let´s hope movies get less budget and more creativity
from now on. also less marketing over all, let´s save some money for everyone down the line. 

why wouldn't walter hermada take over the dark universe then? if horror.

well those girls were probably f#¤%ng damaged in the head in the 1st place. or they just wanted to see what it was like killing right.
only in the u.s.? 15 minutes of fame... unnecessary f#¤%ng people. they could have just killed each other...

why call it death wish? should denzel, foseter, bacon, caine and gibsons revenge movies be death wish too? just give it another name?..
i do like vengeance stuff :). there´re many good.

smylex, truth or deodorant?

superhero/comic book movies lesser budget could just mean NO MARKETING! how much cheaper would star wars or mcu suffer from no marketing?
a star wars horror would be sweet. something with the ""negative space""? or that sentient water planet? that bothan spy movie could 
be a good star wars thriller and the kenobi move could be a western. why aren't peoople working only for back end on movies like star wars and the mcu?
like they´re likely to fail right. it´s insane that entertainment costs 100´s of millions to make...

how about 50 000 budget for the western?
