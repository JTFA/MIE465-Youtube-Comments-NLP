"hello mister JohnnyQ90 im jost a nother fan of your videos and i ask if is possibull to study a way to built a werd glow engine im talking about Opposed-Piston Engine im not talking about the traditional boxer engine thas easy. im talking about the other one too pistons head to head in the same chamber, now thas a challenge no one ever build and make it to work. can you ? hoop so!",0.5562,80

i think you must try PEEK filament.,0.0,8
"it is classified as a big block, any .21 or over is a big block, anything less a small block, however there are much larger motors, ive heard of up to .49",-0.8271,38
"it is interesting to notice that the rod handled pretty well the static and dynamic loads generated by the piston movement, despite the fact that it failed because of the friction at the bearing points",0.743,36
"it melted under the heat, it's plastic after all, but I think there are plastics that could withstand that, either way a really interesting test",0.611,28
"it's be interesting to see how long it would last with a metal bushing in the ends, something like phosphor bronze, instead of the petg because it looks like it failed because of friction at that point",0.5267,39

you have a idea and you do it , it's fun and it can be a step toward a new idea and and and , in last find a new technique or discover something revolutionnary ... or nothing ...

And the first man (or woman) take some food near fire , with all the tribe said ""it will be carbonated !!! it will be destroy !!! I know what will happen , why you do it?"" 
and this persone discover the french cuisine !!

lolatmyage I'm going to leave this discussion. I have expressed my sentiments and have nothing further to add.,-0.0516,20
"lolatmyage Value is completely subjective and determined by the one creating the hypothesis and the experiment to test it. If Johnny can find a plastic type, printing pattern, and dimensions of a plastic conrod that achieve demonstrable longevity and durability, he has discovered a way to save weight within an RC vehicle and alter the parameters of the engine. 

FYI, lots of accidental discoveries occur in science as a result of a simple ""what if"" experiment.",0.8933,85
"lolatmyage You're failing to see the fundamental principle that underlies the spirit of experimentation and the scientific method. Go watch Johnny's other videos where he revises his prototypes several times because he made new discoveries. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to agree with either of you that there is absolutely no benefit to this. There is a benefit of everything in science, even failure.",-0.3547,71
lolatmyage it can... I would Google how to do it... If done right you can double the strength but it won't help if the part is overheating...,-0.1991,30
"lolatmyage the idea is to experiment with the longevity of the part made from that material. Those tiny cheapo tire inflation pumps use plastic rods, so why not try an RC motor? Hand crafting that tiny dog bone would be much harder, and probably not much faster than printing one",0.4939,54

"nice vid Johnny! Since you are the best with the lathe, I would like you to introduce brushless motors to your channel (high KV motors to be exactly), Could you make a big gear with 5 brushless motor around  connected in parallel to convert 50k rpm to 5k  rpm? those motors are really powerful but not really efficient at 50k rpm and would be a great idea to move a large prop or to use it on a go-kart or e bike, there are plenty of 3750 KV motors on internet and they are powerful and cheap! but a big brushless motor is really expensive !",0.9397,114

print a rod again and use bronze bearings. It would be interesting to see how long will it last then,0.4019,21
"short test arent enough, you'd have to see how long the material lasts. It could fail both because of fatigue or just wear.  Even if it could withstand the temperature, plastic is somewhat elastic, everytime it stretches and contracts it breaks a little, and after a while, it will break like most plastic hinges. 
Then you have the high speed metal sliding on soft plastic problem, that even with oil, i doubt it will last long before breaking or becoming so lose that it starts failing.
all in all, there's a reason why they dont make cylinder heads out of wood, the same reason as to why you dont make engines out of plastic parts: They do not have suitable properties for the job, they arent cheaper than their aluminium counterpart,  and they are faaaar lest robust than metal ones and so last way less. 
The time you spend changing it when it breaks probably costs more than what you save by making it in plasitc.",-0.8552,184
