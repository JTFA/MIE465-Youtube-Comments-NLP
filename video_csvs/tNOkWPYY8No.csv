"Honestly, Wind River delivered probably the best performance of Jeremy Renner's career. It's a mystery/noir that's a slow burn but well worth it. Gil Birmingham, and Graham Greene also shine in captivating performances. The cinematography was amazing in capturing the tone of the filme, but again it's the performances that knock it out of the park. In the end, Wind River delivers a very a tragic message but it is one that allows for its viewers to have an introspective look into America's history with Native Americans and it's dynamic. I'm not gonna lie, after watching this movie it stayed in my mind for days. I find it disheartening that such a relevant film that shows a contemporary perspective on the relationship between Americans and Native Americans/First Nations is being dismissed for some films that by comparison are predictable. There's so much buzz about how there needs to be more diversity, so why is a worthy film like Wind River lagging behind? It's as good, and imo better than Lady Bird which just fell flat for me. I know this is just my opinion, but at this point it's just a popularity contest :(",0.9653,215
