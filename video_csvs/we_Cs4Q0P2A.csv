Ilsunny Lo Both the steerman and the brake man have memorized the  course before they ever step into the sled. The steerman is low too but he is actually looking forward to steer the sled. He chooses how high or low on the wall they go. If they're too high and can't make the next turn they go sailing through the air into the inside of the next turn at 90 mph. People can die when that happens. The brake man slows the sled to help the steerman steer. But the brake man's ultimate job is to go fast.,-0.7184,106

"Jiaming Yu well luge is on a sled type thing and the person is on their back with their head back but they can see where they're going. It's done in singles and doubles. In bobsleigh it's done in groups of two or groups of four. In luge you use your feet to move your body. In bobsleigh all group members use their bodies to sway right or left and have a member that controls the break inside, like the athlete in the video. Perhaps you weren't expecting this whole response but the winter olympics has me hyped!!!",0.6884,107

"The story is cool but The production of this is absurd. I wanted to show my son what bobsledding is, because we were talking about the Olympics.

Yeah it takes a lot of control with the controls in the front plus lots of leaning and staying for aerodynamica. Basically skiing in steroids as a group in a rocket's cockpit. Lol lol dangerous just the G force is rough compared to other sports...5*your weight imagine that. Although fighter polits have been known to fly in the 9 to 10 Gs but they also have a suit to stop the flow of blow in their legs which does not happen in bobsleg. Its a crazy sport. Lol lol,0.631,98
