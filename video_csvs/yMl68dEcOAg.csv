"68/73 threaded BBs and Hollowtech II cranks work so well, and they are home mechanic friendly. They give up about 100-200 grams vs carbon cranks, (For a savings of hundreds of dollars,) in what is probably the least important area of the bike to save weight. A direct mount would be nice, but the system works good as is. I'm curious what SRAM is up to with DUB, but I'm not really seeing the benefit yet.",0.9507,87
"All benefits I see so far is for SRAM: cheaper manufacturing - one spindle length/diameter less steps to produce etc. - and can be sold for more as the ""latest and greatest"".

Alternatives? Hope, Chris King. For their price, I could change the BB like 20 times in case of bearing failure - which is exactly what happened after ONE day of muddy riding with my Rotor. Bearings stuck on both sides.
