"Great project! I am thinking of doing something similar and I am wondering why you let the three pumps run individually instead of running them all at once, is it because the power supply can't deal with that effect? and why do you use a scale? if I'm correct you only use it to see when a liquid enters the glass to know when to start the timer. Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't it be easier to just scrap the scale and measure the passed time after the pump is activated, maybe you'll need to make up for the extra time it takes for the liquid to go through to the tube but that wouldn't be so hard I think.",-0.6651,129

"Just a quick tip regarding wood glue: it works best when gluing two surfaces together, but is terrible at filling gaps. So instead of gluing the wood together with superglue and then filling the gaps with wood glue, I would only use wood glue. A thin layer is enough to create a super strong bond, it just needs some compression during drying. Ordinary clamps are totally fine, but when working with a rectangular shape, strap clamps are really useful. Gaps, should they remain, can be filled using wood glue mixed with an equal amount of saw dust.
