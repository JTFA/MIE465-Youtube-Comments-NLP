Just a little thing to add to your very first point. The word meme comes from the world of genetics. It’s a gene that is passed down from generation being changed slightly down the line.

Now, I have a question, and maybe I'm just way behind the FX curve, but is it possible to do this trick using chroma key and green screen? I don't have a lot of tech or computer programs. I have an old Final Cut Studio suite and a camera that came out before they started using memory cards.
