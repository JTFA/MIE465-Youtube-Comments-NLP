"Breastfeeding is HARD!! First time everything went well for me, then the second time it wouldn't work at all and I was in so so so much pain. I'm really glad it's working out for you!
I wasn't on a pink clound either when my daughter was born. It took some getting used to and I used to feel so guilty about it but it's such a lie. It's like you're supposed to feel this one way but everyone deals with it differently. In the end, you went through a trauma giving birth and you need time to get over that.
Take enough time for yourself! Really, take care :-) and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. She'll grow up so fast (I know everyone says that, but this part at least is true...)",0.9755,150

"Congratulations on River Wren.  Do know that if you are using a baby monitor one should be sure to use the control that allows no strangers to hack into the baby's room and see her, see you breastfeed or run possibly run into the room and you are wrapped in a towel to tend to the baby.  I am not trying to scare you but there was a kook in London who got caught spying on kids in America, the case that got the man caught was a child he spied on in Dallas, TX. He was yelling nasty things at the child, and fortunately, the kid was deaf and didn't hear the nasty things that were said.  You can find this information on the internet about the creeps that troll baby monitors and spy on people and their kids.  I am just making a suggestion for your families safety, not because you are a blogger.  Just for the safety of your child. I like the name River.  It beats the name ABCJKL that a girl in my college dorm named her kid and one would pronounce the name A bee cee ja kel. The name ABCJKL is a train wreck if you ask me and will not provide the kid a great chance at success.  I am sure you already know that broccoli and other vociferous vegetables when breastfeeding  will give the baby a tummy ache as their tiny body can't break down vociferous vegetables yet and they get horrible gas pains and terrible belly aches that keep them up and crying.  So many babies get baby acne and new mom's sometimes feel that makes the baby less perfect.  The acne will go away and all those smiles and gurgles will keep your heart filled.  Thank you for sharing your baby.  You do what you and River need to do and share only what you are comfortable sharing.   Cheers!  Congratulations to Mike as well.",0.9881,348

I felt the same way with both my daughters births. With everything going on giving birth it really didn’t impacts that the baby was here. Wish I would have recorded to watch at a later time.

"River is a trendy name for dogs in California, at least this is what I have seen from working at a dog boarding and daycare facility. Now PLEASE don't get me wrong, I am NOT comparing your baby to dogs, I'm just saying that the name is going around and people are naming what they love the name River. 😊❤ All this to say, I don't think people should find the name weird, I think they should find it beautiful because of the peaceful mental imagery the word river gives you. I love it! I think the more unique thing about her name is that you've chosen to go with two of the same beginning sounds ""r,"" River Wren. That's something I haven't heard, including the name Wren, so that's super neat and unique. All this to say, how awesome Fleur and Mike!!! So happy for you both, actually, you three and your doggies.
