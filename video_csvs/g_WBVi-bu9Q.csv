"A good job and kind of fun.  :-)

But as a professional CG EFX artist and software engineer I'm calling ""bullsh*t"" on the same old grounds I always do, ie: there is no real-time modeling of occluding geometry.  The wall in the first corridor is clearly NOT being used by the system to produce an occlusion mask against which the renderer maps the girl.  The biggest giveaway showing that the wall (and other geometry) is not being recognized (ie: not there) is that her shadow does not go up the wall or trash-can correctly -- the shadow, like the girl, is simply being superimposed in front of the live video image (ie: like old ""front-screen projection"" as used in the ancient King Kong movie).  The only thing the AR is really doing is tracking the camera's position/orientation from a pre-registered origin point (probably using an IMU and/or optical flow analysis).  It might also be finding the average ground-plane but I doubt even that {see below).  At first I thought that MAYBE the system was also at least finding the square shape of the video monitor sitting suspiciously in the middle of the large empty room, but upon closer examination one can see what are very likely registration marks on the ground (white rectangles) showing exactly where to put the tv cabinet.  (And what is that big box behind the flat screen?).  Finally, between time 0:49 and 0:53 the newly encountered corridor wall is (finally) being used to occlude/crop the girl as she comes in to view; not doing this would show her behind the wall after the user had turned the corner, ie: like x-ray vision, totally ruining the effect. Admirably her shadow is also being mapped against the new wall (unlike the earlier corridor wall) -- unfortunately the registration of the wall is very poor and the shadow ""bends"" at the wrong place where the wall meets the floor.

MY professional assessment:  The entire scenario relies upon substantial preparation, very simple 3D modeling of a few selected walls/props, and  pre-registration of everything.  My professional eye says they pre-modeled the monitor and at least the second corridor wall (and even that wall/plane was not placed or registered well).  I see no evidence that any other physical geometry in the room other than these 2 planar objects was pre-modeled, and certainly no evidence that ANY of the physical world was being detected or modeled in real-time;  rather the abundant evidence cries the contrary.

Bottom line:  This is another dishonest depiction of AR, relying on a lot of preliminary work and the judicious use of ""smoke'n'mirrors"" in the placement of props, registration of simple pre-modeled 3D objects, and careful user-navigation of the AR goggles so as not to reveal the trickery.  Sadly, there is nothing new here.  Just the same dishonesty we've been shown before.  PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG -- I'd love for it to be true.",-0.9182,570
