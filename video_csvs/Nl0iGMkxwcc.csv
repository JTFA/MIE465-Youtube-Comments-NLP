Who is better is subjective.
Nike has higher sale volume because it produces more than Adidas.
And one of the reasons to that is because of huge american market that is predominant Nike and consists almost half of Nikes revenue. Adidas or Puma don t have that much domestic consumers.

In Europe Adidas is still the most popular and 1# sport manufacturer also their products are in general better quality than Nike. 
Yes Nike sneakers and cleats are also very popular here but you would see more Trefoil and three stripe pant, shirt, jacket than swoosh. And you will likely see mostly samba and other Adidas classic sneakers at a football match in ENgland or Spain or everywhere in Europe.",0.8173,132

"No, Adolf is not pronounced with ay at the beginning - unless your're an English speaker. The ay sound would be written as ""ei"" or maybe ""√§"" in German. A is always a in German - we don't change the pronounciation of characters (ok, we're not quite as strict as Spanish in that regard but it's sufficient as a rule of thumb). Not like in English where eg. in ""age"" the ""a"" sounds totally different than in ""alter"" and different again in ""argue"". I'd say the a in ""argue"" is most like the German a.",0.7096,119
"No, there's no stress on the ee sound, the a in the beginning is not drawn out and there is no o at the and. It's pronounced like ""addition"" in the beginning with kind of a double d sound and and the end ""das"" is pronounced like ""class"".",-0.5267,58
"No, with an A, not an ""uh"". Like, hmm, like the ""a"" in ""argue"". And the d sound is not doubled on the last d but on the first d.

Geez, it's just so hard to describe German pronounciation to non-natives using ""normal"" English characters because you English speakers always think of them differently than I, as a native German speaker do.
Also, because German has a rather fixed set of how a character is pronounced which English has not. Eg. when I write an ""A"" there's basically one way a German native will pronounce the character while an Englisch native will pronounce it anywhere from what Germans would call an ""A"" to a ""√Ñ"" to an ""O"".

Maybe just try this: https://dict.leo.org/englisch-deutsch/Addition and play the spoken example on the German side for ""die Addition"". Then take the first part of Addition and add ""das"" spoken to rhyme with the English word ""class"" and that's how we German natives pronounce Adidas.
Don't ask me why we pronounce it with the double d sound (which is also quite a common spelling error over here) since we don't pronounce neither ""Adi"" nor ""Adolf"" with a double d sound. I have no idea where that comes from.",-0.9136,251

"Oh, I now get it, you mean ""uh"" like in eg. the gulf of mexico?
To me, when I read ""uh"" I think of something like the wooohoo sounds owls make. So I guess I misunderstood you when you asked about ""uh dolf"" - but the a in Adidas, Adolf, etc is not like the u in gulf, it's most like the a in ""argue"", so that type of a + dolf so that it rhymes with ""golf"".
And Adidas with the A from ""argue"", the dd+i sound from ""addition"" + das rhyming with ""class"". Now you can go shoe shopping in Germany.",0.7998,135

So, it starts off like ""addition"" and ends in ""dass"" with a short A and a snappy S sound (kind of like ""class"").
