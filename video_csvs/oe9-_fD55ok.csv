"Doritos aside, Women used to have so much class and be on just a totally different level held at such high regards like no other... Now they all just want to be downgraded to everyday slobbish man level because it somehow makes them think or feel more ""equal"" like they are finally ""rising up"" to the ""privileged"" mans level...
