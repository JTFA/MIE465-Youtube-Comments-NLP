"Agp has truly left his mark on the internet and i hope everyone knows that. I have watched them for some year's now,maybe not since the beginning but defiantly for a while. I don't use a youtube account to watch youtube so i was never subscirbed nor liked any of there videos but i defiantly watched them. Mike has done so much for him and i hope he feels complete knowing that he had done so. I hope for mike and his family's sake that they all take a break from the internet. I know agp wouldn't want that but it's time to grief sadly. I wish i could have sent agp a letter when they were doing all that and it kinda irritates me that i didn't do so even though i was tempted. Agp has made me smile and laugh and he will be truly missed but never forgotten.",0.9467,161

"At least AGP was out of that hospital, the last thing I wanted for him was to still be there, at least he was where he wanted to be and around people he loves and that is all you can hope for. I believe AGP will always watch over everyone just because you are in one place doesn't mean you have to stay there. I believe ghosts are real and you can still visit and be around the people you love. Michael really is the best and he has gone above and beyond making his father proud along with making the rest of his family proud. As for Charlie I hope now the horrible stuff you said about your own father is now echoing in your head, there is still time, turn your life around, get a job, stay off the alcohol and drugs, even if the rest of the family want nothing to do with you turn your life around for you still could make the father you said you hated (probably when you where intoxicated) proud. There is always hope. Do it now as there is now no way for you to say sorry.",0.966,212

Thank y'all so much for entertaining me, and I'm truly sorry for the Loss. I will never forget him and his laugh. He will definitely go down in the record books for me. What hurts me the most is the fact that I'll never see him again, but I'll always have his videos on YouTube. I'm truly heartbroken IRL, and I can only imagine how much pain Mike is in.

"This is so saddening, I knew his time with us here was coming to an end and I didn’t want to believe it but deep down I knew it was coming soon.  Lost my grandfather earlier this year and still have one left from my moms side.  Watching agp for about three years has brought many laughter and emotions to me and helps fill in the gap of my grandfather I lost earlier this year.  AGP taught us to stay true to ourselves and to stand up for ourselves.  He was one tough angry and lovable guy that many may misinterpret him as a rude person but the respect he earned by staying true to himself even after becoming famous on YouTube and turning his life around since then is what is so inspirational about him.  I have made videos similar to AGP about my other grandfather who is still alive as his personality is one of a kind just like AGPs and with the videos I make of him I can forever preserve the memories of him and show him to my future children just like mike will do with his future children.  Mike and AGG taught us to value family as one day our loved ones won’t be there anymore.   AGP will never die as he will always be alive through the hearts of his fans and through his legacy on YouTube.",0.9935,247

We definitely lost a hell raiser.. he shook the earth with his yelling and smashing things up but he was the greatest man ever. He loved everyone and he would never miss a chance to make us ALL laugh. Yes AGP left us too fast (I honestly thought he was gonna make it through cause all the signs we're promising for the most part) and it will catch up to us all and it will hit like a brick but us youngins need to be strong for AGP and remember him for the way he was. Rest in peace AGP you will NEVER be forgotten! 😭,0.9901,113
