"Ive used the clipboard routine before. The trick is to look annoyed and slightly angry that you have to be there. Look busy (cell phone), have a few things to say, like ""from the state"" we are all from the state! Never lie, always tell the truth, people can tell. Make sure the ""truths"" have multiple meanings. No vest needed, but clipboard and pen in hand. Ask where the GM is. Have a name ready. Incoherent paperwork on the clipboard, show them, they don't care, they don't understand. Use stamps (ink) on papers. wear gray colors, no hats, no sunglasses, just in case, you don't want to be easily found if a question arises. This will increase your chances.",0.7402,151
