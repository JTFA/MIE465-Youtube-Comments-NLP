I love your styling videos and I used to think you were lucky that you had found your own style, it seemed unattainable to me.

In this year, I also focused deeply on the relationship with myself for the first time in my life. I went through meditation, reading tons of self-help books, and tried hard to become a best version of myself. Now I feel hundred times better than when I first started. And I believe, I will become better and better each day. I was really surprised to see the person like you, who seems to have it all, looking extremely happy also had similar self-doubt and tried hard to better yourself. I am happy that we both progressed, and feeling more confident and happier than before. Cheer to us!",0.9917,152

I grew up without any role models that looked like me, and thought you had to look like what was portrayed in the mainstream media to be considered beautiful. It‚Äôs incredible to see someone who looks like we do become so successful and considered to be so beautiful on the inside and out. You have thousands of people who are proud of you, you just have to remember to be proud of yourself, because at the end of the day, that‚Äôs really all that matters.",0.9946,170

They empowered me through this most stressful year. Watching your monthly favorites has become something that I look forward to each month. -- Also, while there are outfits and makeup looks that I like more than the others throughout the year, I must stress again that I really like your Party For One lookbook.

But I love watching inspirational videos now because I am at a point in my life that I have all these goals and aspirations and I also feel stuck. I am fine not dating right now, but I always wanted really good friends. I never had them before, as I got out of high school they all pretty much dropped me or betrayed me in some way. So I think for 2018 that would be my first goal. To get out of my comfort zone and meet new people. Find people that are like minded and try to form lasting friendships. Thank you for sharing your wonderful video, and I hope your 2018 is just as, if not better than your 2017. Congratulations on all of your accomplishments.",0.9909,182

"Truly cryin in the club @ this one. Thank you for being so raw and open with your humanness. I remember in Amy's GRWM about negative emotions, it really stuck when you addressed seeming happy and positive all the time‚Äî because you film when those moments are happening. 

It'd be easy for someone to think you lead a shiny, perfect, surreal life, but it's a refreshing reminder that social media/youtube is only a glimpse at someone's world, and that you're perfectly human too. YOU üëèüèΩ ARE üëèüèΩ AMAZING üëèüèΩ KEEP IT UP BB",0.9672,108

"hey jenn! I hope you see this out of everything that's out here, but I just wanted to say you make so much content that makes me so teary and happy for you. you're probably the most eloquent fashion youtuber on here and one of the most relatable and genuine ones as well. you work so hard and really care about the people in your life, and you put so much effort into everything you do. 

it makes me feel so good when you're doing well and I'm really glad that you share your insecurities with us as well. it makes me feel really close to you and I relate bits and pieces of my own life so much to yours. it's really hopeful to see someone who struggles with personal worth constantly trying to improving themselves and maturing so well over time.. I'm so inspired by you and I just wanted to let you know how much of an impact you have on so many of your subscribers!!

I never write comments usually but I feel so compelled to ask you about so many things, I wish I could talk to you and know how you experienced everything, especially regarding relationships and friend circles. I too feel that I have always kind of floated around friend circles but never felt really apart of them or close individually to each person. I'm turning 23 this summer and sometimes I feel like my social life's potential is decreasing as time goes by. I've lost touch with so many friends I thought I'd feel connected to forever along the years, this past one in particular. how old were you when you found your circle and how did you meet them? is it truly just fate that brings you together or do you have any tips to find people you can really connect with?  I love you so much and I wish you the best always <3",0.9983,344
"hi jenn! i really love that bit when you said you can't compare your past to your present self; i never thought to extend this outlook to myself rather than to me compared to other people. i'm not of a typical demographic, if i can say so myself, because i did find you through your inspired tomboy look video from way back, but i'm glad i kept an open mind and saw how much your love for fashion and eventually vlogging has impacted me :) self-care has never felt so good, and watching new and old content from your channel is part of it.
i don't know what else to say but thank you!",0.9831,123
