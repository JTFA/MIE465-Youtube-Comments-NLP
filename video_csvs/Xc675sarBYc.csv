A quick tip don’t use the cat toys with feathers the kitten can eat the feathers when he gets more playful but everything else your ding great rasing him,0.8292,31
Aaaw! So sad! You did as well as you could I guess. Probably someone already may have mentioned it and I know you are very experienced with animals as well but kitten lady has so much info on orphaned kittens on her website. If you decide to foster more it might be a big help also to detect something like fading kitten syndrome early and help the kitten get back on his/her feet. Not saying you could have saved her I mean like I said I know you are very experienced with animals and sadly this happens sometimes as you said. Just wanted to put it out there anyway as a tip just in case 😊😊. The little guy is sooo adorable!,0.9622,133
"Alright I just want to say something. Take your fights somewhere else. A kitten has died! And yes, of course people are curious. But we can't just assume these things without actually viewing evidence or even looking at different assumptions. We always head straight to the worst thing we come up with. Fighting over the boyfriend won't bring the cat back. So let's just take a moment to say sorry for the poor kitten and then you can find on a less important video.",-0.8353,93

I was told the same that the kitten probably wouldn't make it but figured I would try anyways. after  having to leave the fd on three different occasions for an emergency vet visit, and literally not sleeping for a week I finally got to the point were I new he would be good.  Now he's a little assholes and turned into my grandmother's cat but that's a whole new story.  Anyways, like I said, one of the hardest things I've done, and credit to you and anyone else trying, that shit ain't easy!  Best of luck!",-0.7396,159

We did everything we could to make it comfortable & care for it but unfortunately it passed away that weekend. Even though it's been over 10 years now, this video really hit close to home & i just couldn't help feeling emotional. (We named the kitten Coffee btw & i'll always miss her <3)",0.7263,123

And then I walked home, my mom did not want another cat so she make me keep him in my garage after about 1 hour that I was outside with him NEVER came in once she let me bring him in.

I feel like it was very risky to bring in kittens covered in fleas into a place with two adult dogs. I also feel as if you will not spend time with your other animals as you spend more time with small pets than your dogs and judging how much you are with your cat you’re probably neglecting them because they’re caged up all day,-0.3167,70

My mom and my brother were up at 3:00am every night and changed shifts every day to feed her, help her go to the bathroom, and make sure she was doing okay. My mom even made a bed for her in her office with an old office cardboard box. She had a heat pad and a blanket and a rolled up sock that we would warm up. She only had a sock for a mother. Now she is the fattest cat I know and the cutest! So I am affirming what you said Taylor...it is SO hard to take care of kittens, especially if they are newborn or only a few weeks old.

when i rescued my kitten she was in the worst pain possible. i was in 7th grade at the time and was told by the vet she wouldn’t make it 3 days. she was about a month old and was super underweight. i bottle fed her every 2-3 hours and eventualllt she got better. going through that was so hard especially since i was so young. now i’m 16 and i have my little princess!! she’s really fat and cuddly now and i’m so blessed she lived because of me,0.7851,105
