Hi Jesse! I am very glad to hear that. Thanks a lot for your feedback. One thing that helped me enormously is meditation.  I am meditating since five years everyday and it was the best decision I have ever taken. The other day I wrote a list for a friend. I thought I would copy- paste it to you. If you aren't interested, feel free to ignore the list above. Best wishes :- )

1.  You can google the "" Harvard meditation study"" if you wish. They 
have found out that even after 8 weeks, meditating 25 minutes a day 
makes a change in your brain that is visible in your brain scan. 

2. You can watch a lesson by Yale University on youtube about 
Mindfulness. In order to find it just search for this: 

""Yale, Mindfulness, Human Emotion""

( Just 20 minutes )


3. The professor on that lesson recommends these guided meditation 
podcasts that I am using since 5 years now. 

To find them search in Itunes for: 

"" UCLA Hammer Meditation"": 

Then download the episode:

"" Using meditation anchor""   

You can download other episodes too, like:

Back to Basics
Deepen your concentration

Then  you must do it everyday. You can do the same episode or try 
different ones. The teacher, Diana Winston is wonderful!  

Just do it everyday. In a couple of weeks, you will feel the difference.
 The time you put in it will come back to you as more serenity, clarity 
of mind and compassion for yourself and for others. 

I hope you really do it. 

4. And the best book I know about meditation is this:

"" Mindfulness, Finding Pease in a frenetic world"" by Mark Williams, who is a psychology professor at Oxford University.  

If you wish you can download the mp3's from this book online for free. I especially like the one called "" Three minute meditation"" and the "" body scan"".",0.9898,377

"Dear friends who feel disappointed by this video, saying that they tell us what to do, but not HOW to do it,
Of course I understand what you mean, but here is good news for all of us: indeed they did make a lot of videos about how to parent ourselves. I grew up with a totally hysterical, violent and lunatic mother and I have found  guidance on so many videos of this channel. Here are just a few examples: 

1. If you come from a troubled home, like most of us do, you probably are very harsh on yourself. Because it is hard NOT to see yourself from the eyes of that parent, who was always discontent.  That's why the first thing you will need is to cultivate a lot of compassion towards yourself.  So they do have a video called:

Self Compassion

You can complement it with the following three videos: 

The importance of Self Pity
Overcoming Bad Inner Voices
Love and Self Love


2. Growing up  without true appreciation, you will have a lot of insecurities, so you can find help in these videos:

Self Confidence
Self Esteem

3. You will have huge trouble feeling connected to others. Trust issues I mean... But they have a wonderful video on the "" Purpose of Friendship"".

 Another great reminder is :  ""Why old friends matter"". 

4. If your parent sees you as a hopeless case  and you don't know where to look at to find meaning, they have a video called: 

"" Finding your mission"". 

5. If you don't have a real role model in the family, or no one to give you guidance on what kind of work you could do, they have many videos about this. For example:

How to find meaningful work
How to find fulfilling work
Misemployment
Why You Still Have Time To Change Career

( I would definitely watch the excellent documentary "" Status Anxiety"" by Alain too.)

6. You most probably will have a lot of trouble around finding a partner who isn't abusive or isn't similar to your parents. They have a video on John Bowlby, where they explain his attachment theory. 

And they have all sorts of videos about all sorts of relationship troubles too...


7. For your dark moments related to the past, they have videos that offer you a lot of valuable insights. For example: 

Insomnia
The Sanity of Madness
Self Sabotage

8. You probably will have a lot of difficulties, finding an access to your inner world and then making sense of what you see there. So here is my favourite video about it: 

Philosophical Meditation

And of course: 

Resilience in Hard Times

9. Depending on how severe the trauma is, your thoughts may get too dark at some point. These three videos may help:

On Feeling Depressed
Suicide
The Origins of Suicide


10. If you consider seeing a therapist, but don't know how that is supposed to work, here are the videos I liked a lot: 

What is psychotherapy and why you should try it?
Psychotherapy
Panic Attacks ( this is a terribly interesting therapy story.)

"I grew up with a covert-malignant narcissistic mother, a father who I had only met once, and a step-father her half the time ignored my existence and the other half loathing it.  I grew up having to parent myself while being brainwashed to believe that what my mother was doing was actually parenting and that I should be grateful for what I get- despite the mind games my mother played with me and the toxic household I lived in.  Sad thing is, I didn‚Äôt realize that what I was living through was even abuse until I got sick and my mother volunteered to be my ‚Äúcaretaker‚Äù- yet, I still had to take care of myself even when I couldn‚Äôt (my Mom would let me pass out with my face in my dinner plate and wake up with food all in my hair or not bother to check on my when I would fall on my face, literally, after passing out standing up).. And combine that with the belief I have that she isn‚Äôt even my real birth mother, though my aunt being so (who apparently had two abortions in her life and then paid thousands to be artificially inseminated with sperm from a hi IQ donor so she could have a ‚Äúgifted‚Äù child.  From a woman who tried to gaslight me by saying she couldn‚Äôt be around me because I was a drug addict and alcoholic - yet, I had never drank anything harder than wine around her; that she would let me mix spritzers with since the age of 9, never been drunk around and had even kept my medicinal marijuana smoking away from her- and I was one ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs in your DNA‚Äù).. Hell, I‚Äôve only had my mom, aunt and grandma in my life and two out of the three won‚Äôt talk to me because I won‚Äôt buy into their lies and bullshit.

So, not only have I had to self-parent, I‚Äôve had to self-family.  Most of us have grown up in fucked up homes, though, at least they weren‚Äôt surrounded by malicious intent and sabotage.  However, I do belief that there is quite the epidemic of narcissistic behaviors bred into our society, since the end of WWII- and that‚Äôs why so many have had to grow up basically parenting themselves, in some form or another.

So now when you make a mistake now and start with 'you idiot etc' you stop, give yourself a hug and say whatever you needed as a child. eg 'It's not so serious, everyone makes mistakes, don't worry, I' ll help you' and soothe yourself. Later you can think calmly about learning from the mistake. Ditto any stressful or negative emotions. With flashbacks or painful memories you can literally intervene in the memory as yourself now, acting as the parent you needed and deserved with the information your parents' failures gave you.

He wouldn't admit that he has problems. At the same time I totally understand it's because he's just too scared to admit that he's different. He would tell me those old beliefs that I'm not aware of my tantrum because I'm crazy. God will not note and record my sin for that reason etc. 

But he himself still acts like I used to act in social when I was an early teenager. He still likes being the clown of the group because he doesn't know how to deal with and express his emotions properly. I feel there a lot I can share with him from my own journey and as the result of his flawed parenting, but I know he wouldn't listen because he just wants to feel adequate. But he is better at a lot of things, he can keep his sense of comfort enough to enable him to socialize and work.

"RE-PARENTING THE SELF. Here‚Äôs an excellent short presentation on changing the ‚Äútemplate‚Äù of our self-understanding. 

We have in ourselves, not one, but two selves. What Freud called the ‚Äúsuper-ego‚Äù-to our ego, others, like Adam Smith (Theory of Moral Sentiments), had different titles for. This ‚Äòhigher self‚Äô concept is that unmistakable inner voice of authority on the kind of person we are‚Ä¶or, could become. For Smith, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúimpartial observer‚Äù of our ego‚Äôs thoughts, words and actions. Becoming aware of and altering the self-destructive impressions from this ‚Äòhigher (parental) self‚Äô, is to ‚Äúre-parent‚Äù the self; to go from just criticism of bad parenting (which goes nowhere) to making a creative project out of learning to recognize and change the details of entrenched and harmful patterns from our formative years.",0.3919,173

"The best way I've found to reparent myself is to focus on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  I remind myself that I always deserve the best quality physical inputs of nutritious food, water, air, warmth, light, and information, and access to welcoming outlets for expressing my physical outputs of my body's solids, liquids, gases, and energy, all unconditionally.  And then I look to remembering that I also need the more lofty goals of being loved by at least one other who collaborates with me on achieving our shared goals.  And then I make sure to support all my goals for finding a larger community to also collectively work towards improving life for everyone, in some kind of creative adventure.  

Even if I can't actually get these things, being a good parent, to anyone, means being aware of these needs, and speaking up about them whenever they are not being met, so that we can focus our efforts on attaining them, rather than giving up.",0.9896,185

If you're interested in reparenting there is a field you should definitely know about. It's one of the most important I've ever learned. It involves reparenting and inner child aspects, but even goes far beyond those. And it offers very specific techniques for how to apply it in addition to the insight it offers. I have gained a great deal from it and help a lot of people I work with to heal and develop using it.

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
