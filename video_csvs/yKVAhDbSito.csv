"1- Self Control: Looks really bad without gloss
2- Problematic: Patchy like the berry shades in Holiday collection
3- Restraints: Too sheer and patchy

Jeffree should stick to his formula that has proven to work. Holiday collection was great (minus the patchy berry shades. WHY?). He should restock his lips with his best formula instead of pushing out new shades that are questionable.",0.912,76
