"70% of India does live in rural areas and Indian food is spicy compared to a typical white American diet. And yeah, the white girl is clueless about Indian customs because she's been fed stereotypes about how ""exotic"" it is but obviously the movie is showing that she's ignorant for thinking that. And the Indians obviously think she's ignorant about her own profession (rice cultivation) which shows they definitely are not ""worshiping"" this white girl. It is a cliche rom com movie? Sure. Is it insulting? I'm not really seeing how it is.",-0.5588,108
"A romantic movie based in India between a white woman and an Indian man.......I think that's the issue y'all have and try to mask it by claiming the script is shit. Its a Romance movie.....A typical Romance movie. 

Westerners learn how to genetically modify rice(Which is an important export for India and it's farmers to live) and send a white uncultured woman over and while there she learns and respects another culture, helps them overthrow her peoples and even falls in love with a man she probably wouldn't have considered back in USA.......................

What's the issue again?",0.9451,109
"Ami Mistry thank you for giving your perspective, I really do appreciate it. I am not able to relate to your struggles but I empathize dearly. I believe that this is a real problem and I am very sorry for what you have been through. I respect your maturity toward this kind of thing, from what I’ve seen you’re very intelligent. I wish for victims to speak up and change the way that the Indian people, (and other people of culture) have been portrayed. People like you and I can work together to make this world a better place (:",0.9749,114

"Speaking as an Indian, this is kind of annoying, to see all these stereotypes for India. I belive the rural type is gine, as long it doesn't go to the extent living in *huts* . I've been thought to live in a hut too, I'm not even exaggerating.",-0.3559,56
"Thanks for your input! And yeah, cinema does have a habit of only pointing out the things that seem distinct and unlike the culture of the target audience. And your right, not all Indian food is spicy. Gulab Jammun is one of the sweetest desserts I've ever had and idli is about as far away from spicy as it gets. Very solid point. But being a caucasian American who lived in India for a short while, I can say that I had very similar experiences that this woman had where I (probably a bit too frequently) bit into food to find that it was so spicy that I spent the next 5 minutes going down on some curd. And yeah, I really wish more western films would show the diversity of Indian lifestyles and not just show the rural lifestyle (although those people are important and their stories and lifestyles ought to be shown too). When it comes to all of the people who didn't understand your culture and ridiculed you for it, I am sincerely sorry about that. It's wrong that you had to go through that. I am glad though that you were there to show these people diversity and hopefully if these people come across more people who come from diverse backgrounds they won't believe the generalized pictures that media portrays of different countries. And when it comes to cultural appropriation, I think America just has a hard time with it for a multitude of reasons. I think it's mainly that people who have differing cultures are typically either ostracized or exotizied(spelling?). They either are seen as being weird or they are seen as hip & trendy and so very different that you can just go and take from them. What I wish was the case, was that these cultures were embraced but not seen as exotic. That if you wanted to invite your friend to wear a bindi or a sari they could gladly accept because they don't think it's some weird thing that only people of a particular race can wear but they also don't think it's something that they ""discovered"" without giving due credit and respect to the culture where is comes from. In the end I guess I would say that I don't think the movie is insulting, but it is one of the many movies that portray the same old singular view of India and the fact that the movie industry refuses to show this other advanced side of India is very insulting and we as viewers should insist on them producing different kind of movies.",0.8574,468

"This is a movie about how a white company is trying to destroy India and then the community unites together with one of the employees (a white woman) and a leader within the community (an Indian man) to fight back. As far as I can tell this movie isn't promoting the white savior complex, it's showing how crappy western companies are and saying that India can fight against them. Did I read this trailer wrong? Not trying to start a fight, I just really don't understand why Indians are saying that it's disrespectful or insulting.",-0.9695,105

"Yes, India is very rural I agree and the rural areas are still very ignorant and backwards.  But I have yet to see a movie where they actually display the other 30% urban area.  Highly modern, educated and upwardly rising middle class.  The workforce that produces scientists who was the first nation to complete the Mars Orbiter mission successfully, of a movie industry that produces the most movies in the world, of a highly successful and admired Prime Minister and top notch engineers and IT professionals. They fail to show the fashion industry, which produced stars of international fame like Priyanka Chopra or Freida Pinto, or Miss Universe 1994/2000.  It's cliched because they show that Indians are not capable of handling our own problems, thus the 'white savior' has to come save us.  A lot of Indian food is not 'spicy' and if it is it's because we of an overall tropical climate and a very successful spice trade centuries ago. Thus we added new spices from other countries to our diet (like saffron).  A lot of Indian dishes have elements of sweet, sweet-sour and even bitter.  There are some dishes where I hardly put spice! Besides, spices are no shown to have many health benefits. When I mentioned the cliches it's from the overall experience I have seen of Western portrayals of Indian culture, and this movie does have some of those.   There have been a lot of debates lately about cultural appropriation.  And I seem to come across a common theme- that some people say ""oh chill out, I don't see how that's offensive"".  Well, unless you are a person of culture you will NEVER understand how cultural appropriation and stereotypes can be offensive.    You will never understand getting taunted all throughout my school years for ""mom wearing a dot on her head, hahahaha"" to a few years later Claire's selling these 'dots' because Madonna or Gwen Stefani wore one.  So now it's cool, but when other Indian women wore it we get ridiculed.  Our food gets insulted and considered 'dirty' but all of the sudden tumeric is the new rage.   There is 'beer yoga'  when it Yoga is very strict practice in which yogis have to be vegetarian and abstain from alcohol.   Now when someone sees this movie they will assume most Indians are like those characters shown in the movie.  It comes down to my work (i'm an occupational therapist) and I get questions of ""why my English is so good"" or ""did I get an arranged marriage"".  My parents (both urban and educated) have been here for 42 years so obviously my English is good and no I met my husband on my own.  I'm not saying don't appreciate my culture.  I've met a lot of Caucasians who beautifully appreciate NOT appropriate my culture.  And others who respect my heritage.  But one doesn't easily overcome past hatred.  I mean, a few years ago I had to file a compliant for a former manager for racist remarks, day before yesterday a patient asked me ""where's your bow and arrow"" and others ask ""are you an illegal immigrant"" So it really never ends.  And I don't live in podunk America either.",0.4519,608
