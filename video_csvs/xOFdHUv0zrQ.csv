Dat Grown Boi he is IRISH .  Many an interview he calls himself Irish.   Why?  Because anyone born on the island of Ireland is just that; Irish.  Have a read of the good Friday agreement.   Do a little research on the over 40% of people who live in the 6 counties who don't consider themselves British.   Do a little research on the growing Catholic population in the 6 counties which will eventually outnumber unionists. Do a little research on how Irish people were treated like second class citizens in THEIR own country when British colonialists invaders stole their land .  Do a little research on the provential kings and queens of Ireland and the high kings of Ireland and the rule of law ; Brehon Law.

Dear Friends Jesus Christ has a perfect plan for your life. NEVER FORGET THAT! But it is up to you to let Him work in your life. He won't force you. He must always be invited. It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your active pursuit of Him more than anything else in your life. He desires first place - not second and in doing so NO ONE to Him is more desirable than YOU! He so eagerly desires you to come to that realization dear one. He truly does. This is your starting point with our loving Creator that will last for all eternity. May God bless you in the MIGHTY name of Jesus Christ our Savior. John 3:16 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,0.9835,150

"So true...It took such a long time for Leonardo to win an Academy Award but you just can't say that he wasn't great & deserving. Sometimes it just takes the perfect timing and the perfect role/script to win such an award. You cannot judge someone's skills based solely on it. Also, I would agree that Eddie's role was kinda an Oscar bait...I mean he was no doubt absolutely incredible in the movie but it all depends on what you get. Jamie's movie career, in all honesty, has just begun, after gaining popularity from Fifty Shades and he's just starting to get great movie roles. A day will definitely come when hopefully people will forget and not judge him & his acting capabilities based on just one role because even after showing incredible performance in projects like The Fall, The Siege of Jadotville etc. people tend to completely ignore them and talk about him as if Fifty Shades is all he's ever done and all he'll ever do.
