"Glennis Grace is only woman that could do Whitney's songs justice. CA is force to strain her voice on Whitney's high notes. We all appreciated CA's effort, but honestly not the level of performance we all were expecting",0.8462,41

I love Christina but Sohyang would've done it better.,0.7543,10
I love you Christina but this was mediocre at best,0.8555,10
"I made a status on Facebook about this, why didn't the staff at the ama's insist on deborah cox? She is currently headlining the bodyguard on Broadway... she was also very close to her, also christina what do you mean make a dream come true? You did run to you for whitney when she was a live back in 2001 at the bet awards.... and you did another tribute on the voice.... you even sang I have nothing on TV when you were on the mickey mouse club.... did you forget?",0.533,100
I was really looking forward to this. I taped it and watched it tonight. absolute worst butcher job ever. Whitney had to be rolling over in her grave. she started the second song and I had to turn it off and just erase it. and another thing what the f*** happened to you. it looked like Fiona from Shrek up there singing. worst tribute ever in the history of music.,-0.8519,81
It was a fabulous tribute!  Kudos to you Ms. Aguilera!!!,0.8346,15
It was something. That wasn't her best performance. Not even close. What the world did she do to her face? Idky celebs don't get all that plastic surgery just makes them look worse. A bloated plastic version of themselves. Smh,-0.8302,46
J Smith86 who the fuck are you ugly ass!?? A No one!! Just an ugly ass bitch NOBODY looking for attention. Shove a branch filled with thorns up your dirty ass.,-0.9803,39
Lol @ the Screamtina Cowguilera fans. The tribute was shaky AF lol. She didn even feel the song. Just did what she always does and screams over the damn song. She doesn't even hold a fucking dimmly lit candle to Whitney anyways. Wanna see someone actually sing her song with Passion? Look up Jessie J's recent performance on the China singing show. Now THAT'S how you sing a Whitney song.,0.4215,78

"Pink's expression spoke for all us!!! Maybe had Christina spent less time getting Botox and fillers & more time rehearsing Whitney's material, maybe Xtina wouldn't have sounded like üí©",-0.4563,33
