"For those who read this comment, Jesus Christ Loves you and knows what you're going through.
Life is hard, and He personally knows all about it. 

He died and rose again for you to live for eternity. Believe in Him, and His Love for you.

If you were to fully know what He has saved you from, you'd be living every day for Him. He is coming VERY soon, sooner than you think. 

Call on Him and be saved! Repent of your sins, turn to The Lord, for He is our salvation! He will forgive you of all sin if you sincerely seek and trust Him. 

In that day, when we are finally with Him, there will be no more tears or death, just peace and happiness. 

*Romans 10:9*

*That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.*",0.8088,185

I can write this on every single Hunter Hayes music video.
He is SO MUCH better than the other trending artists these days.
Idk where the world is going.
Trap music is what's climbing charts these days, whereas beautiful songs like this are never really seen on them.
I can never understand why Hunter's song ""Still Fallin'"" never got a spot on the charts.
All I know is that it is THE BEST song I have ever heard.",0.8864,92
So sweet!! Melts my heart!,0.6333,8
"So when is this supposed to take place.  Some time in the early 50's.  It would be pretty rare to see a mixed racial couple back then.  I don't ever recall seeing that in the 60's here in Wisconsin.  I know about the Loving case in Virginia in the late 60's. That was when mixed marriages were against the law in  some states. I think the first time I saw mixed couples was when I was stationed in Germany from 1971 to 1973.   I didn't give it much thought, but considering it was only 25 years after WW2 have to wonder what older Germans thought about it.",0.5499,122

Wait is anyone going to talk about how that old dude hired the woman after seeing a pic of himself and his wife??? I don't get it. It seems like the man responds positively to the woman's attempt to flatter him. So any picture that contains himself and his spouse is automatically considered great while pictures of the woman's daughter and other couples are not? Doesn't it paint him as a superficial and shallow character? Are we suppose to hate him?,0.8253,89

"You're exactly right! Except, the last painting won't be of hunter playing the guitar. It's going to be of the redhead that bruce and his girlfriend dropped off at the party. The one that instantly fell in love with the guy playing the guitar for the band. So I assume the picture from the Rescue Music Video is actually the guy from the band romantically teaching her how to play because the girl in the painting is a red head as well as the girl in the video. Which makes sense because then it would tie into being 3 love stories.",0.9738,108

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
