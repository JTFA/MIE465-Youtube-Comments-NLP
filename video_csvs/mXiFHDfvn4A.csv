"1,2,

Moon river wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday (someday, day)
A dream maker (maker, maker)
My heartbreaker (you heartbreaker)
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (the same, the same)

Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasin' after all the same
Chasing after our rainbow's end

Moon river wider than a mile
Crossin' in style someday
My dream maker
Heartbreaker
Wherever you're going I'm going the same

Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see (What I see, who I become)
What I see, who I become
We're all chasin' after our end
Chasin' after our ends

Life's just around the bend, my friend

I found this cover on the day after my grandad passed away. For some reason The song hit me. It was on repeat my whole 8 hour drive home from my grandads funeral. As I listened to the song I was going through some old pictures of my gramps that my grandmother gave me. Looking at my grandparents young and full of life just got me emotional. These memories are attached to this song for me since. Guys if you still have your grandparents do me a favor and show them your love and appreciation for them because you never know how much longer you’ll have them with you. Thanks.,0.9042,120
