James Cordon:2018",-0.3867,16
#FAKE,0.0,1
"- At 54 years old, I am a native New Yorker, born and raised, and I have ridden the subways for 1-2 hours per day nearly all of my adult life, and a good chunk of my life as a kid since I got my first job at 12 years old. That's literally close to 15,000 hours on the subway.  
-- Outward belligerence and verbal challenging of performers by telling them to shut up, I have *NEVER* ever personally seen.
-- Now, we New Yorkers, 'tis true, can be an ornery bunch from time to time, and satire like this could have worked if it wasn't so unoriginal and reliant on stereotypes and tropes (sassy black woman, crotchety old folks) that lack any semblance of humanity.  
-- What's more, in so many ways, the skit fails to relate how New Yorkers generally treat people who sing on the subway.  Folks don't often tip -- that part is true.  In reality though, the spectrum of reactions usually range from the common decorum of listening politely, to blocking out what we hear, to (on rare occasion) singing along, to clapping when a performance is great.  Each of those reactions could be mined for comedy. Instead, this skit, lazily written, beat a one-trick pony to death. Usually, I love James Corden's humor, but this skit? Uninspired. A fail.",0.4464,269

"ricky simmons like I'm not trying to insult him he's clearly very talented but it almost feels like as a british comedian running an LA late night talk show he forces it a lot in bits.  I'm sure everyone's trying too hard but his shows more.  Like when they do the riff offs and he starts randomly saying how great 90s jams like this is how you do it is, it's very clear he's leading to a riff off but I don't genuinely believe he cares about this is how you do it",0.9884,96

"trkk01  holy shit guys, really?? If it was 100% accurate, it wouldn't be (or attempting to be) funny! Do you really not have an understanding of how comedy works? üòÇ ""a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar. They say hello, have a drink, and leave."" <-- is that how you tell a joke?? No. You take a realistic scenario and exaggerate it in a way that's both familiar and over-the-top enough to be funny.  How funny would it be if it actually just showed people ignoring them and pretending to be sleeping when they come near them?",0.7142,120

"uppermostking02 I understand that you need a permit, but be realistic; are they really stupid enough to do that? My second point still stands. Being a New Yorker, and one that has performed in the subway,  I think you could have instead suggested they sing on the platform, where no permit is necessary. Finally, of course I posted an idiotic comment... I‚Äôm Idiot McGee!",-0.9611,78
