"I agree Roberto.  From what I see going on in the youth leagues, we are way behind in training our coaches.  We have two problems here, we teach our coaches online and quickly.  In Europe, it can take 2 years and they learn in person.  I've learned this from coaches I've met while my son trained over there the last 2 years.  The other problem we have is that we look for players the way they look at players in American football, size and speed.  Who cares if the kid can't kick the ball properly or can control a passed ball, he/she is FAST!  Until our coaches in the youth leagues figure that out, we will never catch up.  My son is the victim of that thinking.  Yeah, he's tall and he's fast, but he's not fast enough.  Over in Spain and England, they loved him.  He plays the game exactly the way they wanted.  I've seriously considered sending him to live with a friend so he can train at a club in England.  He'll get a better shot.",0.9365,204

"La marca Hyundai se encuentra entre las mejores marcas japonesas importantes en el mundo y ha invertido 5 millones de dólares por 30 segundos en un comercial para la cadena NBC en la transmisión del Súper Bowl , con la intención de confundir e incidir en un Target importante de consumidores pretendiendo poner al deporte REY (FÚTBOL) como un deporte sin importancia. Los asesores de la marca han perdido el rumbo y se olvidaron que el FÚTBOL mal llamado “soccer” viene colocando en los últimos años proyectos para que al fin USA tenga participación en un MUNDIAL, donde se paraliza el planeta por 30 días y no un deporte local por 1 día. Realmente lejos de ser un comercial gracioso, es una campaña completamente descriminatoria .",-0.34,134

Roberto Ramirez I don't think that it is... hockey finds the same problem with popularity and America is pretty good it is just they aren't visually appealing sports.,0.7579,30
"Roberto Ramirez hey loser. Americans like football, basketball, and maybe baseball and we all collectively think soccer is a wussy sport and are not proud that you world people make us play it.  Here's why:
Football: Strongest in the world
Basketball: Tallest in the world
Baseball: Hardest Hitting in the world
Soccer: 150 lb Pansies running around for an hour with a volleyball.  Suuuuuuucks",0.2134,74
Roberto Ramirez that's what I'm saying they are similar sports it's just America is good at hockey but they aren't visually appealing sports,0.2382,23
Sandy Mahoney America have a stupid vision for what soccer should be. Even in a high school in America some players who have actual talent and know the game or chosen to bench for players who are a bit taller and cause they are fast to be starters. It’s really a bad habit. I don’t think America will ever change.,-0.5256,68

"breathless n6u5r6x2 I doubt that. It’s just that we ain’t as good as the Europeans or even South American countries.

"gkornegay you are so fucking stupid. Stop making yourself look like an idiot by giving dumb reason for football, basketball and baseball. When does being strong or being tall have to do with being a better sport you fucking idiot? You don’t give a good reason to backup your stupid comment. “We” since when does one idiot of America talk for all? Soccer is more demanding than any sport. It requires you to be in tip top shape not just being tall or being on the juice or even be some overweight defender in an American football team. Soccer is a sport where talent actually matters. Not taking away credits from basketball or baseball. But American Football can’t even compete with real football (soccer)",-0.8533,142
