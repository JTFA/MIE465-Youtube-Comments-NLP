She work out, so why not show your body off. And y'all keep saying ""she's not inspiring other girls by showing off her boobs"" like OKAY some girls don't like their big boobs and she can be inspiring those to love and be comfortable in their boobs. And I don't understand why you people always think EVERY celebrity is obligated to ""inspire"" young girls. Let her flaunt her body. She young and bomb af. Let her live in the fucking moment.
