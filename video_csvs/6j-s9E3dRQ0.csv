"hey dear teenagers, high school popularity thing always branding by these kind of movies or tv shows. Even if their message is against it. My high school years were quiet fun. But in 13-15 i was bullied kid,  i was thinking about suicide too. Like too many teenage people. I am 22 right now. When you start to grow up, you all will understand that everything is in your mind. Your parents are actually cool, your worst enemies are too. In this path you'll loose friends but don't worry you'll have better friends when you are in twenties. So you think we are living  in now, but no. We living in past, now and future. Always think about when you feel that way. Just think you'll be nice and safe and you'll talk about these events with laughs. I love you all, please have a nice life.",0.9866,168
