"[Verse 1: Noah Cyrus]
It's three o'clock in the morning
No one can make me go home
'Cause no one's waiting there for me
And I just can't be alone
Your green eyes are a weapon
Shot a hole in my heart
Now I'm falling for the bad one
And I'm seeing stars

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, oh
Every time you pull it backwards
I'm just gonna fall in faster
'Cause I don't wanna go slow, oh

[Verse 2: Noah Cyrus]
No one likes being honest, but I'mma give you that
So ask me how much I want you, and I'mma whisper back
How many other girls you know
Say it ""all up front, I'll take care of you""
'Cause now I fell for the bad one, and it never lasts

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
So I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, oh
Every time you pull it backwards
I'm just gonna fall in faster
'Cause I don't wanna go slow, oh

[Bridge: Noah Cyrus]
I don't wanna-
I don't wanna-
No I dont wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go, no

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, (I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go) oh
Every time you pull it backwards
I'm just gonna fall in faster
'Cause I don't wanna go slow, oh

[Outro: Noah Cyrus]
I don't wanna-
I don't wanna go slow
I don't wanna-",-0.7981,310
