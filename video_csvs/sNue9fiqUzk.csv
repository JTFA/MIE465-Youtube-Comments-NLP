"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends!
Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

Jesus LOVES you, friends!

He is not angry at you, and He does NOT hate you.

The Lord came down from heaven to die and rise again for all of us. This is SHEER Love, to die on behalf of someone else.
So don't let the devil scare you from seeking Jesus today! YOU WILL BE SAVED WHEN YOU CALL UPON HIM!

The Word Promises!
Jesus also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him.

You don't need a fancy prayer, just speak from your heart. Ask Him to help you in whatever you are going through. 
He will listen, I assure you. You don't need a lot of faith, a mustard seed size is sufficient.

The Lord will also make a Way to escape the oncoming judgement headed to this earth; He made a Way by His Body on the cross for us!
Thank you, Jesus!

So friends, I pray you make today the day you make Jesus your Lord and Savior! You won't regret ever.
Shalom!",0.9902,216
