The suggestion that it's 'the most amazing thing you'll ever do' is not only irresponsible, but it's also incredibly hurtful to people who don't have children for whatever reason.

Of course, parenthood is not for everyone, but this video raises the question ""What is a good Life?""  Children have heartbeats, devices do not.",0.3833,82
"I thoroughly enjoyed this video and it’s message. I worked and studied early childhood education before having my own kids and was always inspired in that field by how we can improve education from the earliest stages of life in order to create future generations of humans who essentially care about the future of the planet, care about each other and know how to care for themselves. Of course I couldn’t wait to have children of my own to experience how the role of a parent compared to the role of an educator, and how I could raise humans that will hopefully be an asset to the world. Not everyone becomes a parent for those reasons, which is why I thoroughly support planned parenting. I also totally support people who choose not to raise children. If you don’t see the appeal of having children then for gods sake DON’T have them. Because while ‘making them’ might be easy enough (for some) raising them sure as hell isn’t. I expected to find parenting a breeze after working with children for so many years and yet I have struggled daily with feelings of unworthiness, inadequacy and fear of failure. It doesn’t help me, that in most philosophy circles (the previous comments are exemplary) that ‘family’, ‘parenthood’, and ‘pregnancy’ are seen as dirty words and a kind of travesty to any forward thinking person. So many of you are assuming that one can’t be a parent AND be a kind of success in your own right. I challenge this! Since having my children I’m more determined than ever to read, to continue studying, to learn new things, to travel, to improve myself, because those all things that I ideally want my children to value. And children learn from observing the adults around them. It’s also a shame that increasingly more and more intelligent, educated and just plain talented people are choosing NOT to have kids. We need more conscientious parents in the world! NOT (and I agree with many of you anti-natalists on this point) more people having children just because they ‘can’ or ‘should’...... it’s a HUGE commitment! It has HUGE consequences in your personal life and potentially on the world at large. But to be realistic if we all just stopped breeding, we may never cure cancer, or end world hunger or continue to advance humanity at all. And of course, to give a bit of fire back, if you are so against breeding and the ‘impact on the environment’ perhaps you should remove yourself from the picture. You can’t all possibly claim that you’ve ‘earned’ your right to life any more than my small children can. Any infant child could grow up to be the next Hitler or the next Newton, but I believe videos and texts like this one that remind parents of the huge achievement it is to raise a decent copy of yourself do a great service in inspiring us to do the best we can by our future generations.",0.9927,589
"I understand what they wanted to say,  that even when we think we don't have an influence we raise children and shape them,  and when you think about it,  thus is really amazing and I agree with that,  but still,  I don't that our all life should be all about children,  there are many other things we can do.",0.5312,66

Many are arguing that there are far more meaningful and productive things to do in life than having children to prove one's worth. Many are even accusing the video of encouraging patriarchal thinking. That's unfair. Yes, one's productivity or creativity can't be evaluated by his/her parenting skills and raising kids isn't the only accomplishment one can achieve,but the video doesn't state that. It's only telling that making the next generation to be able to think, imagine,judge and act in the right direction is one of the most meaningful and crucial task in itself and also one of the greatest way to contribute to the humanity, which is true. If you think about the whole humanity and it's future with a little bit generalising point of view, you will understand and like the video.

Well, what I understand from this is that there is a risk in this kind of production and people seem to feel very frustrated and bitter if their efforts don't result in what they expected.. She is a super intelligent and terribly interesting person. So if  only she knew that she would NOT have a single religious child, she would certainly choose a different, more fulfilling path for herself.

 For example she could have spent her entire life in Mecca, written books, given lectures, she could leave something behind now,  that she could call her own and be proud of. So depends on what you expect, building a family is a great risk to take. You never know really...

I still I loved this video though. It must be truly fascinating to take full responsibility of a totally defenceless, clueless human being and face the challenge of explaining him what this world is all about...I don't think I could. That's why I deeply admire the people who have the mental sanity, clarity and endurance to build a family. I am sure under the right circumstances, that can help you to become a truly loving, compassionate and generous human being. But of course there are other ways to get there too. 

Female friends who don't want children, you may like the book "" The Mother of All Questions"" by Rebecca Solnit. Especially if you come from a very strict society where you are always being attacked for not wanting to build a family, you may find good arguments and consolation in that book. 

Friends who have children, here is a little list that could be helpful: 

1. Here are two of the latest Robert de Niro movies that are excellent:

-  The Wizard of Lies ( Here De Niro plays Bernie Madoff! What a tragedy...)

-  Everybody is fine ( Don't get fooled by the title. Nobody is fine in that movie. But at least we get the chance to understand why... )

Both films are incredibly moving and they will give you a lot to think about what it means to be a good and a bad father...

2. The Spanish Philosopher Fernando Savater wrote a book to teach ethics to his 15 year old son Amador. It is called:
 ""Amador: In Which a Father Addresses His Son on Questions of Ethics-That Is, the Options and Values of Freedom-And Attempts to Show Him How to Have a Good Life""

3. ""Everyday Blessings: The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting"" is a book by Jon Kabat Zinn. He is a doctor himself and an excellent writer. And the nice thing is that he wrote the book together with his wife. This is from Wikipedia:

Jon Kabat- Zinn  is Professor of Medicine Emeritus and creator of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the Universoty of Massachusetts Medical School. He was a student of Buddhist teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh and Zen Master Seung Sahn and founding memener of Cambridge Zen Center. 

4. There is another book by Andrew Solomon, called ""Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity"". There is also a youtube channel dedicated to the book too. It really touched me deeply. Here I copied a part of the information:

""He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, or multiple severe disabilities; with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender. While each of these characteristics is potentially isolating, the experience of difference within families is universal, and Solomon documents triumphs of love over prejudice in every chapter.""

5. There is an excellent website called ""Brain Picking""s, by Maria Popova. She always recommends amazing books, not only for adults but also for children. It could give you good ideas about what to read to your kids. 

6.  ""Let me tell you a story"" by  the Argentinian psychotherapist  Jorge Bucay. This book first became famous in the poor neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires, among teenagers. They recommended it to their parents! Now it is being read all around the world. You could read it together with your teenage child and discuss about the stories.",0.9989,861

"Said as someone interested in having children, this is an absolutely awful video.
Children as a means to fill an existencial vacuum or sense of accomplishment is a terrible idea, and the way the video portrays children as mere objects or products for us to show our creativity is gross. 
It's also as non-inclusive as can be for non-stereotypical nuclear families, and kinda shitty all around to people who don't want to have kids.

"Steve Payne True but that's the thumbnail/title game these days. How many people would have clicked if they saw the current title? I suppose that's the issue: so many people clicked on the video expecting to hear something that would make them feel special (as is the case with most of this channel's videos) and instead (mis)heard ""You're not amazing unless you're a parent."" 

I guess I didn't interpret it that way because the massive amounts of dislikes armed me for the worst. Perhaps, if I hadn't seen that ratio, I would have had the same reaction as everyone else.",-0.8707,117
"THANK YOU! I truly respect people who don't want kids, but I'm tired of people telling me that having children is immoral and selfish. Sure, if writing books and making movies fullfils you, good for you. BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME. I love family, and a dead book is not the same thing as having a child who loves and admires you. Specially the people who claim it's FOR THE ENVIROMENT. Those people are the ones who hurt the enviroment more than anything. A simple two children family in Nigeria probably has a smaller carbon footprint than one of those ""woke"" childless americans. IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIROMENT SO MUCH, STOP CONSUMING SO MUCH. I also hate the ""the world is overcrowded"" people. Who's fault is that? Is it ours? Or is it the fault of Asia, where more than half of the world population lives? I don't think I should be punished for having kids, specially since I live in a low carbon emiting nation, with a very low population density, just because Pakistanis don't care about family planning, and have more children than they can afford.",-0.9755,219

You'll try to be the best version of yourself for they and you'll have a wonderful purpose in your life.

"The problem with most goals is we can lose focus and sight of them and their significance and that's a problem because lacking a goal makes you feel like you have no purpose and are thereby worthless, even the goals we accomplish will often be forgotten and moved on from and we feel somewhat empty of our former pursuits. That's the miracle of parenthood, Having children and raising them is a type of goal that you feel the impact of for your entire life and is thereby the most purposeful pursuit one can endure so long as we get it right and nothing terrible happens. This is why I want to become not just a daddy but a capable, strong and caring parent who can set a child to succeed in the same way that I will. Having such parenthood as a goal is a very beautiful thing because it doesn't just start with making a baby, and its gratification doesn't just end once a boy becomes a man. It's a shame that you guys got so much hate for the former title of the video because i think the message here is far greater than people realize. they just couldn't look past the title lmao.",0.9784,216

"This is a pro-creation propaganda video; compared to this I can watch ANY of the sex-oriented videos this channel has to offer. I don't consider something that often results as an unplanned event or, god forbid, unwanted intercourse to be all that 'amazing.' EVERY living thing can reproduce; it's no big achievement. A lot of suffering is created in the natural world through the blind, ignoble pursuit of reproduction.  I feel like this video appeals to the lowest common denominator of the populace who are otherwise mediocre or apathetic; contributing nothing of significance to the progressive development of the human race and instead consider replenishment of humans to be all they've achieved. Reproduction is the most SELFISH thing you, as an organism, can do, because you are effectively saying that the passing on of your genes is more important than, say, adopting an otherwise unwanted human, devoting your life to the bettering of humanity without the care of offspring getting in the way, attempting  to solve philosophical problems, etc. Having a child so that they can carry on humanities' ambitions is like a cop out way of passing the buck and saying, 'here, you take care of this.' Don't get me wrong, it's a necessary thing and for the people who parent right and raise phenomenally well-adjusted contributing to society offspring, THAT is an impressive effort. But the biological concepts of it are NOTHING to write home about; let's just remember to keep it in it's place as a mundane, inevitable life-cycle event that takes place with over 80% of the sexually mature sector of the human race.",-0.5645,303

"This really was a great episode. It portrayed parenthood with a certain romance. A lot of people my age (27, but within 2~3 years on each side) have decided they do not want to participate in parenthood, or reproduction. Parenthood sounds magical to me. Close friendship sounds enchanting. Traditional and gay marriage both sound similarly enchanting (though I'd only choose the former for myself). I have so much trouble with social things. I'm decent at history, good at jazz improvisation, okay at music synthesis, interested in economics, ethics, history, political theory and practice, and metaphysics. I simply have a lot of trouble properly interacting with people and forming meaningful relationships. Part of it is fear, part of it is bad childhood memory. Part of it is my own autistic social cognition. I should ask for help, and look for it, but maybe elsewhere ; L D  .................   : L  (",0.6151,179

"You have heard God LOVES you. But is it true and do you believe it? It most definitely is true. In fact, He loves you so much that for a time, He gave up what was most dearest to Him: His only Son (Jesus). Jesus offered His life as a payment for the punishment that we sinners deserve (there is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood). Jesus the Christ died in our place on a cross some 2000 years ago and then defeated death, rising on the third day. We can escape hell and receive heaven via God's free gift of forgiveness and eternal life. ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.""  

  Don't be deceived, trust in the Savior Jesus and follow Him. Jesus said ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life."" God's free gift to man is eternal life. We have all sinned (lied, stolen, lust, used God's name as a curse word etc...), so we are guilty of sin against God. First admit you are a sinner, then ask God to forgive you. Accept and believe what Jesus has done for you and start following Him. Find a good, Bible-believing, Christian Church where you will be encouraged to follow Jesus Christ. Then share the GOOD NEWS with others. ❤️❤️❤️ (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6-10; John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9834,336

It's not special, if your going to be as cocky as to think that your dna need to be spread further when you your self dont even have a good hold on life, what make your think you can bring a child into the world an give them a life that isn't shitty. I suppose it wont really matter how much money you and your government spend on supporting the most selfish act you can perform in life, because It is likely that those who kept their money saved value and were smart enough to see that sustaining life is difficult when the world can produce anymore food. The population and mentalities a maintenance of the un-maintainable never account for if there were less people i would be paid more, or if there were less people there would be less pollution, if there were less people I would have a higher chance of getting to university, if there were less people i could have gotten that raise. If you want a child have one.
