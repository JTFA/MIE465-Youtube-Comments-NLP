"First let me say R.I.P to your grandfather. My prayers to you and your family.
My grandpa is about to pass as well, no one in the family speaks to him or visits him because of the way he treated the family in the past. I recently felt like giving up on him due to his attitude and hatred for the family, constant complaints, and threats to his children and myself, I know it’s because of his rough past and his age, why he’s acting the way he is. This video makes me want to forget everything that happened in the past/ignore the current negativity and just stick by his side during his last moments. Thank you for this inspirational video, I needed it.",-0.5307,146

 Rest in Peace.💝",0.987,81

"I’m so so sorry for your lost annabelle :( i felt the sadness and pain. My grandfather just passed away too last dec 16. He didn’t even make it to his birthday, dec 19. It’s so painful to me because i grew up and spent my whole 17 years having only my grandfather because my parents are away to work and earn us a living, as well as my grandmother. He didn’t even make it to my 20th bday last jan 16. And I’m so in pain because 16 will never be the same for me again. My bdate will never be as happy again. I love him so much but i didnt get to tell him that in his last breath because i was having my exams while he was battling for his life at the hospital. I regret not taking the exams earlier, i didnt get to give him my last hug. I’m so sorry I have to comment this. I felt all the pain watching your video.
