"Skyline I'll explain this here - i start with canada and sometimes work south, always continental north america first, then i either do the caribbean or south america. For the caribbean i do the big countries (cuba haiti bahamas jamaica) then do dominica grenada barbados and dominican republic, then i do the 3 saints and the 2 ands. I then go to france, get europe (microstates too), i go france monaco spain portugal andorra, move on to benelux and the british isles, then iceland, the germanic countries, then scandinavia, all of eastern europe, and usually end with russia turkey cyprus. I then go to asia, type all 7 stan countries, then southeast asia, east asia (china and the eastern countries) then indonesia, THEN i do the middle east. I then go to africa, usually northeast and the sahara (short country names), then west africa, then the gulf of guinea (long names like equatorial guinea and sao tome), then i do all of southern africa and then the african island nations. At this point i should be at 183 countries, otherwise i missed something, but then i do oceania and I'm done usually.",0.0387,229
