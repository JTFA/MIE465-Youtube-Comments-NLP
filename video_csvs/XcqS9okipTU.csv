"We can't really judge what title would have fit best from the teaser, and you seem to have given up asking for names and titles, but I think TOO MUCH INFORMATION could also fit. For example how people may recognize you on the upcoming St Patrick's day.

Or Tom Scott changes the subtitle of Citation Needed to Too Little Information in the unlikely case the series continues due to a funding with newly discovered Bessemer steel process jokes. I can't even imagine how one could run out of Bessemer steel process jokes. Every single letter of it is funny in itself already.

If you have half an hour I'd watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsyhGHUEt-k, even though right at the begin Tom and Matt point to several other videos you could watch instead.
