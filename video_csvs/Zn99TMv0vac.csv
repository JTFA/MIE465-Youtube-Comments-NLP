"Truely some of the nicest, bravest and most heroic men and women you will ever meet. It all starts with the dispatcher, dedicated, caring concerned, well trained heroes who start the ball rolling when you need the best help as fast as a speeding bullet. Able to reach burning buildings and extricate those in harms way. Calmly and  with the assertiveness it takes to defuse a volitile situation and provide us with the safety we need in every event. They deserve all the accolades we can ply them with for all they do for us. A sure way to start is giving them the obedience and respect they earn on every shift. Love you all, dispatchers, policemen and women, firemen, the EMTs and Paramedics, Halo flight personnel, Sheriff deputies, etal. Thank you  for being the best of the best.",0.9945,158
