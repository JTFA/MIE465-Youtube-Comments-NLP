"Anxiety + Christmas celebrations (+planning said celebrations) + school summer holidays (meaning everywhere is packed and LOUD, and stuffy hot) means no matter how and what I plan for it, it ends up being the worst time of year, and I suppose a huge disappointment (both because I try to look forward to it then once it's here completely resent it, and the disappointment in myself/my effort to make it all work.) HOWEVER, I do hold the thought in my mind that at some point in my life, my Christmases will be more peaceful, and more ""me"" like. Starves off the disappointment/failure feeling.

"Christmas has always been one of the very worst times of year for me. So to hear someone tell me it's okay for once lifts a weight. The weight is always there, and it just gets unequivocally and unbearably heavy when everyone finds out I hate Christmas and immediately has to inform everyone that something is terribly wrong with me. This is the first year I've been off medications in 7 years and I'm trying so hard to just LEARN to cope, and then thanksgiving comes and I get sad, and Christmas comes and it's an unbelievable almost crippling depression. I'm trying to avoid medications again bc I know it's temporary. It just never feels temporary though. This is my first holiday season without medication or therapy and I don't know how to deal. That's an awesome thing, but I just can't help myself from worrying myself literally physically ill. So thank you, no one ever says it's okay. It's either avoided or called out for being wrong or dreadful to dislike such a time of year.",-0.9831,192
"Christmas has been hard for me for a while, which started because around Christmas time 2015 my Grandad was diagnosed with MND (a terminal muscle wasting illness) my best friend tried to commit suicide, and I ended up in a relationship that made me feel used and alone. All within a month. Every Christmas since then I haven't been able to get 'in to the spirit' of Christmas like I used to, and I felt broken. My family has always done the same thing every Christmas, it's our tradition to visit Grandparents and share presents and food. I don't think I've ever spent Christmas at my own house for the whole day. And since my Grandad was diagnosed little bits of the tradition died. But this year will be completely different, completely wrong. After 2 years of suffering my Grandad passed away, earlier this year. My Nan doesn't want anyone to visit, I don't think she even put decorations up this year. So instead everyone's coming to our house at some point in the day and Mum has to cook dinner and lunch, so I know she'll be a little stressed. It just feels wrong. We're going to see my Grear Gran early (my Grandads Mum - I still dont want to believe after 80 years she had to watch her son waste away) because she's getting ill and tired and can't handle the big family gathering this year. The friend who I helped after she tried to kill herself barely talks to me anymore. And I'm still with the boy who made me feel pathetic and used. Although I did muster the courage to put my feelings on the table and things have gotten better (I don't know if his debatable mental health can be blamed for his treatment of me or not but hey ho) On top of that, I'm trying to study for my A Levels and now doing very well. On the plus side I haven't felt like doing what my friend tried to do, for about a month...so I guess that's good. I feel like Christmas isn't Christmas any more. But I will definitely try to see it as more of a day off, and a time to pat myself on the back.

If anyone actually read to the end, have a round of applause üëè because I don't think I would have üòÖ Sorry for blabbering, when Jessie said about Claud's Mum, I felt I could talk about my loss and I just wanted to get that off my chest.

"From the very beginning of the video i knew Jessica was going to cry because it looked like she was fighting back tears the entire time. I can't say how refreshing and unique this video is because everyone ignores the pressure, sadness or whatever other negatives we ALL deal with at Christmas. This time of year I reflect on the year and hope to improve next year.  Christmas intensifies our feelings and because it's the end of the year it can be filled with regret because we feel like it's too late to fix things and because everyone else is ""jolly"" or in the ""Christmas Spirit"" it can make you feel sad that everyone else seems to be happier than you but reality is they can be hurting just as much but not show it and THAT'S what makes this video so genuine.",-0.7096,152

And if you don't like one therapist, it's very easy to move on to the next one, instead of spending weeks hunting for a provider whose office you can physically get to, waiting for an open appointment, and arguing with your insurance about coverage. Since it is online, there is also no geographic limitations; QueerAsCat is an American currently living in Japan. There are some therapists available for languages other than English.",-0.2123,222

"I‚Äôm doing SO much better this year, but I really felt like this last Christmas, and on my birthday. My birthday is in the summer and a bit over a year had passed since I had finally finished uni and I finished uni feeling totally broken and sick and just in despair. In the fall I got a job where I worked 10 hour days in an Amazon warehouse and went to rehearsals for a musical after and exhausted myself just so I could sleep. Once the music was over it was Christmas rush and I was working 55-60 hours a week. I had no friends and no one to talk to now that the musical was over and then I had to explain the state of my life to every member of my family at every Christmas party. The explaining to people when you have to answer ‚Äúwhat are you up to nowadays‚Äù is so hard. I quit amazon because it was so exhausting and emotionally awful, started tutoring and got so sick I was a total mess by the summer, because I couldn‚Äôt keep a sleep schedule now that I wasn‚Äôt beating my body and brain into submission by performing physical labour, commuting, and dancing in the music man all the time. I finally got a sleep study and had some actual affirmation that there WAS something wrong, and was taking sleeping pills and trying to get better by my birthday, but I still wasn‚Äôt okay. I was angry because it had taken six years for me to get answers. I was frustrated, and lonely, and living with my very frustrating parents, and I just didn‚Äôt feel like celebrating a year of my life I felt like had been totally wasted. I was supposed to have been getting better so I could go back to school in the fall but I couldn‚Äôt because I wasn‚Äôt better. I knew something was wrong and that it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I was so ready to be better and i was crawling out of my skin with boredom, loneliness, and frustration because I was unemployed and unemployable. I just felt like I couldn‚Äôt celebrate a year where nothing had changed. I wasn‚Äôt any closer to getting my life where it needed to be or at least just enjoying any of my life or not feeling awful all the time. 
To top it all off, my brother is a judgemental dickhead who comes home from his fancy job in New York City as a banker, judges me, tells me how to live my life and act and think, throws gifts at me like it makes it better, and then fucks off back to New York and barely ever talks to me otherwise. I‚Äôve accepted that I hate seeing him and when he comes home for Christmas it is just so painful for me. My extended family also likes to say awful offensive things to start fights and then singles me out when I tell them it‚Äôs not cool (like I‚Äôm starting a fight by asking them to stop but they‚Äôre not starting a fight by being racist/transphobic/etc.). Family just makes things hard when there‚Äôs a lot of conflict there. And when you feel like you should love people in your family and you feel like maybe you hate them, it sucks. Same with birthdays.
I absolutely love Christmas because of the music, the decorations, the spirit of giving and charity, the movies, the food, etc. But it‚Äôs just hard sometimes. And wanting to enjoy it and not being able to enjoy the parts that people tell you are ‚Äúthe really important parts‚Äù really sucks. Like, when I‚Äôm just trying to get through it by making everything sparkly and getting gifts and someone goes on about how ‚ÄúI should be focusing on my family and friends and what I‚Äôm grateful for and modern Christmas is so consumerist and blah blah‚Äù I‚Äôm like...okay eff off. Bite me. Lol. 
I‚Äôm doing a lot better right now, feeling better, I have a great job tutoring, and meeting new people who are very nice, supportive, and appreciative. But people aren‚Äôt always in that place and I think we need to be a bit kinder to them when their feelings don‚Äôt really match what someone thinks the holidays should be.",0.986,839

This video in particular was brilliant and it made me cry for all sorts of reasons, both good and bad, to do with family and isolation and mental health. 
So, yeah, thank you Jessica. Your channel and your family give me hope that I can build a good life for myself, not matter what happens.

"Thank you so much for this lovely video! people alway push to be happy during positive christmas. For me christmas used to be a very happy moment. Presents, doing fun stuff with friends and lots and lots of food. That changed a few years ago, when my best friends decided I wasn't usefull anymore, so christmas was very lonely for me. Besides that i was diagnosed with severe IBS, which meant i could go out easily for dinner anymore. People didn;t understand it though. I was so scared to be in pain, that I wanted to avoid going out for dinner. However, people started to complain to me that 'it wasn;t that bad' and 'I should act normal', so I went with them (big mistake). For the last 3 years my christmas is sick in bed with a hell lot of pain from food (and does negative feelings from being alone didn;t help either). This year i don't feel alone anymore. I'm doing fine. My IBS is still pretty bad, but less severe. people still complain, but I'm sick and tired of hearing it, so for once I'm going to stand up for myself.

"Thank you. I had a string of several horrible Christmases where someone was missing - either they‚Äôd passed on, or they were away from home and having a miserable time. Christmas was never the same for me after that, and I‚Äôve never since felt like celebrating. It‚Äôs nice to see someone who loves the holiday as much as you do taking the time to acknowledge how hard it can be, and sharing your own stories.

I also really struggle with this extended break in routine that always gets forced by Christmas - the way everything grinds to a halt and you can‚Äôt get anything administrative or work-related done, how hard it is to get medical appointments, and how crowded everything is here in London.

I‚Äôm Jewish, and recently I‚Äôve been taking comfort in celebrating Hanukkah. It falls around the same time, usually, but it has a different feel and message whilst still being a time of celebration. Find the light where you can, friends. The daylight will be back soon.",0.8247,200

After the trauma of that event, my narcolepsy symptoms became completely apparent and unmanageable. No one knew what was happening. I was in in-house nursing for Christmas. My parents were angry I did not come Christmas eve, even though I was unable to stay out of cataplexy. Christmas day, I couldn't make it after I fell on my face in a cataplectic drop attack. 1 yr later and I am still wheelchair bound even having diagnosis for what doctors thought could have killed me. Things changed. Not better, not worse, just a different kind of disabled. I can't wait to be better, and feel like a human again.

"The way You are talking about Your illness and struggling with it made me think a bit more about my future,to be honest. 

Tl;dr Just another example how great Jessica is,nothing more needs to be said.


Everyone can have their own view on their illness,some can cope with it,some find it very hard to do so.
Two years ago,it was April,when one night I suddenly felt worse,my heart was acting weird,it was like it was stopping its beat,like not working for,as I was feeling it,5 or more seconds and I was panicking and thinking it might stop for good. Then I went to a cardiologist,who sent me to hospital,they made some examinations and diagnosed me with nothing,which I am quite happy about (and on the other hand not ->),but still,to this day I don't feel very well. My lungs hurt sometimes,I feel crushing pressure in my head almost everyday,heart is acting weird and when it gets hotter I feel realy bad (and the other cardiologist said there's nothing wrong with my heart). I get tired easier,I am not exercising on PE lessons because it hurts my whole body and little efforts make me feel dizzy. (To be clear,I eat healthy,drink the right amout of water almost everyday)I don't really know where should I go to be honest,my family doctor told me there's nothing they can do or nowhere to send me to diagnose my weird symptoms. Sometimes I want to give up and just stay at home all the time. But enough about it.
All I want to say is that I believe that maybe one day I will manage to feel,finally,as I felt these 2 years ago,before I started getting so tired and sick.
Jessica,in the video You said,that You believed,that someday You will  not even get better but You'll be able to have Your own family and live happily. And to this day,even though You can still get Your limbs paralyzed,have problems with swallowing (which I have too,since I was like 12 y/o :c ) and other disabilities,You never gave up. And I don't want to either. You have a wonderful wife and life,You travel a lot,visited many places (I wish I did too and someday I will!),You are happy no matter what and that made me think a lot. The way You talk about these things makes me happy - no matter the weather I can still enjoy everything I do.
To sum up,I just learned that I don't have to wait or cure myself perfectly,to finish my school,pass A-levels and start taking T (aka testosterone. Still need to get my examinations for the diagnose - here's the lovely trans guy,haha) because I can achieve these things without worrying so much how the frick and when I will be able to ""find the ideal cure"" for my odd ailments (sickness?)
I want to thank You for being You and for those warm words You say. No one could ever make me think positive about the bad things that happend to me,that I can still appreciate that I have done well for these 2 years because I never gave up. Just a big thank You from the bottom of my little heart.",0.9882,657

"We do tend to pile up expectations for special events and holidays, and letting go of them can be tough. Doesn't matter if they come from yourself or from others. I think Jessica's way of thinking is really great: A special occasion is an opportunity to spoil yourself. I think that includes letting yourself feel however you feel. ""It's my party and I'll cry if I want to"" goes the song, it sometimes loops in my head when I'm sad on a ""happy day"". But I hope you can also find things you enjoy doing around Christmas and get some feelings of contentment as well!",0.9753,118
"What a beautiful gift you are to so many! Even tho I am one of those struggling, I do my best to always uplift others, be it family, friend or the very angry/grumpy postal worker who seems to hate the world. It lifts me up, even if just for a short bit. I am so glad you encourage others to do the same. We need more kindness in the world. My struggle is such a combo of health, dissatisfaction in myself and inability to succeed , to often times function and rarely measure up to my own ideals ....I often just give up simply for the lack of being tired of the battle. Christmas as you said is a marker but it's also so much self imposed pressure and so much more is expected ....I could go on and on, but ....I just try to do my best to not let myself and in the stead focus on putting that one foot in front of the other and busy myself with uplifting others on instagram and here when I can.",0.8252,198

"when you ended your story I thought of something - this story is also a message to all the people that if you are struggling, you are sad or you can't see the light, it will be okay in the end. like it is to you - you have a loving wife, an accepting family, you have managed all of your health issues etc. basically you are generally happy. and that's the most important message (from you and also from me) - IT WILL BE OKAY, my little friend
peace out!
p.s. I had a choice to go to a pub or to stay in my room and watch your videos. I chose to watch your videos. that much of an influence you have on me :D",0.9715,143
