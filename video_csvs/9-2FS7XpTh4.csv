@Kogut 2k it wasn’t an issue back then because you didn’t have teams running up and down the court like they are now. Teams back then ran their offense through bigs and there wasn’t a lot of ball movement and player movement....or small ball like it is in this era. Playing that many minutes now in the regular season is not ideal,0.2556,72
@Thunder Buddy one..all of those guys happen to be freaks of nature. 2 none of those guys have ever had Tom Thibodeau as their coach when means those coaches do a good job of trying not to run their star players into the ground. Thibs’ problem is that he expects all of his players to be like KG who is also a freak of nature. Unless he finds some androids or cyborgs that look and play like KG it will never happen,0.5106,88
