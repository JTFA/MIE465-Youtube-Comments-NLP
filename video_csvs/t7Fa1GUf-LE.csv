As a former soloist, voice teacher and vocal coach, I really understand the challenges presented physically when such a gorgeous musical piece needs special attention, which when attended to well, sends a musical arrow directly to the heart and soul of individuals listening! Very nice Lexi and kudos to those young Piano Guys who are ever working at spatter-painting the world with peace of heart through the sound of music, and inspiring others to also 'Light the World'!

"What I‚Äôve found over the years is that god has significant control over our lives ( if he exists), but maybe he didn‚Äôt want us to make images of him because it‚Äôs simply the law, or that it damages whatever religion you speak of (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) because it would spoil his art piece: our lives. Every little thing that we encountered (Like a school closing on the day of an important event, or suddenly meeting your loved one at the same place without intending to) and every little change in the timeline was created because he is conducting us all as instruments of an orchestra: all equal in purpose with leaders and in making a difference by adding wonderful solos (Perhaps I‚Äôm just a cellist who ends up in those kinds of wonderfully fascinating situations, so‚Äôs Steve in the regard of the solo work he makes in ThePianoGuys arrangements) and intense parts which interconnect in infinite patterns. 

           Powerfully enough, God‚Äôs symphony is so obscure. It is so flat and so perfect in our equality, we don‚Äôt even recognize it until we see importance of a convenient event. Miracles are a bending of the rules, with increased emphasis on a section, on a certain group of people with particular importance. If God wanted to paint an image of himself in this, he would create a loop of infinity out of the fact that WE are his image. He does not us wanting to make sense of his existence because what we still create based on his image is the average of ourselves. He is not the average of us, he IS humanity. Good work on that part.",0.9952,321
