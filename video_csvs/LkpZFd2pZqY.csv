Please, if I had a dog trapped in a burning house I'd be doing the same thing! That's a horrible thought to think that the pet you love is going to burn alive. That doesn't mean she would ever intend for Jack to risk his own life to save her dog. That was something JACK chose to do because HE saw how upset she was and felt like he'd be letting her down if he didn't try. That was his own flaw, especially when it came to Kate- he'd do literally anything to not disappoint her. And, while it's understandable that Kate would inevitably put that blame on herself given the circumstances, it's really pretty terrible for anyone else to be putting it on her.",0.4915,174

"I get why she blames herself, but I think it's really unfair to say that it was actually her fault. She was a terrified 17 year old girl calling out to her dog who was trapped inside their burning house! It's not as though she was begging for Jack to go back in- Jack took one look at how upset she was and HE made the decision to go back in, because he was determined to cut the family's losses as much as possible (and that includes the time he took grabbing all of the other family keepsakes he found as he made his way out with the dog as well). 

That's just the kind of person he was, but the truth of the matter is that, as heroic as it was, it was also reckless with his own life. He was so committed to saving as much as he could for his family that he didn't think enough about keeping safe the only thing that TRULY mattered to them: himself. And that was not on Kate.",-0.8756,192

I won't be surprised if the teenage years now move on to their post-Jack lives and their grieving him, but the beauty of the way this story is told is that that's only one small part of a much larger picture.

"Nah, that's really unfair. It's not like she was begging Jack to go back in- she was a 17 year old girl completely understandably upset that her dog was trapped in the burning house, so she was calling for him! Jack chose to go back in because HE couldn't bare to see her so upset, and then he chose to take even more time in the smoke to try and get as many of their prized possessions as possible. 

He was amazing, but let's be real.. it was so heroic that it was reckless too. He was so concerned in the moment about keeping the family's losses as minimal as possible in a terrible situation that he put his own life in danger. That's not on Kate, that's all Jack. And ultimately, it was his overabundance of goodness and determination to do right by his family that caused them to lose him, which is SO MUCH WORSE than what they would have lost if he'd just not been in that smoke for so long.",-0.9628,190

I loved Kevin's talked at the maybe the wrong tree. LOL  I hope he finally made peace with his dad.  I think he really needed that talk.

The twist with Tess being the adult social worker helping out that little boy surprised me.  They even said her name and Randall kissed her, I didn't put two and two together until I saw Deja at the door.  That was a good twist.  It was good to see Deja back.  I don't know if her name was still in the credits since her last episode, but if it wasn't, I should had catch that at the beginning when I saw Lyric's name in the opening credits.  Than again.  Who pays attention to the opening credits these days. LOL

It was good to see Gerald McRaney coming back for tonght's episode..  I was shocked to see Dr. K in the previews.  When I saw him on the screen, I was like, ""Dr. K!!""  I wonder if he was still alive or he came back as a ghost to talk to her.""  He has to be something 90 almost 100.  He was 70 in 1980.  Then they visit him at the hospital.  So he was about 89 then.  Then 1998, he has to be around 97.  So he's either was still alive or he was a ghost.

I think This is Us will be on hiatus for a few weeks because of the Winter Olympics.  So tonight's episode is the last for a few weeks.  I hope its not a big cliffhanger.

I don't think we have seen the last of Milo because there's a lot of history they have show.  Like what happened in Vietnam, where is his brother, of course when the big 3 were 9 and whatever else we haven't seen.
