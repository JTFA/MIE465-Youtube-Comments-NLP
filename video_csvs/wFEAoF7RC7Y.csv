"@atrios28 I've recently responded to a similar request on GOK Pt. 2. IMO the modular nature of the Smile recordings makes the prospect of creating videos like this series unlikely. Also, many of the Smile sessions out there are either incomplete or lacking in sound quality, so it depends on what exactly the new box set adds to the mix.

At this point I'm just trying to finish covering Pet Sounds. I do plan to make a video on Good Vibrations, which in itself will be a huge undertaking.",0.9337,98
@atrios28 Let Him Run Wild = my favorite track on the Summer Days album.  It was essentially a prototype for the music heard on Pet Sounds.  A must-listen.  The new stereo mix on the Warmth Of The Sun compilation is sublime.,0.7184,45
@d15er Not true.  Brian was heavily involved with Sunflower (As well as a ton of other songs from 1969 rejected by Warner).,0.1531,26
"@diamondbackseye The ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" book is nearly all bunk...it's basically a collection of random snippets from BW interviews mixed with complete fabrications. ""That's Not Me"" was recorded with the group...verified by both the session tape and AFM contracts.

The Beach Boys played on nearly all of their records prior to 1965...with the occasional saxophone or drum part played by a session musician. Jon Stebbins and other authors have brought this to light in the last few years.",0.3544,93

"Hi BehindTheSounds! I love your video. It is great! I have always wanted to hear how brian wilson arranged his songs. I wanted to ask you a question. Where is that photo from at 1:30 and at 3:17. It looks like they are rehersing for a concert. Brian is playing his balwin organ. If you could answer my question sometime soon, THAT WOULD BE GREAT! Thanks for the video!",0.9702,80
I agree totally..even on earlier albums and live concert footage Dennis was a good drummer. He really is underated.,0.6597,23
I always wondered if for sure this was Mike singing. It sounds almost too good to be him. His voice has that little bit of ragged edge that identifies it as his.,0.6022,35

I had previously considered the Boys to be simple face value surf rock. This video series is incredibly enlightening. ""That's Not Me"" has been one track that I continue to be amazed and sentimental about at each listen. Now, because of this video I see why this song arrangement baffles me. Once again, I thank you - I can't say it enough.",0.9617,105
"I love everyone here...you're like family.  BW and the BB have been part of my life since 1965.  Brian Wilson has had a most significant influence on my career.  You know there is a God when you actually get to meet and play in a studio with your idol, as I did in 1977.  This clip is an astounding revelation to me as I was convinced that all of ""PET"" was with the Crew.  Brian's use of multiple basses playing different parts is groundbreaking.  I will be here all night!!",0.9594,103

Pet Sounds is the best album ever!!!!,0.7482,10
Probably one of my absolute favorite Brian Wilson compositions. It brings me back to my awkward teenage years when it came out. The beautiful arrangement just jumped out of the record player at me when I first heard this song at 17. An extremely sophisticated and emitional masterpiece.,0.9359,52

"Similar experience here, when I heard PS for the first time about 8 years ago.  My brother didn't like it so he gave it to me, thinking I might.  I was driving to an out of town gig and threw it in the CD player and was immediately hit by it.  I kept thinking, ""where has this record been all my life?"".  Then I geeked out on it for about 6 months and drove everyone crazy with it.  This is one of my favorite tracks, for sure.",0.1999,100

"They should release a pet sounds game where you get to make your own mixing of every song.  There are a lot of comments about what should be loud and what shouldn't, that type of thing being the biggest complaint.  I think it'd just be plain fun.  Like it could be a really simple game where it's just a mixing board you control with the mouse . Honestly don't care.  Doesn't even have to be a game.  

I just want to try doing my own mixings.  But games are fun.  Maybe testing your own ear by trying to match it to the original.

The 1st time I heard it, I recall just being in awe of the complex harmonics.  by that time, I really thought "" Keep An Eye ON Summer "", & "" Kiss Me Baby"", were the most brilliant I'd ever heard.  Pet Sounds took The BB's up into a level never even imagined.  Truly, it was revolutionary, in the Spring of '66, when I 1st heard "" Wouldn't It Be Nice "", & "" G.O. K. "".
