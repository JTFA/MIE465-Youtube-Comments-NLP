"@Antonio Brooks, id which X-men movies you've been watching but I'd day 95% deal with the human vs mutant war as a fundamental element to the story arc. Hell, even X2 has a whole ""coming out"" scene with Iceman. In Days of Future Past Peter Dinkledge's character sees the rise of the mutants as a threat to homosapien kind, echoing a lot of sentiments white slave owners had when slavery was outlawed and that whole ball got rolling. Its LITERALLY Magneto's whole struggle every movie, the hatred of homosapiens, fear of those that look like us but are born different therefore we hate them , because we don't understand them. THIS IS LITERALLY 99% OF THE X-MEN MOVIES EMOTIONAL CORE. Even Logan explored these themes.  Everyone keeps saying look at how dark the Netflix films are, it'll be fine but y'all forget to look at big of a chinnese wall there is between resident serial killer The Punisher and your mainstream MCU. They've pretty much said multiple times those characters will never meet. They never even say the Avenger's names, just the green guy and other vague terms so distance the two franchises and that's not by accident.",-0.9907,218

"Disney getting the rights to X-men back is so bittersweet to me. I've loved most of the Fox X-men movies, Days of Future Past is my favorite comicbook film of all time, and it always felt darker, and more serious than their other comicbook counterparts and thats why i loved it. It wasn'tbirght and spunky, because the X-men tell very different, more true to life , stories about prejudice and analogies of social issues etc and I just don't see Disney doing that if they're going to fold the X-men into the ongoing MCU (which by the way is already SO crowded but hey lets add 40 more characters). Also this means as X-men fans we'll now be getting 1 or 2 X-men related films every 2-3 years instead of 1-3 a year so that's gonna be fun. What a great idea this whole thing is.",0.9465,158

"From a Merger and Acquisition point of view, the question that people need to ask is: why Disney is buying Fox. Again, it depends on what Disney is actually buying (just the IPs or the actual infrastructure of Fox), but if they are buying the entire Fox entertainment arm as opposed to just the IPs (for a lot more money btw), they have to justify it somehow to their investors. If they go that way and buy the entire structure of Fox, then my take is that they are planning to diversify their assets/product lines and demographic. It's their same reason for buying Marvel to begin with",0.8126,122

"Here's how I think Jackman could be inserted into the MCU. 
1. It can't be a role that requires him to get shredded, because that was a big reason why he was getting tired of playing Wolverine. The workout regimen and the diet are grueling. 
2. His presence will automatically have a meta element, so it might compliment one of the funnier or fantastical franchises.
3. It will be hard to disassociate his face with wolverine if he looks like standard Hugh Jackman.
So I think a good spot for him, would be to voice a mocap version of Beta Ray Bill. He would fit seamlessly into a Thor 4 or a GOTG 3 movie. His face will not be seen so it won't distract. He keeps his Aussie accent that fits well in a Taika Wattiti film with New Zealanders and Australians. Mocap means he doesn't need to be ultra ripped. And, ultra bonus, you can still cast Hugh Jackman as something else in the MCU if you want.",0.9674,189

He said before how complicated it is doing things like that, but it really does suck Disney couldn't have made a deal with Fox before all of this to use Wolverine, similar to what they did with Sony for Spider-Man.

"Jayson's Rage that‚Äôs more so on what Fox is willing to give up. If Fox sells completely, of course a lot of its employees will lose their jobs but if they reach a deal similar to Disney and Sony, people will keep their jobs and form a creative team. Fox still has a huge presence in the film/TV industry and Disney is definitely smart enough to not remove that presence completely. More than likely Disney will make Fox a subsidiary like it did with Marvel, Touchstone and Miramax. Fox can still produce its own material, but Disney will have to ultimately approve or disapprove because they‚Äôll be distributing and marketing the films/shows. The fact Disney has enough money in its stocks to buy Fox for $60 billion and Fox is actually considering it means Fox isn‚Äôt generating enough revenue on its own",0.9575,162
"Jayson's Rage well considering Fox‚Äôs X-Men franchise is literally what‚Äôs keeping Fox alive financially, it‚Äôs going to be brought up regardless. No Fox franchise has generated anywhere near the $5 billion+ that the X-Men franchise has. Alien and Planer of the Apes franchises do well critically but never that well financially. Deadpool alone made $800 mil off a $60 mil budget, Logan made $620 mil off $100 mil budget, that franchise is the only thinking keeping Fox afloat right now and I‚Äôm sure Fox was the one who reached out to Disney for this deal just like how Sony reached out to Disney for the Spider-Man deal because Sony was spending $250-300 mil on TAS series and they didn‚Äôt generate as much as the studio expected them too",0.8201,151

"Paully808 you literally named 2 out of 10 films that have addressed some kind of social issue... yeah ok. Fox has been only focusing on developing Wolverine while the rest of the X-Men get thrown under the bus. Storm‚Äôs claustrophobia and exceptional combat skills are nonexistent, Cyclops‚Äô leaderships barely got shown, Rogue is a strong southern belle with a headstrong personality but she‚Äôs a scared girl in the films and since when was Mystique a hero... Fox has done more damage to the X-Men franchise by having every film be about ‚ÄúMutants on the run‚Äù when the X-Men are much larger than that",-0.7869,117

"Why is there a Bachelor contestant guy on here? Was this per Ashley's request?
I tuned him out after he wanted Venom just because it's rated R. Tom Hardy can't save that movie. Just like Tom Cruise couldn't save The Mummy. Just like hot young actors couldn't save Fant4stic. Just like Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Jared Leto couldn't save Suicide Squad. Don't be fooled by Tom Hardy's casting. It's also NOT based on Agent Venom, it's based off of Lethal Protector... A FREAKING STORY ABOUT A VENOM SPIDER-MAN TEAM-UP!!! This thing reeks of creative bankruptcy.
This is 100% the doing of Avi Arad who was probably pissed about losing control of Spider-Man, so as a condition of the Marvel Spider-Man deal, he probably demanded he still get to make his Venom movie so that he could make a crap Venom-verse instead of the Spider-verse he was planning. 
And since Avi has lost his touch, he's just painting by numbers. Jumping on the Deadpool bandwagon of hard R superhero movies. Hiring a very recognizable actor. Getting a menh director who will do whatever you want him to. Pre-maturely announce sequels and spin-offs.",-0.8078,219

they could have r rated stuff in the mcu, look at the daredevil verse. didn't disney own mirmax back in the day? still?
they had some iffy things not for kids.

i hope deadpool stays as it is, connected to both. right? sort off. perhaps a little more connected to both?

future star wars criminal underworld stuff could be r rated. like the boba fett movie or the darth vader one.

scenes in tlj that lead nowhere!? some of the 30 min deleted scenes that would¬¥ve wrapped them up?

seth rogen was in Take This Waltz, was it good? heard it was heavy. 50/50 was ok if i remember correctly.

black panther looks great.

looking forward to the new predator also :). would be nice with another one off world.
