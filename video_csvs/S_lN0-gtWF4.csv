Chris Pridmore I'm saying this trailer is tonally all over the place and it left me uneasy. That's why I was asking what they were going for. Hopefully the movie isn't like this.,-0.2523,36
ChrisMisc1 I guess I agree with you but by the same token you got to give the man credit for being able to make the movie at his age and health. Guess I would have to watch it to make a fair opinion.,0.7964,46

"Looks great. Director Adam Rifkin did his best to make a great movie and it's always a joy to watch Burt onscreen. I am a fan of his and have been waiting this film since 2016, when it was being shot. Best of luck with the film and congrats to all involved. Easily, it'll be Burt Reynolds best film in the last decade, the one true film that gives him a chance to shine.",0.9909,82
Looks like one of the few A24 misses. Looks pretty bad.Why do people assume everything A24 is involved in will be good? They've released a bunch of terrible movies over the years. It's just that the good ones are great.,0.891,44

TheLetterU No trust me. This isn't a film that can be properly judged by a trailer. It's all about character. Character is a hard thing to establish in a trailer when they are so richly written like in this film. The film is phenomenal for the 2 main characters alone. Really great stuff. Give it a shot. I don't think you'll regret it.,0.9174,71

It's all about what one man's life means and how ""an audience can forgive a shitty act 2 if you can wow 'em in act 3"" meaning that he had some troubled times as a young adult through to a middle aged man, but he's atoning for it all in act 3. The characters are rich and drawn with lots of heart, the writing is amazing, as is the acting. The cinematography and such could use some work but no matter: this film is incredible.",0.9267,124
