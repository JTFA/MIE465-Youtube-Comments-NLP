Get the weight down to around 300g and you will be in business.  Use balsa ribs in a geodesic pattern, and cover with Ultracote or similar.

"use a wing profile with less upper slope, use light weight metal tanks for higher psi, use light weight metal gas tubing for your air hose and mill a lightweight metal engine block, then no airleaks.. The added weight will be offset by higher psi.. longer flight time for sure.. for mil/darp testing I prefer to use a copper skin over a thin aluminum or titanium airfoil, then prewire the skin for positive current and negative current. Use solar paint and pay attention to positively wired surfaces/negatively wired surfaces.. Solar duty is to partially charge the battery while running the engine... flight times of 24hrs or longer are achieved... Use carbon fiber and aluminum/titanium for the airframe skeleton, if titanium can be obtained.. This will achieve a semi combat ready platform.. projectiles tested for my builds were 23mm, 22mm, at 1750/1920fpps.. aircraft tested survived 20 strikes at 1000ft in flight before failing. aircraft design will determine failure rate just have to test different designs. good luck...",-0.6124,193
