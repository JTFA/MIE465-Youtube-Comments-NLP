"Lyrics

Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folk, tryna get by
I came through the struggle with my head high
You being broke think you know what it feel like
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich

Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right, if everybody eating that's a good night
Headed to the lost why I took flight, the hard times made for a good life
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich

[Lecrae:]
Never fell in love with the Coco, Never had to hold up the store with the .44
Never had the door kicked in by the feds while I'm laying in the bed on the bread that I'm gon' blow
But I do know what it feel like to go to school with the knock off shoes
Eating free lunch, tryna act all cool, boy you better know that we paid our dues
Never would I trade that, nah, 'cause it made me better, it could have made me bitter
Can't buy that struggle, can't name no figure, but it made me richer
Being broke made me rich, and being low made you quit
But being low made me high, take time if you want this

[King Los:]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folk, tryna get by
I came through the struggle with my head high
You being broke think you know what it feel like
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich

Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right, if everybody eating that's a good night
Headed to the lost is why I took flight, the hard times made for a good life
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich

[Lecrae:]
Money may have made me me richer, but the struggle got me richer than I ever been
Learn to hustle, use ya' muscles, learn to grind and keep ya' mind up on the future, man
We came out the trenches, government assistance in the beginning
Keeping cans for the pennies, we saving that grease after dinner
Now they counting all my pennies, counting all my figures, all up in my business, man
Now they watching what I'm spending, wonderin' what I got, and wonder how I get it, man
I was bought before I had a dollar, being empty handed made me stupid rich
Rich in loyalty, can't pay that lawyer fee, but it's all good
That's why I pitch it in

[King Los:]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folk, tryna get by
I came through the struggle with my head high
You being broke think you know what it feel like
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich

Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right, if everybody eating that's a good night
Headed to the lost is why I took flight, the hard times made for a good life
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, being broke made me rich",0.9953,637

"Remember that at one time we were separated from Christ,having no hope and without God in the world. We were enemies of God, alienated  and hostile in mind, and engaged in evil deeds. Being Gods enemies we were marked for Wrath. Nahum says The LORD is wrathful and takes vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves wrath for His enemies. 
But now in Christ Jesus we who were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. Jesus has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall, reconciling us to God through the cross and killing the hostility. We are now Friends of God! At one time all of Creation was crying out for our condemnation but now Jesus has cleansed us so thoroughly that now all of Creation has no choice but to cry out for our Salvation!
