"Charli, if you actually wrote  this, you have made a transition to greatness comparable to what happened to Sylvia Plath when her personal struggles  catapulted her into a loftier artistic realm. Resist the temptation to fall back into the usual banality that pervades pop music generally. This song should represent a new beginning for you and your audience.",-0.3612,63

"I'm not much of a pop music fan. Classical is more my thing, especially modernist classical music, Boulez, Stockhausen, also Phillip Glass,  John Cage, etc. I'm also deeply involved in the study of world music.  I came upon Charli by accident -- and i must say, despite my lack of interest in most pop or rock these days, this cut just blew me away. It's very rare that something this fresh and original comes along in ANY genre. Great singer, fantastic arrangement. So original. Keep up the great work, folks.",0.9629,109

"Lyrics: [Intro]
Eh-XCX

[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
Glitter in my sheets
Dancing on no sleep
I don't learn, wanna burn, wanna turn all the way up, yeah
I don't learn, wanna burn in the dirt 'til I'm out of luck, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Pills and potions and terrible things
Heart on the floor when the telephone rings
All of the lies I just wanna believe
Drop all my morals, I just wanna sin

[Chorus: Alma]
I'm out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head, out of my head

[Post-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Need you, need you, need you out
Need you, need you, need you out

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Partyin' with my tears
Swayin' with my fears
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let 'em dry, get me high, I'll get by if I'm getting love, yeah
Let 'em dry, get me high, I get by with a little love
Now give me

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo & Charli XCX]
Pills and potions and terrible things
Heart on the floor when the telephone rings
All of the lies I just wanna believe
Drop all my morals, I just wanna sin

[Chorus: Alma]
I'm out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head, out of my head
I'm out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head, out of my head

[Bridge: Tove Lo, Alma, & Charli XCX]
You got me doin' all this stupid shit
You fuck me up like this
Secretly I'm into it though
You got me doin' all this stupid shit
You fuck me up like this
Secretly I'm kinda into it though
(You fuck me up like this)
You got me doin' all this stupid shit
You fuck me up like this
Secretly I'm into it though
Got me doin' all this stupid shit
You fuck me up like this
Secretly I'm kind of into it

[Chorus: Alma]

Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
