"My bet is that the diamonds have a colour gradient, light grey at the bottom and lighter grey at the top, therefor a diamond would appear darker than the one below it because the darker grey (the bottom of the diamond) of the top diamond would be darker than the lighter grey (the top of the diamond) of the bottom diamond.",0.886,68
