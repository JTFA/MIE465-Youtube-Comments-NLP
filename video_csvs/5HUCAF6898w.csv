Awesome project!  and cheers Alex for winning the grand prize!,0.9551,12
"Excellent interview. About the fabrication, what do you recommend to an electrical engineer who has zero experience with mechanical stuff? And what do you think of Autodesk's Inventor?",0.7622,32
Genius design. Curious just how long range it is. It would be cool if it could surface and get some solar power or perhaps generate power from waves.,0.5574,31

"I was amazed by this design and idea, but later I saw there are almost the same designs from the past. Nevermind, great job!",0.8419,28
"Thank you! I need to perform extended endurance/range testing as the current endurance/range of the glider is calculated by extrapolating out current data (6 hour running battery life at ~0.2m/s = 4km). As the glider is only just getting to a point where hardware is complete, there are no power saving measures being used; the motors/boards do not power down when not in use and the microcontroller does not enter sleep mode. Solar panels are on the seemingly never ending list of nice-to-haves, once I get around to it =D",0.6833,108
Wonderful work! Keep us all updated!,0.6467,8
