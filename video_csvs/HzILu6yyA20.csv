"Bronson was great in the 1974 original. Willis is a natural, takes the role up a notch. You cant help but (secretly or openly) cheer for both! To quote the late, great Roger Ebert (1974), ""In ""Death Wish"" we get just about the definitive Bronson; rarely has a leading role contained fewer words or more violence."" Willis nails it. 
For those of you who winced at seeing the incompetent Democrat coward ""Sheriff"" Israel and his troop of sniveling pre-pubescent NRA-haters rant on CNN, this film is medicine.",0.1687,108
