"+Subri Subrika  Oh, because you mention CBC blocking ""anti-semetic"" comments. That would mean from people who don't support Jerusalem being the capital. But CBC also doesn't support it, so that would be a strange reason to block comments. I think it's pro-Jewish comments that they want to block.
So, you don't support Jerusalem being the Jewish capital?",-0.9284,68
"+Subri Subrika  Oh, so you also support Trump saying Jerusalem's the true capital of Israel. Yes, me too.

You need to ask how did ISIS just get more weapons and more money wherever America was in the same country as them. As soon as Russia got involved it only took 2 years to free Syria from them. Maybe America with its 700 billion a year budget is just bad at war and that's why it's constantly destroying resource rich countries to try beat back the ever growing terrorists that seem to follow them.
