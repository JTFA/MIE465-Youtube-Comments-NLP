Ashton Parson a couple things to that...why can't it be two trans/cis gender/non binary than? A gay male and a trans female makes absolutely no sense unless he bi/straight? Or of they were gay trans?.....,-0.4648,47
"Ashton Parson completely understand now and concur with what you want come across to the audience however I guarantee most audiences wouldn't know these two fall under lgbt/queer. There's nowhere in this video that portrays that for people to notice queer love. There's nothing wrong with putting two beautiful human together to show love is love, but make it known in the video, like a back story before the music starts to show where they came from in life and how love brought them together unconditionally. From an outsider aspect it's just looks like the norm of another straight cis gender typical love story. Can't see the beautifully captired indifference portrayal of queer love.",0.9879,123

"Can we start showcasing artists like this on all big streaming, media, and award shows, instead of the 90% of garbage mainstream artists that get all the attention, acclaim, and money? I think people fail to realize that Music and Song Writing is an ART FORM! We're all too dumb and distracted with these stick figure and color by number artists, that we are basically oblivious and neglectful to all the da Vincis, Monets, Warhols, and Van Goghs of the music industry. What does this say about the people listening to, sharing, purchasing, and advocating today's music? The spotlight ought to be redirected, like now!",-0.3703,124

"Moose8Tube I’m sure no matter what type of couple it was, there would always be a complaint/something to be said as everyone always has SOMETHING to say or an issue. Apologies though, as I misspoke because I replied to this in a hurry; the male actor identifies as Queer, the female character identifies as Trans Femme. I would know this, given I was very vocal in the casting of this video/sang & wrote the song and came up with this treatment with the director. I When I was approaching this, I thought it was more important to implement LGBTQ actors/characters to tell a story of love more than anything else. I stumbled across these two beautiful humans and fell in love with their chemistry. Love does not have limits, and no one can be told who they can and can not fall in love with. I am honored to have had these two characters portray these roles with this narrative. Queer love is real. Queer love is extraordinary and it deserves a platform as well. The layers beneath this main concept also touch on the dangers of co-dependency & self love that ultimately allow you to be at peace with having to let go/move on from things that feel comfortable at times. My main objective is always to highlight every layer of the community that I am a part of and support. I will always work with/highlight/advocate and include individuals from the LGBTQ community in everything that I do. Long story short, the most important thing is to provide a platform, which we/they/all truly deserve. I am sorry this didn’t make sense for you personally, was confusing or that you were off put by this casting but I hope you understand the bigger picture here.",0.9844,340
Moose8Tube it’s a transgender female and gay male. it’s to champion queer love and not focus on just heterosexual or homosexual relationships exclusively. he has made it very vocal that his point was to highlight trans characters in narratives that they typically don’t get.,0.8885,54

"Only You Lyrics!🤘😎
[Verse 1]
And I need your love, I need you here with me
And I don't care 'bout much else
And I know it's hard for five million reasons
But I don't think I could wait

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm feeling your love it's like a wind that blows
I can't give up and I can't let go
I won't give up, I won't lose
When I'm broken down and I'm bruised
I'm gonna get myself back home to you, ooh

[Chorus]
Only you-ah
Only you-ah
Only you-ah
Only you

[Verse 2]
And I need someone to lay down beside me
'Cause I can't sleep by myself
And my poor old heart's in five million pieces
Now I'm asking for your help

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm feeling your love it's like a wind that blows
I can't give up and I can't let go
I won't give up, I won't lose
When I'm broken down and I'm bruised
I'm gonna get myself back home to you, ooh
 

[Chorus]
Only you-ah
Only you-ah
Only you-ah
Only you

[Bridge]
You-ah
You-ah

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm feeling your love it's like a wind that blows
I can't give up and I can't let go
I won't give up, I won't lose
When I'm broken down and I'm bruised
I'm gonna get myself back home to you, ooh

Only you-ah
