Seeing how America was fighting Communism all over the world at the time, it doesn't make any sense why the would ""fund and support"" the Khmer rouge considering Khmer rouge translates to Communist red. Even a quick Google search states that: The Khmer Rouge's army was slowly built up in the jungles of Eastern Cambodia during the late 1960s and was supported by the North Vietnamese army, the Viet Cong, and the Pathet Lao, with strong supports from the People's Republic of China; the latter had a huge influence on the Party later.",0.891,160

The reason I used the word ""possibly"" is because the president does not authorize every trigger pull, every high explosive ordinance drop or even every agent Orange usage.

President or no, you're also casting the American /people/ in a bad light. Did they as a massive group sign off on the atrocities committed? No, they just voted for the leader.

It's good to remember. But the blame lies squarely on the individuals who made the decisions that led to the atrocities.

"The 1970-75 conflict in Cambodiam was a spillover of America's war against the North Vietnamese. The NVA had invaded Cambodia 'illegally' early in their war of communist aggression. As the situation devolved, communist forces took over more and more of the country. The US-backed government headed by Lon Nol  fought against Khmer Rouge insurgents supported by the government in Hanoi. The Democrats and their armies of Russian-influenced street protesters determined that war would be eventually won by the Maoist-influenced Khmer Rouge forces. These anti-American communists then put in place a murderous four-year regime that caused the death of up to 2 million people.

Pol Pot was a communist even Noam Chomsky originally loved as Noam felt Pot had the ""Year Zero"" plan for rural socialism down pat. Marxist professors are progressively wrong. History has been decidedly unkind to the communist side of the conflict overseas. I was obsessed with the war growing up such that I actually majored in political science in hopes of gaining a proper understanding of the whys and wherefores of the quagmire in the jungle. While I'm no expert, I do believe after decades of talking to Vietnam vets and reading their blood books and studying the enemy that we were opposed to the communists. Most would agree, even if you don't.

I also later attended journalism school for a time where I discovered there are holes in mass media education a jihadi could drive a truckload of Nikita Khrushchev's expensively printed -- but unread --autobiographies through and go completely unnoticed.

After graduation, I traveled a bit to East Asia at a time when the returning to the States jumbo 747's were regularly packed to the gills with desperate 'boat people' fleeing the excesses that necessarily come with properly applied communism. In college, I worked in a restaurant kitchen with refugees from Vietnam telling tales of the woes of life under Marxism after the fall. The war was bad, we can all agree, but the killing didn't really begin in earnest until the good guys, our nation, abandoned the field to evil Marxists like Pol Pot.

Your Marxist professors were on the wrong side of the war back in the day. They have learned nothing since then, so they lie and hope to turn little Chris Hadfield's into 'progressive-minded' propagandists who reflexively blame America first, even when the leftover landmines have 'made in the People's Republic"" stamped on them.

Blaming US for the sins of a Maoist like Pot is BS Bolshevik bigotry, not history. It is widely understood no one gets a job as a commercial journalistic hireling in the press profession without leftist sensibilities. It is a given that we all enjoy a decidedly leftist mass media. If the young reporter hasn't eaten the garden Noam Chomsky revisionist history sandwich they will risk be employed as carpenters and plumbers instead. 

Cambodian politics during the war were no doubt problematic and cramped with confusion and complexity and reflected the chaos caused by killer communist aggression. I am so old I can still remember when I first heard Sean Flynn, the son of the famous actor Errol Flynn, and another journalist, Dana Stone, disappeared without trace after encountering a hostile communist checkpoint south-east of Phnom Penh. 

When I recall this old feeling today, I imagine Chris Hadfield on that moped in Flynn's place. Imagine some modern fellow red flag-waving traveler trying to make out like a nice, photogenic reporter with those dead-eyed, bombed out Khmer Reds as he was led, talking away about how bad is America, on that sullen, one way walk into the jungle the so many innocent people took once the enemies of US got control on the ground.",-0.998,679

1) The Americans, British, French, Chinese, Thai, Soviet, Cambodian, Japanese, Canadian, and Vietnamese governments are all responsible for the massive current devastation of Laos and their regions.

It also should be mentioned that many of the bombs are also remnant of the Second World War and the First Indochina war and not necessarily of America's Secret War.
2) Something to mention is that the reason many are quite and want to discard the remnants of war is because this was not a foreign war on their battleground between the Soviet sponsored Vietnamese and the American backed Thai. This was a war also in the country itself with brother against brother against brother, kids who had no idea of what they were getting themselves into (some only as tall as their guns) were recruited to fight into armies.

The US has tried to clean up Laos but all the money goes directly into the pockets of the commie dictators and their families.If you want some good ideas on what videos to do next about Laos I would suggest doing one on the wealth gap between the rich commie families and the everyday poor. You will see a $100k Mercedes rolling by on pot hole filled roads in Laos while some can't even afford shoes. Although if you do a series on this, I would suggest leaving the country before you air that video because your life will be in danger after. Foreign Aid doesn't reach the people of Laos, it goes into the pockets of you know who but can't mutter their names or you will disappear.Another series I would suggest doing is about the illegal logging and deforestation of Laos by Vietnam and China. The Laos commies say it's illegal but they are the ones allowing it to happen so they can sell the natural resources of Laos to get rich and have been doing it since the end of the War in 1976. When there are 50 logging trucks in a row carrying tons of trees going towards the Vietnam border from Laos, you can't tell me that no one can notice that? Again, if you do a series on this, you risk your life.One more thing I want to mention is that they Hydro dams that are being built on the Mekong in Laos are also to benefit the rich commies. The high speed rail that is being proposed is also to the benefit of the Chinese. Lao people can't afford to ride that train.Losing this war meant that Laos is no longer meant for the Lao people, it is now raped by it's neighbors who ""won"" the war.

"You're only thinking the US is less bad because you're on their side. Zoom out from your subjective bubble and see that US is equally bad in almost every way(worse in some even). The US is indirectly responsible for more wars than I can think of. Luckily i'm a Westerner so the US has made life easier for me but i'm certain the amount of people that has died, suffered and been suppressed far outnumber the people who has gained from US imperialism. there is no way to justify it other than pure self-benefit(the same goes for China).",-0.8361,110
