Only one thing to add: What he is describing is a system of stages on a social demographic model that ranks countries based on population growth and development. When a population has short growth, they are stage 1, medium growth is stage 2, an explosive and intense growth being stage 3 and finally stage 4 is the population leveling out in terms of growth. What he failed to mention was that their is a possible stage 5 that both Japan and Russia are experiencing where the population begins to shrink drastically. So saving lives could solve overpopulation not just prevent it.",0.9123,120

"I certainly buy the claim that improvement in standards of overall health would decrease the number of new children.  This, however, brings to mind two questions when thinking about overpopulation.  1) if people are living longer on average, does this still amount to more people alive even if less people are born? 2) In some ways the effects of lower child per family rates are actually already integrated into the population curve.  It is probably true that there is some delay in the effect which we may see from improvement of population health to reduction in the rate of increase of the population, but the fact still does stand that I believe (and how useful my beliefs are is probably another topic for debate) that the effect of a decrease in the birth rate is integrated into the population curve already.

It does not include increased resource consumption per capita, nor the shift in the global demographic pyramid that is to be expected as a result of families having less children.

Second, we can already see in more developed countries that the population is ageing and becoming increasingly dependent on healthcare and resources for which the individual that needs it can no longer perform the production. This also implies that people have to work longer (but where does it end?), or resource production/extraction has to increase per capita for the working population to sustain the increasingly large top of the pyramid, should the overall population want to maintain a similar level of welfare throughout its life.",-0.4815,156
