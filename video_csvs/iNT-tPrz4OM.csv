On the topic of psychiatric drugs from
Earlier interview,  Nutrition can be lacking in many people‚Äôs lives if they
Are workaholics.  Even extreme athletes,  rock musicians, movie stars,
And extremely dedicated laborers.
Our Country has to treat every human
Body as valuable. And just like a Lamborghini if it doesn‚Äôt have the best
Gas and car fluids, and if it doesn‚Äôt get
A rest from high speed driving once in a while it can break down.

With out going in long conversation
I will say that if each person lived by Golden Rule and if you would never want your self or your child labeled
Or given Ritalin,  you should never
Do it to someone else‚Äôs kid.

I think it‚Äôs a crooked way to get wealth
To make money off of destroying other 
People, and many people use their
Job title ,their status, their money to destroy instead of make each person in America the best, healthiest balanced,
Purposeful person they can be.

Frankly, if parents don‚Äôt talk and teach 
And praise and support their children
How are they supposed to know about
Living adult in America.
And everybody needs someone to talk 
To once in awhile .  We wouldn‚Äôt need
Psychologists if everyone were a caring friend when others needed
Help.

We could eliminate guns and shooting 
And most drugs and psychological 
Labeling which is really the NEW acceptable murdering or social
Leprocy.   Hospitals and nurses could
Be cut in half, prison, jail and courts could be cut in half. 
We could have more farmers more 
Small business owners,  more positive
