And overtime the non blue birds died off and the blue birds that could see blue all reproduced and now we have blue jays. Yeah?

When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colors because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight, due to the angle the light hits the atmosphere. At this angle it scatters red light because of the dust, soot, pollen etc in the air.",0.3818,101

"It's Okay To Be Smart I am confused because I thought all color worked that way? I read a couple years ago that the world is values ranging between black and white and it is our eyes and brains that perceive their ""color"" by what frequencies of light are absorbed and what is reflected. Learning that helped me understand a little more how some people can be color blind (having less cones in their eyes so as not being able to percieve those colors) or why they can tell that some animals can see no color and some to a range of colors far beyond what humans can see (having many more cones in their eyes) But in this video you talk of actual pigments of color as well as the shape and patterns that cause us to perceive blue in that butterfly so now I'm confused again.

"So you're saying that pigment and microscopic structure that gives blue color is somehow different?

But the physics of absorption and reflection is based upon the interaction of light with the structure of material. So the only difference is that the pigment is synthesized chemically and this structure on butterfly wings is just ""grow"" that way.",0.34,99
