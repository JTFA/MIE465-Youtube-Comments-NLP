"Bellicose Trump-Pence are afraid of the “Moonshine Policy” for the Korean Peninsula.
That is the reason why they are obstructing diplomacy. Anglo-American Rogue Regime is terrified that Peace may break out in North-South Korea!!  Peace is not fun for the axis of evil, these humanoids killing machines are salivating to start a Nuclear war in the Korean Peninsula!! for all the warmongers out there, North Korea is a non-interventionist Country and not a threat to the World and neither is Iran. Weak-up people stop watching TV and start using your critical minds otherwise we are lost in this jungle of deceived and lies giving to us by the “The Ministry of truth” aka the Zionist Jewish State war propaganda machine. America is the biggest threat to humanity and with Trump making the Israeli Rogue Regime Great Again, the threat of and all-out war is getting even worse!!...
 North-Korea’s Nuclear Program is purely defensive. Kim Jong-Un is not expansionist and he is not pushing a philosophy around the World of destabilizing other Countries. The greatest exporters of terrorism in the World, aka the Zionists-AIPAC backstabbers & traitors and our government with a never-ending cycle of violence and settlement activity have the monopoly on war and terror and are responsible for the creation of ISIS (and their rebranding names) and for the terrible crimes committed in the Middle East and all around the Globe.
North/South Korea must stand up your ground now and send the Yankees home before these Neo Zionists entities start killing you all without an ounce of remorse!! Anglo-American Rogue Regime has never been in-terested in improving human rights in the Countries they have invaded. It is all about mass killings and stealing of another Country’s natural resources. The people of the Korean Peninsula must wake-up and act now and start protesting this foreign invasion before is too late and the ICBMS start falling on your heads!! The so called American “Humanitarian interventions and spreading of Democracy throughout the World with good and sweet intentions at heart.”  is good for wiping my bottom. I repeat, American improvements of human rights abroad is all about Destabilizing the World to closed billions in weapons deals at the cost of massive loss of human life and the stealing of the Country’s natural resources. It is up to you North/South Korea to decide your own future, managed your own natural resources, and became the true masters of your own destiny!! Never disarm yourself, the Western Allies are not to be trusted. Plain and simple. Unification will take decades but not need to hurry up the process. A Soft-landing policy where emphasis is giving to reconciliation, economic co-operation and unification next is the way to go… 

The Holy and Saint Zionist Jew States of America Promoting ""freedom and democracy"" abroad are doing more evil than good. And just because America has more arms than any other Country in the World doesn’t mean that they have the truth of know what Democracy is all about. In every aspect of the American Political Establishment the Deep State have the power and rule the World. The Deep State is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds. Therefore, American governments are not any longer friendly to freedom and Democracy.

Trump-Pence and his cabinet are nothing but fascists dictators raping the World!! That is why Nuclear weapons are a very important deterrent against American foreign interventionism. The Countries that already have these Nuclear arsenals must never ever give them up. Nuclear weapons have become an important equilibrium to maintain Peace in the World. American is the only Nuclear Power that has used Nuclear Weapons against humanity. America Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 must always be remembered. During a foreign policy briefing several months ago, Trump asked three times in an hour, ""If we have them, Nuclear Weapons, why can't we use them?"" Talmudic Trump is a dangerous mind with dangerous toys around him!!

The World doesn’t need Zionist bellicose Trump, therefore Ignoramus dotard Trump can go to hell now!! Trump-Pence and the Pentagon are using their double CIA agent Otto Warmbiers, that was caught red handed doing bad things in North Korea, as propaganda rhetoric to start a Nuclear war in the Korean Peninsula. The Anglo-American Rogue Regime abuse of Power and foreign committed democide, genocide and mass murder in this century is criminal to the core!! This malevolent Power needs to be contain because this Regime is killing human beings around the World at will for their own evil benefits!!",-0.9982,863

Remember that in that when he took office, one of the first things he tried to do was to block further deployment of the THAAD, a purely defensive weapon system, much to the delight of North Korea and China.

"The American propaganda war machine is always accusing other World powers of oppression and wrong doings in their Countries but is unable to confront their own vicious crimes. All the wars that the Anglo-American Rogue Regime has begun, were based in “properly investigated and concluded double checked probabilities” Aka, their well thought out false flags. Bellicose Trump-Pence  are afraid of the ‘Moonshine’ Policy for the Korean Peninsula.That is why they are obstructing diplomacy. They are terrified that Peace may break out in North-South Korea!!  Peace is not fun for the axis of evil, they want war.There is no money in peace...
Wherever Anglo-American Rogue Regime goes death and destruction follows. Jewish Zionist America is good in the “divide and conquer strategy.” And their Western war propaganda is a massive power in creating false flags to escalated conflicts all around the World. A couple of examples: The Shot down of Flight M-17 in Ukraine to push war against Russia, the USA and NATO were the responsible ones. Libya, Muhammar Gaddafi killed, their Country Totally destroyed. It all was done based on fabricated evidences. Hillary Clinton ""We Came, We Saw, He Died"" Hahahahaha....https://youtu.be/FmIRYvJQeHM   Iraq, Saddam Hussein falsely accused of possessing weapons of mass destruction. Thousands of innocent citizens dead and the Country destroyed.  Syria, False flags (still going on) Sarin gas, meant to discredit and overthrow Assad. Yemen, was pushed into war, that is still going on, with the Saudis because Yemen voted negative in the United the Nations against the war against Iraq. Invading sovereign Countries, removing their governments and killing lots and lots of people is very profitable for the Military Industrial Complex. And the Rothchild Zionist bankers are very proud of it all and laughing at humanity!!
The media has always been the propaganda arm of the American Jewish Zionist war machine!! U.S.-funded political “NGOs” and media companies have worked with the CIA and foreign policy establishment since the 1980s to promote the American geopolitical agenda. If that is not state-sponsored networks tell me then what it is? The American people and the West in general are carefully shielded from hearing the ‘other side of the story. And that is what investigative journalism of alternative News Channels do well, to tell both sides of the story. Zionist Jews never ever like to be confronted with their crimes. They are unable to deal with the truth. That is the reason why they are censoring the Real News outlets. Anyone who dares to expose the truth and have deep knowledge of who is pulling the strings and pushing for wars is being pointed out as “fake news” and as a propagandist and anti-establishment.
The American propaganda war machine is always accusing other World powers of oppression and wrong doings in their Countries but is unable to confront their own vicious crimes. Let’s name one example of the millions of cases where employees of the Anglo-American killing machine were sacrificed for the benefit of Neozionisme.
 
The Russiagate scandal: The interference in the 2016 elections was the work of the FBI-CIA and other American Intelligence Agencies. Seth Rich (RIP) was one of the victims who knew too much and got killed in the process of moving Hillary to Power…but certainly not the only one that disappeared in the election process. So, don’t tell me that the Saint and Holy Anglo-American Rogue Regime is the Immaculate Democracy of the World!! And it was us motherfucking Americans who created ISIS and used ISIS for our own agendas!!...After 7 years in Syria ISIS was getting stronger and stronger. 
Why? because fighting Assad means supporting  American creations Isis and Al Qaeda...https://youtu.be/zGEc-CMsrQs hundreds of innocent civilians were killed; and it all for the benefit of Israhell and the Military Industrial Complex. In 2 years Russia has almost finished (work in progress.) the Israhell Anglo-American “Moderated Rebels” creations!! Nobody denies that America could destroy whatever they decide, wherever, anytime, but If America want to eradicate terrorism, for real, around the World; USA must start with the American Military Industrial complex and the criminal sell-outs who are benefiting from all these filthy wars going on around the World!!
The only Power fighting Islamic terrorism is Russia and her allies. Russia is an Honest Peace broker in International war conflicts. They really know how to confront war situations by using military force when necessary and ASAP bringing the parties involved in the conflict to the negotiation table. Through consistence and integrity Russia has achieved enormous stability in Syria and the rest of the Middle East.

Trumpolini, Self- Glorification is asking “his Generals” for a Military Parade!!
Trump's madness poses and existential threat to all humanity. Trump's speech at the United the Nations is insid-iously evil. Trump provided his twisted rationalization for worldwide war and genocide. From the Ukraine to the South China Sea.   https://youtu.be/H5583ceJQgY
Killary Clinton ""We Came, We Saw, He Died"" Hahaha.  https://youtu.be/FmIRYvJQeHM 
Libya, Muhammar Gaddafi killed, their Country Totally destroyed. It all was done based on fabricated evi-dences. NO WARS FOR TRUMP. NO MORE WARS FOR NETANYAHU...
During a foreign policy briefing several months ago, Trump asked three times in an hour, ""If we have them, Nuclear Weapons, why can't we use them?"" Talmudic Trump is a dangerous mind with dangerous toys around him! The World doesn’t need Zionist bellicose Trump, therefore Ignoramus dotard Trump can go to hell now!! 
Trump praises himself “as not smart, but genius.” The only thing Trumpolini, admirer of Mussolini, brilliantly do well, is pushing for war day in day out. Trump is salivating to start a war in Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Ukraine, Pakistan and very much anywhere else in the World. Talmudic Trumpolini is the most ignorant Presi-dent ever elected. He is not known from his knowledge of History, Geography, International Laws and Di-plomacy…these are just a few important subjects that a President ought to know. And Let’s not forget that to show to the World who his political role models are, Trump retweeted a Benito Mussolini Quote: 
 “It is better to live one day as a Lion than 100 years a sheep.” -Benito Mussolini.
Trump have more in common with the fascism founder than he realizes because Trump and the Rothschild’s Zionist Jews Supremacists insane foreign policy is rooted in the principles of the Talmud book which is based in racism, discrimination and apartheid. The hatred that Trump is spreading around the World raises big ques-tions about Trump and his cabinet ideology. Trump is such a divisive figure. He is supporting the butchers of South the Arabia in their aerial attacks on Yemen and Syria. And Trump-Kushner they both have being fund-ing for years the settlements in the occupy territory of the West Bank and Golan Heights. The recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel only added fuel to the fire, because by ignoring all International Laws and the United the Nations resolutions this process Legalized Israel as the apartheid Rogue Regime that it already was. In fact, Talmudic Trump is giving Netanyahu a Free pass for the systematic and brutal extermination of the Palestinian people and that is a war crime!!  Netanyahu and the Zionist Trump-Kushner clan should be con-victed and executed for war crimes against humanity!!
Trump-Pence and his cabinet are nothing but fascists dictators raping and plundering the World!! The axes of evil Israhell-America & The Saudis are busy planting false flags at all fronts to advance their evil purposes. Every move the American Rogue Regime makes leads to deceived and…
""No matter who's behind Syria 'chemical attack,' Russia to blame - Tillerson""
Jared Kushner is wreaking havoc in the Middle East. Kushner said: 14:31- 2th video ""we are making progress unifying every country in the Middle East against Iran “aggression.” The riots that we see now in Iran and the false flags in Syria are been organized by the Zionist Supremacist and the Saudis. These motherfuckers want to set the Middle East on fire!! Jared Kushner said: “This is a perfectly qualified team...and then he emphasis: I was joking.  https://youtu.be/OAgMPfd-Ylk  https://youtu.be/67y2V3ksdlA 
Wherever Anglo-American Rogue Regime goes death and destruction follows. Hundreds of people are getting killed in the Middle East alone just to satisfy Israhell and Anglo-America greedy stealing of natural resources and for the olie pipeline, and all Trump-Kushner clan do is to make fun of the whole situation and laugh at humanity?!! Trumps Presidency and his Neo Zionists Supremacist clans are dangerous to the core and their warmongering equals evil John McCain & Butcher Bush 2.0 and once and for all shows to the World that the Deep State, is just the normal behaviour of the United the States. America is the biggest threat to humanity and with Trump making the Israeli apartheid Rogue Regime Great Again, the threat of and all-out war is getting even worse!!...",-0.9989,859
