"I offer my opinion to foster positive dialogue on this content. Aside from the racial tone this video attempts to present let's broaden our thinking for a moment. Understanding of history and law is greater than just assuming bias on the basis of color. Most if not all Police and or Sheriff's departments are formed under a corporate system of City of, County of, State of and so forth. These corporate systems have an operating budget that is designed to transfer resources (money). Citations, traffic tickets, investigatory stops, and arrests are all actions that generate income for the corporate structure of that city, county, township, and or state. We must move to educate ourselves on the fact that Policing actions are primarily those of a debt collector for the corporate structure. Communities of the corporate city structure that provide the least tax revenue receive the most policing activities. The Officers that complicitly work in those communities are trained to not respect the constituents because they see them as a drain on the corporate system thus, create scenarios where they can use the power of law to generation revenue through citations, traffic violations, and arrests. The data of those activities are used against the community to present it as unsafe and label it a ""High Crime Area"". Ironically, that is the basis for corporate structure to generate greater funding for policing activities, which continues the cycle to deplete the community of all tax base, business, land, and human resource. Ultimately, the banks come in and buy the land for pennies on the dollar, then seek federal funds to revitalize the area and sell it to investors that increase land and property cost to push out anyone left. This is a game being played on the living persons of this land, we have to wake up, it is not about the color of skin, just the color of money.",-0.6546,355

"Smooth kriminal:  
Because you're not in the position of power.  Because you need every ally (or at least non-opponent) you can get.  You don't have to be everyone's friend, but if you come at every rhetorical situation aggressively, if you lead encounters with attacks, you push those who are leaning against you because they don't know any better into the arms of the people who are intractably your enemy.  You make more enemies.  And don't count on demographics to fix things; a minority can retain the majority of power for a long time.  If you back white (or other...oh, anti-black racism goes beyond white people) racists into a corner, if you don't offer an avenue for them to change, they're just going to fight harder against you.  They're just going to vote for more Trumps, for more Gerrymandering, for more mass incarceration; they're just going to fight harder to make sure you never get any power.  

You don't need to be everyone's friend, you don't need to cheer people up.  But if you're going to fight you need to be smart about it.  If you come at a white racist (who probably didn't burn your church, enslave your ancestors, or kill your leaders and hang their families; probably) full of accusations, they will stop listening to you immediately.  You will never, ever change their mind.  Do you continue to listen to someone who leads with talking about crime rates by race?  I'm gonna guess not.  But it doesn't matter if your mislaying of blame has fewer lies behind it than theirs, you're still mislaying blame.  And in doing so, you're still undermining everything else you try to do.

"Well done. Thank you, Vox. I hear racism is awful in the south. I hope it gets better.  
I live in Illinois, and I can say that there are groups of young men who carelessly and slowly walk across the street, not in the crosswalk, as your car is approaching. They do not seem to care about rules or respect. It just so happens that every time this happened to me, the disruptive persons were men who’s skin was rich with eumelanin pigments. 
   So in this case, the only people breaking pedestrian laws tended to have darker skin, representing maybe .3% of dark skinned population. 
It was cultural, not hereditary. 

I hate racism, I love all men the way Joshua (Jesus) tells me to, and I know that God made all humans in His likeness.  A few people tend to ruin life for the many. 
      I pray that all people will have grace to, “Love their neighbors as they love themselves.”",0.9148,192
"Well hold on now. How is the racial population relevant to the # cited by race? It doesn’t matter if it’s 99% whites living there, if all those white people drive cars...these facts are a little misleading..if more pedestrians are black this may not be race-related at all...just over zealous cop-related..",0.4019,66

Yet, the white community does indeed have a voice. You and your ancestors can get together and protest for selective outrageous things but have allowed this bigotry, racism and hate to continue for decades upon decades. Its because you secretive okay this behavior. Then you wonder why we want to be as far away from you as we can.",-0.8873,138

I just want to remind everyone not all cops are this way. My aunt is a single mother of three who is also a cop. I think some people become cops for the right reasons.

Okay, I’m ranting, stoping now.

the biggest problem is why is it that everytime a white officer encounter a young black man or black man in general de-escalate the situation listen to the tone in their voice they're trying to get a reaction this is why I encounter us so they can justify their reason for their brutality and they know they're white superiors will back them up,-0.6908,63

"“non stop brutality” WTF IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!!!!! almost every police officer is not racist- police brutality is different from being racist. Police brutality can be based off of racism but this is NOT brutality, it is more of abusing their powers. Should these two black males have been stopped? HELL NO- it’s not a big deal if you don’t walk across a crosswalk on a low traffic road like wtf. But if it was a major road then it would be understandable for him to stop them and just have a quick word but not threaten jail time or being given a citation. NOT ALL COPS ARE BAD- most of them are actually good but we still have laws we have to follow to ensure the safety of ourselves and our community as a whole. But the cops that are bad, racist, abuse their power, or brutally beat the person(s) they are arresting shouldn’t be police officers. Another thing is- If most of the pedestrian violations come from poor black communities, why can’t the police just give them a heads up and ACTUALLY tell them what they should do with pedestrian laws -especially when they have violated a law or rule. I think that if this officer stopped them to help them and just say “hey next time can you guys walk on the crosswalk so it can reduce your chances of being hit by a car that would be great, have a nice day” then these incidents wouldn’t happen as frequently",-0.9853,293
