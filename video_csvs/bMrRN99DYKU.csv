"Are you guys total idiots? Francia Raisa deserve  this award MORE than Selena! And I am not hating Selena, not saying that Selena is bad. I wish her all the best, happiness and health! But if you compare the two of them, what they did...wtf!? Can you even imagine what is like to risk your life to save another life? Without getting anything ?! Can you imagine what is like to give part of organs you need to another person? To put yourself into risk? You lack common biology knowledge and you are total ignorant. Don't know who is voting, I don't even want to know. The ones who voted or selected Selena not Raisa are fucking idiots, who care only about money and fame. What Frainca did is heroic, but obviously your stupid minds would never understand it. I wish the both girls all the best! No matter of this award- the two of them are much better humans than the idiots who stand behind the choice of this award.",0.9882,196

"Kayne West interrupts Taylor Swifts speech and everyone talks about that and not he fact that Taylor actually won. 
Selena Gomez thanks other for the prize she gets and everyone talks about the fact that she did that. 

What is wrong? Why not focus on the fact that the people winning the awards won an award instead of everything else that they say or don’t say or do or don’t do or what happened and didn’t happen? 

Kayne interrupts Taylor but Taylor won
Selena thanks a person for saving her life AND won. Let’s focus on that instead of everything else. (I know it was a while ago the Taylor thing happened but it’s an example)",0.9756,134

The whole world wouldnt be enough for her to love 😢,0.6369,11
"This beautiful and humble young lady has gone through some of the most troubling times in her life. It is one of the hardest things in the world to deal with something so serious as lupus, but on top of that, having to deal with the negative comments and hate that she deals with on a daily basis is very hard. One of the reasons I like her song Wolves a lot is because you know most people believe it is about a guy possibly Justin Bieber, but I think that it is not about a guy at all. If you look up the word Wolves in Latin, you actually get the word Lupus. Which is the disease that Selena went through for 5 years. I think that is why she loves the song so much too. Most people think that Francia should have won the award, well first of all she doesn't sing, but second I think that if given the opportunity she would give it to Selena because in the end, Selena has given back so much to this world and she never asked for anything in return. And Francia is just so kind that she would give it to Selena for no reason. She is such a kind soul that this award isn't enough to give this beautiful woman. Francia, on the other hand is the definition of a friend and a pure soul. She embodies the characteristics that I think all humans want in life, because I think it is easy to say that, yeah, I could donate a kidney, but the moment someone asks you for one, do you really think you could? These two woman are the reason why I try and find a friend who is as loving and giving as Francia and a friend who is humble and courageous as Selena. I love them both.",0.9979,339

"Why exactly is getting this award? Okay lady,we sympathise with the fact that you went through a tough year and you had lupus but godammit!This award was given to Madonna last year, the legend that she is. Madonna has multiple #1 singles, sold out world tours and is the reigning queen of pop. I mean seriously this title was given to women like Katy Perry, Rihanna, Beyonce,Britney Spears, they all brought something over the top,exciting interesting, and whatever it was, it was impressive, to the scene.With Selena the issue is that music is so fucking mediocre that it's just not worth it. I have sympathy for what's she's gone through as a human being but when you have women like Camila Cabello,Demi Lovato,Ariana Grange and Alicia Keys who are sickening and spectacular with their music giving a title such as woman of the year to Selena Gomez is so not worth it. Selena Gomez is probably the most manufactured and fake artists in the music industry. Selena Gomez is NOT a singer, she's beautiful YES! She's famous YES! She's a great actress YES! She's a great singer NO! Selena Gomez can't sing thats true. She doesn't deserve to even be seen as a singer. She's no singer, she's can't hit own notes, she's awful live. I Feel bad for her and the medical issues she had but not everybody's a winner in life lady toughen up! And f-you billboard for doing this bullshit.!",0.9826,283

I hope she gets positive vibes and comments because she deserves them and i will always love her no matter what, i learned so much from her and i will always do no matter what age i'm in.
