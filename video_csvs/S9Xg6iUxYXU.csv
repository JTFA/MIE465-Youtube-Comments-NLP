America is a multicultural nation with a vast array of musical art forms - very few of which were exhibited at this year's Scammy awards!  Bunk to this bunk!  I'd rather clean my toilet than listen to any of this excrement!  And let's face it, this did not occur because there was no musical talent other than cRappers and HipCrappers to exhibit, it happened because the leftist apologist liberal scum in charge of the LameStream media determined that only BlackMusicMatters!
