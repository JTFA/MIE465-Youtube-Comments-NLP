"Sad that pedro pascal wont be in the new season : ( . He was kinda the only reason for me to watch season 3. He just fits so well in the roll of a DEA agent. Im not sure if Ill watch the new season. The cast was great until now, because it wasnt that mainstream bullshit, but with the new cast from ""Star Wars"" and ""The Flash"", Im not really sure what will happen. I just hope its not one of these cases where everything gets ""Hip"" and its more like a documentary with dumb comedy frases. Overall Im really sad that Pedro Pascal is out, considering that the last Episode on season 3 submits that he will show up in season 4.",-0.4591,141
