To be quite honest I really think if razor makes this work I think that laptop with their phone as it's brain would be the future. The reason for that is because it's so convenient using your phone normally and then if you wanna use a PC and maybe play games on it you can use the laptop when you plop it in. Also all they gotta do is future proof it and basically if you want more power you would just need a stronger phone which maybe a win to some people's eyes because you get 2 upgrades for 1.,0.9134,104
