Hard to compare since Krispy kreme is so uniform in shape and texture. Personally I love their Lemon filled. But honestly I love most all filled donuts as long as they have a good amount of filling and the doughnut dough has just the right amount of chew. Actually I've tasted a few that could make Krispy Kreme 2nd or 3rd on my list.,0.9313,68

"I can't stand Krispy Kreme. They're too sweet, they're heavy, greasy, and you feel like crap after eating one. 
Home made is nice, but I just go to my local doughnut shop. They're less expensive, just the right amount of sweetness, and eating 2 or even 3 doesn't leave you feeling like you've made terrible life choices, unlike Krispy Kreme.

Dunkin' Donuts are a decent middle ground. They're sweeter than the local shop, but not nearly as oily and stomach brick like as Krispy Kreme. The donuts themselves tend to be a bit on the dry side, but I'm usually having tea with my donuts anyway so it's fine. They're also everywhere, so they're the most convenient.",0.8953,136

P.s. we love your videos  xd",0.8709,74
