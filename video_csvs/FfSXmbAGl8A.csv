"Behind the wheel against the road
Next to you the central coast
The central thought within my mind
Is how to stay within these lines, but still be free

Beneath the ground the giants sleep
And maybe we're just in their dreams
The setting sun with every turn
Above the ground the oak trees burn
And they weep for rain
And for this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars

A pocket knife, an old guitar
Coffee cup, a deck of cards
Corre corre dashboard feet
Flashlight children by the stream

A box of books, a book of rocks
One for the birds, one for the knots
That I will learn how to tie
Around this day to keep my life
From sliding away

From this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars
A little wood to keep it burning
Fascinated by it all

The first awake will stoke the coals
The early morning river rolls
The last one in the swing will break
Stones will stack, the kids will make
Those lines

Roxaboxen by the creek
Candle lights began to speak
Words are broken, smoke signals that will leads us into the light
Into it all
And always

Always endless conversations
Implicated by the stars
A little wood to keep it burning
Fascinated by it all
And always",0.7964,224

"Hello,
Thank you for your comment and concerns in regards to the fire scenes in Jack‚Äôs Big Sur video. Please note that the fire scenes were not shot on the beach in Big Sur, they were filmed at another location near where the director lives. Regardless we understand your concern and are writing to let you know that we will be taking down the original video and replacing it with an edited version with the fires removed in the next few days.


Please know we did not intend to upset anyone and apologize if it felt like we were being insensitive to the Big Sur community. Big Sur holds a special place in our hearts. Jack and his wife Kim take yearly camping trips to the area and have made previous donations to the Big Sur fire relief efforts.

"Hey, also, next time, try chillin with the locals & get to know us before you blow up an already heavily exploited, last bit of pristine land we are all trying to conserve, protect and maintain...don't coop yourself up in Post Ranch or Ventana for $5000 grand a night and avoid us.

We already get millions of visitors a day, 85% of which block up our ONE highway north and south, mindless, careless common-senseless tourists. Don't you know how it is? Or have you been avoiding the public as much as you can thanks to the millions of dollars you have? Wow, at least donate a dollar to the fire brigade or to the people who lose their homes, their whole lives, everything they have to clueless illegal fire starters. THANKS FOR NOTHING.
