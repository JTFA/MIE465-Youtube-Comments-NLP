"Gaurav Pandey could it be in relation to the other buildings in view?

Like when backing away from the building, other buildings to the sides of you begin to appear in your field of view, allowing comparison of the buildings that you didn’t have before. 

Maybe it has to do with elevation. You or the building might be higher in elevation, causing some visual tricks as you get closer or back away (getting higher or lower as you do)

It could also be a Cinderella’s castle effect. When you’re far away, the castle seems huge, but in fact it isn’t at all, so when you’re up close to it, you notice the details of it that you couldn’t see from far away, and you realize it’s actually a miniature castle.

Try isolating just the building, by covering up everything else (look through a hole) and see if you get the same effect. You shouldn’t, because angular perception is always consistent. It’ll be other things around the building that cause optical illusions.",0.1531,211
