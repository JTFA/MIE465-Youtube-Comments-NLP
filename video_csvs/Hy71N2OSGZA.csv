I would like to know how much time the MBUX will be supported by updates over the air. We all know that Mercedes is totally ignoring customer’s complaints about missing of CarPlay/Android Auto in a lot of recent sold cars that costs over 50k $. I suggest MB to include in the car’s contract the exact date the updates will be shut-down because of new models.,-0.5198,75

But you are about the video interfaces are releasing)) Better run a full autopilot, because even such an unprofessional company as Tesla released it on the roads. And is not afraid of reputational and financial losses from potential force majeure situations. with respect...;)

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us in English. Your S-Class is probably equipped with one of our most innovative systems which is the Driving Assistance Package. It's surely something different from what we present in the video but we believe it's also a very big step that proves our technological expertise. We understand your needs and we're working more on autonomous driving so we encourage you to stay tuned for more info on our new projects. Maybe you'll be able to enjoy some new features on your S-Class in the future. 😉,0.9419,99

This is excellent. Really good job on this Mercedes. I think this looks set to be the industry leader in this department. The only sad thing is that the beautiful large screens will always be optional with the small basic screens looking silly surrounded by vast expanses of plastic. That's unfortunate. The design should always first be based on a basic model (since that is what most people get) and then the fancy options should enhance what already looks good. It shouldn't only look good if highly specced with base models looking cheap and silly. I will miss the rotary wheel as well however. It gives nice tactile feedback while on the move.,0.939,124
