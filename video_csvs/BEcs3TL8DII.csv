What harden is doing in the ""Western"" conference is remarkable. Lebron plays in a much weaker conference with more shooters around him. No team in nba history has had 5 starters that have shot atleast over 35% from 3 multiple times in their career. Only cavs have that. So what? We say lebron pads stats?

"I don't watch your show or videos. Max is a sellout liberal lunatic. Molly just nother racist muslim and sas, smh uncle fucking tom!",-0.8687,28
"I guess it depends what MVP really means.
Lebron james increased his totaly FG % by 8%.  He is just way better then he was before.
He is playing some insane defense and he is taking less shots.
His efficiency is way better and he's scoring more points with less shots.
He is shooting 25-50% LESS free throws then any of the last 14 seasons.
JAMES HARDEN TAKES MORE THEN TWICE THE AMOUNT OF 3. that lebron takes and he shoots about 3.5 times more then lebron per game.
If you use that same efficiency with more shots and assume lebron will get the calls he does later on in the season....LBJ would be averaging 35 points straight up.
However, he is picking which teams to play good defense on.  In just half of a game lebron james got 5 steals and shoot 78% from the field.  

Lebron is the best player in the league right now.  It's that simple.

MVP wise....The houston wouldn't do anywhere near as good without harden. Harden doesnt do well like lebron every year.
So Harden stands out more.
You guys have to understand that Lebron james is basically leading the league in shooting efficiency.  Deandre jordan with that 63%+ fg is just shooting 2's.   60% 2's is similar to 40% 3's

Lebron is 59%...........................................

Harden taking mroe then double the amount of Lebrons 3s.

So of course harden has more points.  His team is used to harden being the play maker and carrier.  So he will lead in assist.

The one thing that makes Harden weak is his defense.  That's really it.

One of these 2 have to win. If anyone else wins i will ignore MVP from now on.  

The sad thing is most NBA players are not too educated and they dont critically think.  LEBRON james is not only having one of the best seasons of his career but i dont think you'll ever see any other play in the history of basketball to be this efficient on shooting, making plays, AND play hard defense. You will NEVER see that again.

Harden...you'll see plenty of players who will turn into an offensive goat.
Think of Kobe and all the great scorers minus MJ.  They are all volume shooters and this is why Hardens % is low.

Harden however, is leading the league in most 3's made and he is shooting 40% from the field.  3% less thenlebron but he shots the ball more.

Honestly, if you want to talk shit about lebron.  Talk shit about how he passes so much and doesnt shoot the ball enough.
At this point.....being a ball hog is actually a good thing for lebron.

its funny because last year it was an award LeBron didn't care about. everyone on ESPN was saying how meaningless the mvp had become .the second it look like someone other than LeBron might win it the mvp became just a regular season award . now a quarter of a season and we are back on the LeBron d train because he is a mvp candidate so far. this is the REAL reason LeBron has so many haters . not because of his so called greatness.,0.8016,90

"love how max wants to give it to lebron even though he thinks brady doesnt deserve MVP over wentz. Harden has the most points and is on one of the top 2 teams in the NBA. Wentz has the most touchdowns and is on one of the top 2 teams in the NFL.  similarities between Lebron and Brady? Older players having some of their best seasons yet who have are one of the top 3 teams in the league and have managed to ascend their teams to impressive wining streaks. PROOF Max is biased as fuck and not a true analyst, literally wants to give it to Lebron who s doing the Exact same things as Brady, and wont acknowledge Harden who is doing exactly what Wentz is doing even though he said ""Wentz is the clear MVP"". Dude needs to stop being such a bitch and admit he doesnt know what hes talking about.",0.7627,166
"seriously ?? Harden?? give your heads a shake....what lebrons doing without Kyrie and without IT is incredible he has the best stats of he carreer up until this point of the season and not to mention he's in his 15th year!? who really cares that youre tired of seeing him win, bunch of baby milllenials want to give it to Harden because everyone should win it should be fair bla bla cry me a river, who cares who got snubbed or didn't get snubbed were talking THIS year thats all that matters, no one cares Lebrun got snubbed in 2011 and and possibly 2013 .. .",0.8668,115
