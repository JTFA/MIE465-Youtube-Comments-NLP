"""I'm an open book."" Such bull. When story broke, dude tried to make it look like it was people speculating and jumping to conclusions. 

I don't think he's sorry because he got caught, he's sorry because he's trying to protect his brand (and he should protect his money). I personally don't think he should have talked about this publicly even if it was out there, he only owes her an explanation. The hell what others think. However, he makes it sound like he slipped into someone else accidentally. He doesn't have to be the ""perfect man"", just a decent person. Not cheating or beating your significant other is the easy part of being in any relationship, it doesn't make you perfect when you do what is expected of you. 

Either way, I hope he keeps killing it; making that money. I hope his relationship can survive this and he isn't all talk about changing. Not because of what it will do to his pockets or because of what people will say, but for him and his family. 

When in doubt, follow the golden rule people. If you wouldn't like it being done to you, don't do it to them.",0.4352,230

Good luck with making it last though. It will always be in the back of her mind. Once that ultimate trust has been broken it can never be replaced. That’s just fact. I give her credit for staying with him after cheating but I would never be able to stay with someone who cheated on me.
