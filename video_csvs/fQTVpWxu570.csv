"I know full well who they are, that's the shitty part. This song takes DC from emotional hardcore to sounding like your local indie folk band from 2014 who sing about the weather and ""I feel it in my ribs"". Don't get me wrong, the band is free to evolve, I'm just so bored of the pentatonic scale and Mumford and Sons-style backing vocals, and pioneering a genre doesn't hold you above criticism. You might like it, you might not, but you have to admit it's kind of derivative and kind of bullshit.",-0.4995,105
