"All this. I don't really care who Rey's parents were. And I liked a lot about this movie--the moral grayness and different interpretations of the same event, for example, and the ""burn the past"" attitude of Kylo Ren. However, most of it only works in the first part of a trilogy. Having the second part ""throw away the past,"" including the movie that directly led up to it, was confusing and felt like a slap in the face. In many ways, this would have been a great Episode VII to reboot the franchise with. But as an Episode VIII, it was painful. And that's not even counting the actual plot holes and seeming story inconsistencies in the thing. Just the general attitude of sh**ting on the prior movie shows how hodge podge they are in building this franchise.

Totally disagree, the purpose from the first film to now seems doll. Yes I get it balance to the force but there are so many alternative ways to make it more interesting.

"I think you have, perhaps inadvertently , proved that the criticisms of this movie are mostly valid. Star Wars is a continuing story set in an established universe, and there was already a first chapter in this specific story. There was no way to predict many of the things that happened in this movie because there was no precedent for those things in the previous movie, and all of the Star Wars universe. It's  bad storytelling.Really bad, actually. This isn't how you tell stories. You don't introduce a mysterious character and then kill them in the middle of the movie and shrug your shoulders. You don't take what is the hero's main emotional drive of their  life, and then shrug that away a few moments later.  They were able to get away with this, because, let's face it, even though Star Wars is a well-known, money generating franchise, the percentage of people that really care about Star Wars enough to be irked by breaking the already established rules about how this universe works, and the extremely poor story continuity with the previous movie,  is relatively small. 

If you separate this movie from its expectations, and watch it like that, it is an entertaining movie with some  problems, it's, imo, pretty good.  You can't, critically, do that though, it is supposed to be a part of a giant story. I think the average of the critic and fan reaction is probably about right. C+/B-",-0.9709,278
"I thought that the movie was beautifully shot (apart from the weird horse cgi and milking scene), so on that front, I understand the praise from critics. 
However, the plot itself is messy. Logic seems to have been completely thrown out the window. I defended Rey a lot after watching TFA when friends called her a Mary-Sue, but I couldn't keep that defence for TLJ - the plot is literally over a day? A few days? And yet she can lift a fuck ton of rocks, when it takes Luke properly training with Yoda to lift just one. Supposedly this is because the force has to be in balance, but why didn't this happen with Luke? He was up against a sith master and apprentice as well, but he didn't magically develop all of his powers within that short a time scale. It's just annoying. 
And as Mat said, there were no pay offs to storylines set up in the force awakens. Why should we be excited about a franchise, when the famous 'Star Wars twist' is essentially disappointment? I feel like this would have been ok - especially considering the meaning of Rey's parentage is to show that anyone can be special, you don't have to be a Skywalker - except the rest of the movie was just all over the place. Why didn't Holdo tell everyone the plan? What is the point of Finn and Rose? I love Benicio deal Toro, but what was the point of his weird character than to show the morally grey area of war, when it didn't even pay off, and everyone saw it coming? If everyone can go into light speed and smash massive ships, why don't they have kamikaze units? (Their whole fleet basically died at the beginning of the film, so it makes not difference either way whether they are kamikaze on purpose or not - although it does depend on the type of ship) Why was Luke so out of character? 
In stories where there is a reluctant hero (Luke), there is usually an inciting incident about 1/4 of the way through the story which causes them to change their mind and help. This did not happen with Luke. He was just snarky and - essentially just took up screen time (don't worry, I hate myself for writing that too) - expressing ideas that could have been shown visually much better for about 3/4 of the film, until the 'inciting incident' (Yoda) makes him decide to help. I understand there are variations on the trope of the reluctant hero, but I just felt it was badly done.
I also don't understand the moral message of the film - they were trying to push morally grey ideas, which I felt was really good for the tone of the film if it had been darker (shown in the scenes with rey and Kylo, which were the best in the film), but at the same time shoving ideas down our throats - AKA Roses 'rescue' of Finn 'for love' which could have resulted in the deaths of everyone (also why didn't the AT-AT's just shoot them while they were running back to the base?). So many messages being shoved down the viewers throats, that were kind of badly written. Ok, maybe I need to chill on this point though, lol. 
Basically, it was a beautiful film, but overall - as another commenter put it - it was spectacle over substance. I felt like meaning had been taken away from characters that we had connected with over years. The format of Luke's death was pretty much pointless, Leia's flying moment (had been excited to see her use her powers, but in the film canon, I'd always liked that her power mostly came from her intellect and leadership), the let down of Rey's parents, and Luke's character.
I know I sound like a toxic fan, but I think it's okay to criticise the film, as long as you can also see its merit. In a lot of ways I'm just glad they are making more Star Wars films, because even if they annoy me, I do enjoy them in the end (even if it takes a long time).",0.9943,796
"I thought the movie was fine. But then I'm just a casual Star Wars fan, had watched no theories, and had literally no expectations going in.

So when he says that your parents are just drunks, you take that with a grain of salt, knowing that he is most likely lying about it.

It sounds pretty dumb to be actually pissed off by a movie sequel, but it is equally, if not even more dumb to berate people who are thinking critically (if sometimes not really precisely) about the media. As long as there is an effort to improve rigor in the analysis, I can see no reason why would it be bad to review things from an outside perspective. If you say that people are dumb so we should make decisions for them, and tell what they should like and approve, you don't get a flourishing culture, but an autocracy.

"Okay, am I seriously one of the only few people that liked the movie? I thought that it did a good job with what it had, and I enjoyed the directions it took and the directions it took. 

I loved seeing Yoda destroy the Jedi Tomes, as I saw it being symbolic for the title of the movie. The Last Jedi. Luke was the last Jedi of the OLD AGE, which has come to an end. Now here comes Rei, who is literally the last Jedi, who must teach those out there how to control their abilities in their own way. 
I loved the fact that Rei's parents were nobodies, as it makes her seem more unique in my eyes and stand out more. If she had turned out to be the child of someone from the previous films, then she more than likely would have had extremely high standards forced upon her, standards that she never would have been able to surpass in the eyes of the fanbase. 
I loved every second of this film, because I could see that the creators were putting their all into in in order to make it a good one.",0.9586,216

"Rey is boring because she never loses to anyone, even Luke, despite only having just picked up a lightsaber for the first time within maybe a week of finding Luke.

I really, really want to like her, but She’s insufferable. I love Finn, he’s a fun character. Kylo Ren is great. Han was great. Luke was done dirty though.

Imagine if Luke beat Yoda in a saber duel the first time he met him in Empire. It’s no different.",0.964,98

"SPOILER WARNING I loved the movie when I watched it in theatres. What disappointed me about it was that it seemed to deliberately shoot down everyone’s theories by tossing out all of the Chekhov’s guns. “Who is Supreme Leader Snoke?” Doesn’t matter anymore. “Who are Rey’s parents?” Dead junkies. Rey’s connection to Luke’s lightsaber now seems needlessly ambiguous and arbitrary. And the whole story itself felt weak and misplaced, as if the writer was like, “Yeah, let’s do this because cool!” And, let’s be honest, the whole plot hinges on the Resistance ships being faster and out of reach of the First Order’s guns for accurate fire, yet somehow the First Order is suddenly able to accurately destroy the transport ships headed for Crait (which I don’t know why they made it sound like Krayt.) I didn’t like the casino scenes at all. It didn’t feel like a Star Wars environment. The script just felt subpar in regards to what Force Awakens and Rogue One brought us to expect. I couldn’t emotionally connect to it as much as I could the other two. Also, PLOT BOULDERS. But despite all this, I still loved it and it’s still Star Wars. Just not as good as I had hoped it would be.",-0.6695,270

"Science can eat it cause I watched shitloads of theories including yours and not only did I love the movie, I actually preferred it  because it was so much better from a thematic and narrative standpoint.  Literally the only thing I hated on your list of things I was supposed to hate was the Leia thing and that's cause it just felt like such a copout.

As a side point if you really read into what the movies have been saying from a thematic standpoint they are telling a story of fate being broken.  Of history repeating itself and turning out differently.",-0.8654,107

"The problem is not the theories, it's why this theories exists in the first place. Episode VII was a pure garbage, the work of a mediocre tv showrunner who thinking it's was the new spielberg. The original premise, a repetition of the contexte of the OT was already a bullet on the foot, then, the slightest tentative of possibly working idea was butchered to fit into this pointless remake of the episode IV. From bad to worse it also inclued the JJ trademarks, the infamous ""mystery box"" narration that drove the Lost viewers on the verge on insanity. 

This theories was not only the raw consequences of abrams honeypot trap of a plot, it was also a cry for help. A hopeless try to make sense of the movie, a desperate wish that, maybe, the next movie will fix everything, even make this one good in return. They begging Ryan Johnson to save the postlogie, he look down and whisper : ""No""

The Last Jedi is a cinematographic troll. Every aspect of the film is build to trigger anyone who watch it. The Alt-right, the old UE fanboy, the OT fanboy, the VII lovers, the theorist lovers, the consistensy addict, everyfuckingone. It's not a brillant deconstruction of the Star Wars mytho, it's a work of pure destruction. One third is a giant middle finger to abrams work, one third is loose part of V and Vi, finally the last one is just plain emptiness. 

Maybe johnson was incompetent too, maybe he just hated Star wars or maybe he told himself that the postlogie was doomed from the start and it's was futile of trying to fix it. So he goes full joker, take a flamethrower, burn evrything to the ground, watch laughing then pack all the ashes and sends it to JJ. 
 
At the end all that left is the void, a even greater one that at the end of the VII et some pity for abrams who to conclued what never really begin et should ever be made in the first place.

PS: Rogue One was good. It give me back hope that in 201X it's possible to make a good Star Wars Movie.",-0.963,412
"The problem is that we unconsciously assume that the movie-makers will look at the story to the level of detail we look at them from. We piece together the details and assume that we know what will happen if we pieced those details together correctly. And that is true IF the story-makers are looking at their own lore to the level we're looking at it from.  We come up with these theories and predictions without taking into account the idea that they might not notice the things we've noticed. They may not see what we see, but we assume that they've consciously masterminded every little detail and are going in a similar direction that our reasoning has taken us to make the theories. 

At the end of the day (and we may not want to believe this) we may very well be paying more care and attention to the lore of the franchises we theorize about than the ones who actually make and OWN said franchises.

The theories will only be correct if the movie makers are trying to make masterpieces. If they're only trying to do what will earn them the most money, then that isn't their biggest priority.",0.9231,212

"You don't actually buy this shit do you? pardon my french.  The reason people hated The Last Jedi were all over the place, but here's a good place to start:  Disney didn't just disappoint us by not using our theories, they effectively gave the worst possible answers to questions raised in The force Awakens.  For example, Snoke is reduced to a silly joke, the map Luke left, suggesting he wanted to be found, was contradicted by his pessimistic personality, and Rey's parent's turned out to be no one significant.  Quite honnestly, even some of the worse theories would have been more interesting than what we got, and what we got seemed like a middle finger to the fans.",-0.1024,133

but no matter how you do it, bad research or not: you can not do it right. you just can't. either you predict it wrong and get hate afterwards because you confidently blasted such bullshit into the internet -  or you predict it right and still get hate because maybe you confidently predicted stuff that most Star Wars fanboys would disagree with.

I'm antisocial the few people who I do hang out with on or offline don't care to tell me about movies my group ain't about that when I am playing games, it's usually single player so I don't get a lot of chances to be spoiled and whatever spoiling tactics you employ upon me will unless it is a phone of your theories in front of my face will most likely be forgotten within days. to put it over simply I'm a juggernaut tell me everything you want about the movie you cherish and love to spoil to all but it will be replaced by my swirling tornados of ideas in my mind its how I tick. my spoiler evasion is a trait, not a learned ability at least I'm unsure it can be learned or not all I'm truly sure of is any spoilers you give me are swept up in my thoughts never to be seen again or until I actually try to remember it.",-0.2138,184
