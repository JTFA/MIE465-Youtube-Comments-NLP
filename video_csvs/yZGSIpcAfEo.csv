"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!
Repent of your sins and put your faith in The Lord. 

He loves you more than you think or even believe! 

He is not angry at you, so please don't believe the devil's lies. 

The Lord came down from heaven to die for me and you, and rose the 3rd day to redeem us back to God. He Himself is willing to do such an Act to save us! This alone speaks volumes of His Love towards us. 

He does not promise an easy life as a Christian, in fact He tells us to expect trying times and tribulations, especially for His Name Sake, since this world is going to hate you for having faith in Him. What He does promise is Free Salvation in Him, and paradise in the world to come. There will be no more death or even crying!

Receive the Kingdom now by receiving Jesus in your heart! 
He promises that He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so don't let anyone stop you from coming to Jesus! 

Time is short, judgement is approaching fast, and Jesus is the Only Way to escape. So please call upon The Lord in Truth today, if you haven't already! You WILL be saved!

Shalom, friends.",0.9769,245
