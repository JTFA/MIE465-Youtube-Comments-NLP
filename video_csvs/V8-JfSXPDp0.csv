I know that  sounds phony but seriously true.  I got a blood blister on my finger for trying to see how much pull with a Craftsman socket and snap! OOOOuch !   One thing to be careful of is that these magnets are very brittle if some heavy metal comes in contact with it it can break apart the magnet.,0.7983,100
