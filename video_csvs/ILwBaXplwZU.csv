"*Short explanation:* The sun appears to move up and down every day, but the entire time the flat edge of the blinds stay pointing at the sun, as the blinds are tilted. 
*Long explanation:*
There are two ways to think of it. One involves lines and stuff, while the other involves a cylinder.
I'll start with the longest way. 
You have a flat 2x2 unit square laying on the ground. You prop the square up on an edge such that the angle between the square and the ground is 45 degrees. 

Kind of looks like this from the side:
 _____\_____

If you take two points, one from the midpoint of the side on the ground and one from the midpoint of the opposite side, and draw a line that includes those two points, the line will rise one unit upward for every one unit traveled horizontally, i.e. the slope of the line is 1 (because tangent(45 degrees)=1).

However, take a point form a corner of the edge on the ground and a point from the corner farthest from the first point (i.e. opposite to the first corner), and draw a line using those two points. Going from the ground to the edge of the square, both lines rise by the same amount (the square root of 2 units, to be exact). However, the first line going down the middle of the square travels less distance horizontally to reach that height than the line going from one corner to the other.  Because the line going from corner to corner (the second line) travels more distance horizontally to reach the same vertical height as the line going through the middle of the sides (the first line), the slope of the second line is less than the slope of the first line.

Now, from each line, travel the same distance along each line, starting from where the line intersects with the ground. One point is higher than the other, yet the line extending from both points are in line with the surface of the square.  Since the Sun is pretty much always the same distance from the Earth over the course of one day, these two points are an accurate  representation of what happens in reality.


*Short way to think about it:*
Take a cylinder, and slice it in half at an angle. Ta-da.

Both explanations essentially describe the same thing.",0.8338,466

"A rotating plane will remain oriented only if it is normal to its rotational axis. A plane normal to Earth's rotational axis will only intersect the sun at the equinoxes.

"Depending on the ecology in your area, usually juniper populations are too overgrown and condensed, pushing out native grasses and sages that should be adding to the soil and resisting erosion.

True the scale isn’t doable to scale but it is real. Notice in the vid the light source was closer than the spherical, so it was dishonest. 

The CE is not a true phenomenon, imo. There are plenty of demonstrations for you to watch. One thing to consider is this. The spherical system is closed and is not detectable. The CE would debunk this if it were true. That is, is the spherical system able to be empirically detected or not. You can’t have it both ways.

The earth could be almost any shape as long as it is the SUN that is moving on a plane and in a circular/ovoid shape around the earth. Well, it also has to be large enough and located close enough to the plane of the observer.... but the point is that what matters is the path of the sun, NOT the shape of the earth. 
The reason it works like it does with our system is because the rotation of the approximately-spherical earth makes the sun APPEAR to move around it in a plane passing through the earth.

"Paragraph i wrote for flat earthers myself
(Unless you know alot of their arguments it wont make alot of sense)

What do NASA have to gain from lying about the shape of earth.
Dont say money because if the earth was flat they would sell flat earth models instead of globe ones so they would make the same amount of money as they are now, so its not money. Also it would cost more to make a giant hologram and try to lie forever, we knew the shape of the earth long before nasa.
Its not that it would prove science fake they dont care about that if it was told to be flat then scientists would invest in figuring out how a flat earth works instead of a globe.
How does water stick to a globe you ask? Well this thing called gravity which pulls everything to the core and the ground of the earth.
The moon landing wasnt faked because proper CGI was invented until 1971 or 72  even then it was only 2D they still hadnt developed 3D.
Infact i still havnt seen a proper picture of a flat earth i see one every now and then but its so inconsistent i havnt seen the same picture twice. And when i do see a picture its like a cartoon or an illustration its not a satellite photo
Just because you see a spread out picture of a map on a logo doesnt mean its flat they are just showing the globe flattened so you can see all the countries.
You guys post pictures of the horizon and call it proof but compared to the size of the earth the horizon is nothing, it means nothing you can only see curve from very high up.
Also some people are now saying its neither flat nor round, dont even get me started on you guys, its definitely one or the other.
If there was an ice wall wouldn't everyone be very familiar with it by now, and since when did nasa become highly trained soldiers who dedicate their life to defending a wall, i still have yet to see the same pic of the wall twice its all different and inconsistent  again, just like the flat earth. Also how did this giant magic wall even get there? And why doesn't it melt?
Also if it was flat the sun would shine on all the earth at once and it doesn't so explain that.
They say taxation is theft when in reality tax pays for alot of stuff we use daily such  as roads, the fire departments police departments hospitals, basically any public surface maybe there are some problems with it here and there but it is totally necessary to run a country.
Flat earthers only argument when they can't explain something is ""CGI"" or just saying its fake, we knew the earth was round a long time before NASA came around and there is alot more space companies than NASA are they all lying too?
And when you guys say gravity doesn't exist it is literally the stupidest thing ever, or so i thought, then i found out most of you dont believe in Australia or New Zealand, my cousin lives in New Zealand FFS and my friend has family in Australia how can you just not believe in an entire 2 countries?
Also please explain sun rise and sun set.
""But if the wall doesn't exist how come no one can get to Antarctica"" simple answer......they can loads of people have been to Antarctica and taken photos, where do you think the penguins are?
So tell me, why would NASA lie to us?
Why would they put so much effort into trying to cover it up and photoshopping every photo?
Why would they make a giant hologram, why would they even bother to pretend other planets exist if they dont? 
Why would they lie about having a moon and the size or distance of the sun? Surely it doesn't matter to them how big or far away the sun is.
So riddle me that please one of you harcore flat earthers.

Also if we didnt spin a day would be 6 months long and a night would also be 6 months long and they aren't are they?

"Your slat only forms a planar ring if the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the slat's surface. This is probably the case with your blinds during winter months where the combination of the sun being relatively low in the sky and your latitude causes this to be the case. In summer months, the sun will get really high in the sky at midday, requiring a steeper slat angle relative to the ground, which corresponds a ring of a conical shape. The conical shape causes a slat set to have minimal shadow at noon to create a larger shadow as time moves on.",0.0,110

"i am not sure I buy ur theory.  the way u explain it it makes sense, but in rea;ity that is NOT WHATS HAPPENING.

the sun is actually NOT tracking horizontal in relation to the window blinds.  close but it is actually going up, 1,2, or three blinds higher.

the difference is small, so the WIDTH OF THE SHADOW IS SMALL, IT ISNT AS NOTICABLE SINCE THE SHADOW IS NOT IN FOCUS SO THERE IS NO SHARP LINE TO MEASURE.



BUT TO NOT RECOGNIZEthat the sun is below the horizon, and the blinds are kinda parallel to that same horizon is kinda on the basic of understanding... at least in my basic logic...
