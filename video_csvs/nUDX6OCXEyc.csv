If you put you turtles in the pond you need to put a solid wall around the pond to keep them in it the wall needs be about 2 t 3 feet tall. Just talk to Kenan from Kamp Kenan.He is a good man and know his turtles and love to teach.,0.8271,54

OMG!!THIS IS AMAZING!!Good Job!! I ♡ IT! I used to own a turtle that we found on the streets bc we live by a pond so we would always find squished baby turtles on the street. :( But then one day we found one that wasn't squished! So we kept it and took it home. :D,0.5108,68
Oh wow it looks so good!! I just wish that they would’ve used some thinner rocks on the side because there could have been quite a bit more water space for the fish + turtles in my opinion. But still. A very good job 👌👌👌,0.9416,53

Vendor walked off site before completing the full scope of project & refused to address our concerns!  And now Aquascape & Greg Wittstock refuse to address their builders negligence or do anything even though I have a promise in writing...& he is out here promoting his CACs, so he trains, promotes & markets them but he won't back his work!",-0.3643,161
