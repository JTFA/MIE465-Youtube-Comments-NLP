Sense you spend so much time trying to look like a barbie goddess. Here's advice for girls. Stop putting your hair back at all. It does in fact stretch your scalp and makes your forehead larger. Men do not find this an attractive quality in a girl. Short hair like a guys is more attractive than a large forehead.,0.8225,65
