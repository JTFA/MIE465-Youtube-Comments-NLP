"+el jay Don't get me wrong. I don't love him. I was also pretty against him because all the mainstream news outlets and European politicians made him out to be such a bad guy because of his ""human rights abuses.""

So I believed that most Filipinos would also hate him. But after talking to a lot of native Filipinos, I feel like the majority of the country actually wanted heavy change to kill off the corruption. His method of policing is basically like chemo.

And now I'm reading more news from WaPo and BBC and stuff of him really working to rebuild the country with large scale projects such as the Japanese one. Think of him as a really heavy-handed but strong minded politician who wants to basically restructure the country. So it's no wonder why he hates the European/western ""sissy"" governing which tries to appease everyone including criminals, right? Why can't people who poison millions of innocents on a daily basis while absorbing all the money for themselves be put to death?

Again, I'm not worshiping him and I can see why people don't like him. But I think saying that he's evil is wrong.",-0.9168,218
