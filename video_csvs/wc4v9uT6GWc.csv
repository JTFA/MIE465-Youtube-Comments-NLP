"AN EVENING PRAYER
By Mel Tillis

If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one foot to go stray
If I have walked in my own wilful way
Dear Lord forgive

If I have uttered idle words or vain
If I have turned aside from want or pain
Lest I offend some other through the strain
Dear Lord forgive

If I have been perverse or hard or cold
If I have longed for shelter in the fold
When thou hast given me some fort to hold
Dear Lord forgive

Forgive the sins I have confessed to thee
Forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide me, love me and my keeper be
Dear Lord forgive, Amen!",0.7959,124

He was Terry Bradshaw's buddy. They took a bag of Doritos and about 6 cases of beer for their trip to California in that primerd down Monte Carlo :-) ""Do we have enough ice for all this beer?""- Terry Bradshaw. ""Plenty""- Mel Tillis. ""Did you bring enough food son?""- Terry Bradshaw. Mel Tillis pulls out a bag of Doritos ""Plenty"" :-) He will be missed.",0.8152,128

Put in to perspective he is a true artist that didn't  need auto tune or big flashy stages and stupid ass videos. He didn't blow up Twitter or Facebook. He was a genuine singer and songwriter and he was 100 % real. So you idiots can actually thank pioneers like this in the music industry that made the climb the hard way.",0.9161,85
