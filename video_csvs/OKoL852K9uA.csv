All ice will do is close your pours better...which after you wash your face with warm water you should splash cold on it anyway to close your pours. Then use a primer like Physicians Formula. It helps your make up go on great and smooth. Jus sayin..,0.8779,53

"Ice sounds like it would be very short term for tightening your pores because your skin naturally warms with movement throughout the day. Also, just for future reference and anyone wanting to try this, doctors recommend not applying ice straight to your skin for prolonged periods of time, so use a Ziploc back or something (plus this fixes the whole ""ice melts"" thing lol), and don't let the ice sit on your delicate face skin for too long or else you will get some damage! Side note: this video was a cute little experiment lol looking forward to watching more of your videos.",0.8046,115
