"Exactly! A lot of the ingredients like honey, yogurt, sugar, lemons etc are accessible but the harder ingredients are easy to get ahold of! I got the beeswaax and cocoa butter from amazon - they come in HUGE bags so you can make tons of product. You can find a the oils and such on Amazon or at your local grocery store (I went to whole foods) and Mountain Rose Herbs is a great resource for anyone looking for lavender powder etc :) Hope you guys still got something out of the video. Thanks for watching :)",0.9888,106

"For all of you natural skincare lovers out there, let me recommend the best cleanser ever: Honey. It makes your skin SUPER soft and glowy and it is surprisingly easy to wash off. It has fantastic moisturizing and antibacterial properties which are great for blackheads and dull skin. I was my face with honey every day and to do so you just massage a decent amount in for about 2-3 minutes until it doesn't look gloopy, but like your face is wet. Then just was it off with some cold/lukewarm water and your done!!",0.9552,105

"Hi Harlie! I actually haven't given it a good go yet! I've tried it once and found it a little too dewy for my oily skin. It's very luminous with sheer coverage - so if you're into that, I think you'll really like it. Sorry if this isn't very helpful but I do LOOOOVE burt's beees new blushes and the lipsticks! (and obvs obsessed with original lip balm it's my holy grail)",0.2295,80
Hi Mi. Would it be ok if you used liquid honey instead of hard honey and then maybe put the scrub or mask in the fridge to harden a bit??? Thanks,0.6416,35
"Hi, I am from Canada and the winters dry up my skin so bad that at night when I use moisturizer my skin burns. I started using raw oat, honey and cold compressed coconut oil. It works like magic. The oat works as a gentle exfoliate and heals the skin as well.

For summers I just rub a slice of tomato. It works like lemon but it's gentle than lemon.",0.7273,78

"Try adding a soft or liquid oil to your lip balm and it will make a world of difference, waxes and hard oils are great for protecting your skin but you need a liquid oil to moisturize. You can reheat what you have already made and just mix in a softer oil, I recommend coconut, argan or apricot kernel.",0.6808,64
Try adding some hyaluronic acid into the toner as well.,0.2732,11

Yes! Raw honey is great because it's unprocessed. You can definitely use a more liquidy honey and leave it in the fridge. I've actually been keeping my honey mask in the fridge because it keeps the texture nice and solid and also feels SOOOOO good and soothing. Thanks for watching!,0.9656,55
