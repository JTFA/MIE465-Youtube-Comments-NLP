"Ian Mignone I know but like 1 or 2 of their songs sound like this. I really love this type and you can check those songs out I think they are 8 years Ikr, I'm not sure.",0.9061,40
"Ian Mignone maybe a better way to say it is he used to see a completely different side of the band and their skill set with each album release now we get this watered down pop version. I understand it's more appealing to a broader audience and I still think it's some of the best music being made and by far the best being played on the radio but go back and listen to New Orleans or shade, it feels like they're on a slightly higher level then some of their more modern stuff",0.8779,96
"Ian Mignone of course it's not near as poppy and much more unique. Also you're forgetting Church mouth and it's complicated being a wizard both albums were released in between waiter and censored colors. Don't get me wrong American ghetto is a phenomenal album from top to bottom I love the subtle hip-hop influence but I like the Beats from It's Complicated being a wizard even more. Church mouth as an album has a backwoods Rough Around the Edges feel with even a country twang at times. Waiter had a dark Progressive vibe especially for 2005/06 nobody was making music like that. Censored colors was a masterpiece of harmonies, slower and more thought-out than their prior records. John would often recycle lyrics but you could tell a little more time was put into this album. I guess what I'm trying to get at is every record they released used to almost be a complete transformation with the exception of Johns vocals.",0.9564,170
