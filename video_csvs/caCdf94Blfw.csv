2017-One of the best years for films. There were so many great and amazing films this year and only a few of those films in which I personally believe are not the best films receive all of the nominations. It's a shame to see such amazing films recieve one or no nominations and I have to say I'm even more disappointed that the same films and actors recieve several nominations despite it being their first. I have to say I'm disappointed that this is the 90th Academy award show and there were only a select few films that recieved everything. But that's not our decision to make so well done to all the nominees and let's hope for a better one next year.,0.9696,130
