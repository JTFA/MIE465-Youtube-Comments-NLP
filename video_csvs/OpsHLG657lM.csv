Why are you people speaking bad things? Because you are living in sin and the devil who will soon perish in the lake of fire cannot stop The Truth that shall always be known and that is the Gospel of Lord Jesus Christ who is able to forgive sins and save you from perishing Amen.

Words that exit from a person exposes who they truly are, even if they try to hide it, Yea, even your text. Rather sing praise to the Lord of host, Lord Jesus Christ who is above all things, Amen.

Come to Jesus with a repentant heart and accept Lord Jesus Christ as your True Lord and savior, Money, Possession is worthless compared to what God of Israel has prepared for them that love him and keep his commandments Amen!
