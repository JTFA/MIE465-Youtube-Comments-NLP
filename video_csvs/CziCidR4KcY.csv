"Dear Mariah,

My mother has been a huge fan of your work. Honestly when I was younger, I wasn't a huge fan...until now. This song gave me motivations to keep going in my life. Thank you so much for that. The very first time i heard your songs was back when ""We Belong Together"" was still sort of popular. My mom told me before that when I was still inside her stomach was when that song came out. Even though this song was motivational, ""Through The Rain"" also motivated me. Thanks to you, my mom was inspired to sing and to follow in your footsteps. I never actually got to take a closer look at what amazing work you've been doing. Almost every song you've sang, it has that really high note that i don't think anyone can follow up. You are an amazing singer, Mariah. There will be haters out there, but never let that stop you from creating more songs. Never stop believing, because we will never stop believing in you.",0.9712,200
