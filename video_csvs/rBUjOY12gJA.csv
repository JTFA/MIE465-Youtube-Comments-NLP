"Cardio needs to be part of your ¬†everyday life style to live a healthy life. ¬†One easy way ¬†to introduce cardio is to ride a bicycle. ¬† Riding a bike is fun and good exercise plus you save money on transportation. ¬†Walking, bicycles, mass transit and electric vehicles will all be part of making cities livable. ¬† ¬† Ride to school. ¬† Ride to work. ¬† Ride for fun.
Bike to work day should be everyday.. ¬†Employers need to provide places to park and lock bicycles and encourage employees to ride a bicycle to work. Children should be riding a bike to school instead of being dropped off by their parents. Cities need to do more to provide safe walking and biking trails and paths that connect homes, schools and businesses. Speak up and ask for more bicycle paths in your community. Obesity is a growing problem around the world leading to an increase in heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. Walking and biking can help improve health. Buy a child a bicycle. ¬†Your son, daughter, niece, nephew, grandchild or donate one to a local charity as a fund raiser giveaway. You will change a life.",0.9773,217

"Cory Carlson, it is incomplete to state that fat is merely ""converted into glucose"". The majority of fats humans consume come in the form of triglycerides. The glycerol molecule undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis, which converts it into sugar, while the fatty acids are converted into ketone bodies during a process called ketogenesis. As a result of ketogenesis, a ketone body called acetoacetate is produced. Acetoacetate is then converted into two other types of ketone bodies:

 . Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ‚Äì After being keto-adapted for a couple of weeks, you will begin to convert the acetoacetate into BHB as it is a much more efficient source of fuel (it undergoes an additional chemical reaction that provides more energy for the cell than acetoacetate). In general, studies show that the body and brain prefer using BHB and acetoacetate for energy because the cells can use it 70% more efficiently than glucose.
 . Acetone ‚Äì Can sometimes be metabolized into glucose, but is mostly excreted as waste.

You are correct however in stating that ketosis is only a ""survival mechanism"" and that health problems may arise if the body stays in a ketogenic state for too long. 

Additionally, i would appreciate it if you can cite any studies showing that ""The only diet to produce reversal of heart disease is low fat plant based"" as it does seem like a suspiciously biased statement produced by a vegan.",-0.5946,262
"Cory Carlson, there are many more enzymes involved in fructolysis the most important arguably being fructokinase. The fructokinase enzyme is only found in hepatocytes. Fructolysis starts with the phosphorylation of fructose by fructokinase. A few steps later fructolysis produces the same intermediate molecules (GAP and DHAP) that are produced from glucose via glycolysis. But since GAP and DHAP both have phosphate groups attached, they can't leave the liver cell to be used elsewhere. The liver cell can burn some of them for energy, the same as other cells, but it can only use so much.

Since the rest of the body can't process fructose, the liver cells get overwhelmed in a high-fructose diet. The first thing the liver cell does with the excess fructose is store it as glycogen. This is an optimal solution, since glycogen can be broken down into glucose and sent to other cells in the body for their use. But a liver cell can only store a limited amount of glycogen. If a diet is high in fructose the liver runs out of space. When it has all of the glycogen it can store, it uses the extra fructose to create triglycerides, which can be moved outside of the liver for long-term storage as fat. If a person's diet is consistently high in fructose, the excess fat never gets used, and builds up over time. While excess glucose can also be stored as fat, there are unique health concerns with fructose-produced fatty-acids. Fat produced in the liver isn't regulated or stored in the same way as the fat from glucose.

It is indeed correct that fruit contain high contents of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. These compounds however can also be found in many other foods such as vegetables, beans and nuts, without the underlying health concern of fructose consumption.",0.0596,336
Cory Carlson. You might also want to start doing resistance training. You only way 130 lbs and your muscles are only degenerating further. It's as though you are begging for sarcopenia.,0.0772,35
"Cory Carlson. most people once believed the world was flat. To their surprise it was not. A majority opinion does not guarantee it is fact. If you feel good after poisoning yourself for 40 years then that's fine. Feeling healthy and being healthy however are often mistaken. It takes an alcoholic's liver time to break down, same with a heavy fructose consumer. Anyone consuming enough carbohydrates and fats, getting enough sleep and having a healthy nervous system should have ""lotsa energy"" unless they have a condition or are a genetic anomaly. Attributing your high energy levels to food is simply scientifically and statistically incorrect. Correlation does not equate to causation.",0.8156,124
Cory Carson glucose may be our primary source of energy but it hasn‚Äôt always been. Fat is a far more sustainable energy source. Studies are now proving that sugar ( mostly refined) is the main cause of disease in our country. Cutting out sugar is changing people lives.,0.3506,55
