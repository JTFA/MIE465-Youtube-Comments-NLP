"Freeze your flour, thats the only good idea.. flour often goes unused for months to half a year in most households and it wont go bad but it will break down and absorb ambient aroma molecules from your kitchen over that time. Butter does not need to be frozen, it will never go bad.  Air or milk near the lid, bacteria will still grow at the same rate and contamination rate LOL.  Onions arent going to go bad any slower in your wifes discarded panty hose.  Apples are going to rot before any sprouts grow on your taters, and also, since when did sprouts mean your taters were bad?",0.9517,120
