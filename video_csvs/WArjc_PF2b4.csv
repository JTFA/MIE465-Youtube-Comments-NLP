They expected a gradual inflation creep, but they did not realize the damage they have done as inflation is spiking fast. Now they no longer can buy bonds, the bond market is plummeting and yields are rising faster than a rocket, interest will eat corporate profits, rate of growth will turn negative then earnings itself will turn negative. Don't listen to this strong job report nonsense. That argument reminds me of how an interviewer would answer what is your weakness question by providing a strength and mask it as a weakness.
