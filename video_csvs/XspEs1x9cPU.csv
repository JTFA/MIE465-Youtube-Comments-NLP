"Before she disappeared she wasn't really famous. So this video is quite misleading. The reason so many people talk about her is because she was a female in a male dominated job. But she was welcomed into that environment and was actually taught how to fly by a man she dated. She quickly became ""one of the guys"" and was never referred to as a woman, just as she never referred to others as men. She was a pioneer of the working lady. She also didn't like feminism. In fact she is on record a few times denouncing what feminist's were doing. She saw the world (as we all should) as a place that didn't have men and women, but rather just people. We could all take a leaf from her book and start looking at everyone on earth as equals. We need to stop hating on each other. Women hate men because of patriarchy and men hate women because of feminism. Both of which have no place in a modern society. We have true equality now, and we all have the exact same opportunities (we even have a much higher chance of getting work now compared with our male counterparts) and we should lead our own lives and make ourselves as successful and accomplished as possible. If we continue spend your days worrying about stupid point scoring against men then your life is going to rush by and you'll end up lonely and alone. Ladies, we need men more than you realize. They truly are God's greatest gift to us. They hold us, protect us, defend us and look out for us. And become dependable father's with so much love. Yea, sure, they can be a pain in the ass!! But we're not exactly innocent either! Lol. Stop fighting and live your life.",-0.6327,342
