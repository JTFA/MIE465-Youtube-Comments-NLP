David - what if you put the rocket about 20-30 cm above the car? Like a longer pipe with the rocket at the top. Then the car would hang under the rocket and it would be pretty much self stabilszing - at least on the way up. You could even put a gyro controlled set of fins on it :P,0.8494,63

If you hit the brakes the moment it left the ground, it should rock forward, just like motorcross riders do.",0.1779,57
I think the wing on the back messed up the aerodynamics and started the backflip.,-0.34,16
I think wheel torque rotated the car and caused the rocket to counter the forward momentum. Maybe let off the throttle before you fire the rocket if you go again. In the on board you can hear the wheels still full power in the air and the car rotates back more after the rocket stops.,-0.4588,58
"I think wings, a lake and ground effect... Glad you're back and not blowed up! Maybe you could film some more of your machining too.",0.5093,29

"Looks like when traveling upwards the rear spoiler creates a torque which rotates the car backwards (4:33).

"So here are my thoughts.  Just like controlling attitude during a normal RC truck jump, I think there was a bit of a control issue here.
If you look at the slow motion side view footage, you can see that right at takeoff the truck tilted back.  This was likely due to the wheels still being accelerated in the forward direction.  That pitch back caused ground speed to be scrubbed.  
If you try it again, try to brake just a bit during takeoff to pitch the truck forward just a tick.

And whatever you do, please DO try this again!  Haha!",0.8118,113
