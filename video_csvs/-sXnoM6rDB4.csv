"Amazing to observe you mutants through glass upon glass. Very succinct statement; you handle a contemporary video medium with ease and elegance.

(I adjust the onion on the belt, squint, blink, try to remember where I was. Millennials look askance at Another Wrinkly, sidle away to keep their distance.)

Now back when, 'filming a video' (honestly, you won't believe how many lala successful artistes I have attempted to correct when they said that, before giving up) was a THING, we were 'video artists', part of a tech / aesthete elite. Some came out of filmmaking (me) (16mm for six years, labs, tape splicers, no sync sound, experimental weirdo stuff at $6 a minute). And then there were the bored painters and potters and performance types who smelled a good thing and voila! called themselves 'video artists' as well.

Galleries stumbled and scrambled and scratched heads, trying to figure how this fit in. Dealers and collectors made themselves miserable, concluding there was NO-DOUGH in this particular discipline.

We kept doing it, for tiny audiences and each other. And then the bubble busted, spraying bubbles all around the planet, with a) internet and b) digital capture, both accelerating with stunning rapidity into what we have today.

But that still doesn't explain you guys. You are mutants. But you would not have been able to mutate without the above 'technical chemistry' tickling you. 

Forge onward.",0.9439,287
"An off topic question. When are people going to stop calling making videos/movies ""Filmaking"" or recording video ""Filming""? No one uses film anymore and it just sounds silly to call it that in 2018. PS:  I wish you the best of luck in the future Jack!",0.784,57

"Beme was a useless startup that CNN bought off Casey Neistat to gain his followers before the 2016 elections in an attempt to rally support from the new hip crowd for Hillary Clinton. Now that CNN has realized Beme is a useless company they shut it down . Standard Casey Shill, CNN, Samsung, DJI, Boosted Board, Nikon , Cannon, Hillary Clinton etc.",0.4588,70
Beme was fucking retarded from the start,-0.6115,7
"Beme would be a great way for super corporations and politicians to hack social media conversations in real-time. If anything it looks like it's been aimed at kids. So if these two things collide with potential for ""bad content"" to appear on Beme, Beme gets bought by CNN and turns into i guess Children's TV News. The next generation of voters. All gullible.

""Hey guys. Should we wear dust masks like they do in Beijing?"" A lot of money is riding on climate change, but then you guys are marketing Samsung, Red Bull, Nike, Coca-Cola? Tag words right. 

You ran a tech company into the ground twice, burned a lot of cash, explained it in a PR video. 

Have fun working for the mafia did we? I bet it went like, ""Hey can you guys do something with dust masks and pollution."" Bet it was also a pain in the ass to figure out what editorial guidelines CNN gets off the state department:)",0.3378,190
Best of luck dude. Subscribed!,0.8172,7
"CNN bought Beme because they thought they could grab Casey's millions and millions of followers... Massive mistake!  If you look at Casey's videos, some of his most dislike videos are his political videos where he showed support for Obama and Hillary Clinton.  This showed that nearly half of Casey's followers don't share his same political views (which are basically the same as CNN).  The other thing they didn't take into consideration when buying Beme was the average subject matter of his videos.  He hardly every makes news related videos.  Therefor, his audience isn't there to watch news.  It was a very bad idea from a business standpoint for CNN to buy Beme.  The research wasn't done properly on CNN's part and sure enough... it backfired.  Beme News even today has what... maybe 300,000 followers by now?  Not millions and millions like CNN was banking on.",-0.567,162
