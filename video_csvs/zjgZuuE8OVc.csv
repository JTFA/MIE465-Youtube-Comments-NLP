"#heyclaire, I don't know if you'll ever see this, but most YouTube videos these days leave me fake-inspired, inspired only on the superficial level or rather inspired for the wrong things in life like looks, fanciness of things etc but I actually watched your video till the last second of it because it genuinely gives me positivity and hope that I can be more like you, and so pumped to really make those little changes in life. So gorgeous and creative on a different level you - go you.❤️",0.985,98

"Claire Marshall I really enjoyed this video! It’s always interesting to me in knowing how others start their day. So thank you for sharing! 

Ive heard that small tweaks and changes make changing habits better in the long run. So far the small tweaks that I’ve done have made me more successful in my goals this year. I haven’t been spending as much because I have a list of currents needs not a list of wants. I have a morning routine down. 

I would love to wake up early but my body doesn’t agree. Lol! Seriously though I think waking up early gets one ahead start for the day. If you don’t mind my asking...What time do you start to unwind for the day? Getting to bed early for me is difficult. I would like to know what you did.",0.9572,165

"Echoing many others, your channel is so inspiring on various levels. For sure how you film and edit your videos is a lot of fun, for me, to not only enjoy aesthetically, but help spark my own creativity. There's always something so grounded about your videos, too. It never feels like you're pushing an idea or a product, for example. This may sound silly, but it just feels like you're having a casual conversation, letting us know what is happening with you, thoughts you're having, and ""let's just chat about this."" I hope that makes sense. Anyway, thanks for sharing. =)",0.9784,121

"Hey Claire - I have noticed a change in dynamic and tone to your content on YT and across your other SM platforms, and I have to say I absolutely love it. I like how you presented your 'morning routine' in a way that was practicing self-love and personal development. The fact that you explained the thought process behind the daily practice shows that you care about what you are doing and how you are delivering that to add value and help your audience.We all have the same 24 hours, it's how we each choose to spend it that matters. Sending you lots of love and can't wait for your next video :-)",0.9752,120

"Hi Claire! I really enjoy watching your videos and seeing how open you are with vulnerability and self improvement. I wanted to recommend you an app I recently started using called fabulous. It helps you stay on top of your daily habits in a fun and engaging way and offers cool features like guided meditation and some exercises too. It costs about $94 a year which admittedly is pretty steep for an app, but I think it's worth the money because everything in the app is based on science and has already helped me with my habits in the short time I've had it. I think there's a discount if you wait to pay for it (about two days after downloading it's 50% off for the first year) so it's an added bonus of getting it! Ps I'm not sponsored by them but I wish I were bc this app is so useful and it would be awesome to get a discount (esp because I'm a broke a$$ unemployed a$$ college student lmaooo)",0.9861,190

"Hi Claire, i have been reading everywhere that to be a successful youtuber, you have to have a theme or a specific market. But i just cant do that. I upload just kind of like how you do: a mix of everything that I do or I would like to share every week. This one is very helpful. Waking up and changing to work clothes wow! I never do that when im on my day off! Seriously gonna try it. Dont get me wrong, i dont work from home, im actually switching jobs now because my previous job did not actually have any weekends off but i like this idea. Id try it even if my agenda for the day is all about film editing. 

Keep at it claire. Love how you deal with life as  positive and productive as possible while you are also trying to heal yourself. I totally love this outlook!",0.9832,170

"I agree, I’m always way more motivated to do anything if I’m dressed in street clothes as opposed to lounge or pjs. 

I didn’t know anyone else would feel that way too. 

I have set a few resolutions that I’ve been trying to implement, first is cooking more for myself too. But more so, eating regularly. 

This has been hard, I only have a kitchenette, so figuring out how to get better meals with so few options has been a struggle. I’ve gotten pretty good at it though. 

Smoothies in the morning to start my day, I’m lazy, and it’s something I can have on the go if I run out of time. (But I also find I’m starting to be less lazy)

I’d like to incorporate some of your ideas into my routines, here’s to better days. 

Cheers!!",0.9546,179

"I've personally been trying to put on ""work clothes"" everyday, even if I'm not going anywhere. It also makes me more...motivated (???) to leave my house. Like if I know I have to go to the post office or go buy water at the grocery store, I'm more likely to complete those errands if I'm ALREADY dressed in the morning as opposed to feeling like I have to get dressed JUST to go out.

Also Claire, if you don't want to share that's totally okay, but I was curious as to how your mum/Mary was doing. Is she well? My grandma/best friend in the entire world was diagnosed over a year ago, but lately her condition's been deteriorating faster than ever before.

"Love this video! Thanks for sharing Claire - some people set resolutions at the beginning of the year and when they don't see results immediately, get frustrated and give up. What's easily forgotten is that you're doing something out of the norm in your daily routine, and these ""habits"" don't come overnight, but will take time in adjusting. It's not a race, like you said, just a journey to a better you and to being a better person.",0.8698,89

Loved this video! So motivating. One of my goals this year was waking up early and a key to doing this for me was not having my phone in my room/using it as my alarm. I use an old school alarm now and read before bed. It has made a huge difference to my sleeping pattern and overall I’m not spending half as much of my time browsing social media.

"really, really enjoyed this video. have been super demotivated recently to do anything, even to focus on a youtube video. this was much needed - loved it. like a chill girl's guide for other chill girls to actually get the things they want done done,, for the right reasons. was also thinking recently about how much of our lives have been shared - I think I've been watching your videos for years and years now, without realising so much time has passed. clicked on a video of yours that I thought was new from three years back and was shocked at how recent I had felt it had happened. time passes. we're all in this together. don't know why I'm writing this but thanks ::)",0.9029,139
