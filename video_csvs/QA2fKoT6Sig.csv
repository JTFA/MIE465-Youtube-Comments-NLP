"So, closing the screen door is the solution to keeping a pelican out.¬† I'd like to know what her solution would be if one of those 900 lb tortoises wanted to truck on thru. Somehow, I don't think the screen, or even the fabric is really going to stop one of those little tanks.¬† I honestly don't think I could sleep in a tent on an island, where there was a very real possibility that I could be trampled or nibbled on by a Galapagos tortoise.¬† I really like all the fingers and toes that I was born with, thank you very munch.",0.8849,113
