"I actually disliked Softube Modular. It's SO processor intensive, uses iLok, and is quite limited. Reaktor Blocks on the other hand is $199, and you have access to the user library, which has thousands of absolutely incredible ""blocks"" (modules). Plus, you're getting Reaktor, which is infinitely powerful. IMO if I had to stick with one plugin for the rest of my life, it'd probably be Reaktor simply because I've been using it for 15+ years and still haven't run out of uses/ideas. :)",0.4485,103

I agree. Reaktor with it's Blocks is far more flexible and fun than Softube Modular. Though Softube sounds pretty awesome for a plugin. But so does Reaktor,0.9281,30

"I love the composition you came up with at the end. I hear what you are saying concerning the enlightenment of manipulating physical modules, but my conclusion was it just won't work for most people due to time and money. Most don't have the money to buy analog modules, nor do they have the time to build them from scratch. Nor would it make sense for most people to build physical modules if everything else they are doing is software based. That being said, I would love to build a wall of synth modules at some point in my life, but it wouldn't make sense to put music exploration on hold when I have a whole world of software modules at my fingertips.",0.875,132

You can download more free or paid plugins from the VCV website under here (https://vcvrack.com/plugins.html). You need to download the plugin and drag it into the plugin manager folder to sync third party plugins.,0.659,38
