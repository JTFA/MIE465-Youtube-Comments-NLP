100% correct, mate! I seriously can't believe this comment section. How idiotic are people?

The same bloody thing happened in Syria, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Korea, etc etc.

And people still believe the same bullshit story.

""He's killing his own people""
""People are oppressed""

blah blah blah

Every single time, it is MOSSAD/CIA funded traitors who begin a violent rampage that very quickly turns from ""protestors"" into armies (i.e. ISIS).

And people are still stupid.

"+Dark Ages Return

100% right again. This is absolutely a Jewish-led terrorist attack against Iran. The JewNATO States of Saudi Israelia has been planning this for a long time. 

Iraq was illegally destroyed, now it is in chaos.
Syria - illegally destroyed, now the Kurds are stealing territory, and the Kurds are strong allies with Israel and the USA

Now we see the declaration from the Zionist Occupied Government scum in the USA that Jerusalem (Al Quds) will become the capital of the Zionist state, pushing the occupation further.

And then this - we're now witnessing the beginning of Iran's destruction.

And stupid people are still brainwashed into believing there is something wrong with Iran's government.

Iran's government does have a problem - ILLEGAL Western sanctions that were designed to starve the people of Iran. That is the problem for the Iranian government. Western terrorism.

These are very sad times for intelligent human beings. I really hope Iran's government can keep these Mossad agents under control. Iran and North Korea are 2 of the last free nations on the planet. If they collapse, it will be a tragedy.",-0.9939,211

But Iranian shown that they are very good at improvising, they want to change the regime. They are shouting ""death to the supreme leader A. Khamenei"" and Rouhani, that the Islam and the holy book of the Muslims should be sacrificed for saving the country, and it becomes an anti-Islamic regime protest which demands that all the regime should change and the Islam should vanish forever.

Isliye allah aur muhammad tumse naraz hai ki inse zayada cow mut tumhare dimagh me ghumta hai. 

Paki madarsachhap bhikhari jehadi. Muhammad was a pedophile warlord looter murderer rapist. Who converted Indian weak people. Allah gave Muslims following good things. Hungry and poor are small word for Muslims. So today including Rohingya 7 crore Muslims refugees all over the world. Including Osama in pakistan 4 crore killed in last 20 years in pakistan Afghanistan Arab Europe and also in sea drowned while running away from Islam to save lives. And almost 12000 Muslims refugees are leaving Islam everyday in Europe  America and India. 

After killing of 30 lakh Muslims and raping of 3 lakh Muslims women, Bangladesh chhin liya gaya. Kicked and humiliated all over the world.
