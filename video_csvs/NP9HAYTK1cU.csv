"It was not Ghost Peppers. I seriously doubt that those are even Habaneros. As it was already said in the comments, eating ripe Ghost Peppers would probably warrant a visit to the hospital from the kids so small, but even Habaneros are so fucking hot, I don't see how they would be able to do anything apart from running around like headless chickens trying to douse the flames in their heads. Habaneros range from 100k to 350k on Scoville scale, and that's no fucking joke. Just to remind you - Tabasco is a meager 2000 units on Scoville scale and not all children (or even some sensitive adults) can stomach it. How about something that is at least 50 times spicier? I call a bluff. Either those were not Ghost or Habanero Peppers and it was something relatively mild, like Fresno Chilli or they just edited the video.",0.8706,163
