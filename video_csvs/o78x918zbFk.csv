Now when she goes outside she asks me to do her make up like “Tati does it” and she gets in such better mood and it make me so happy to see her so excited about something because that is so rare. This palette is something that I could never afford and I would love to be able to say hey mum, look now your make up is really like Tati does her own. But in any case, we love you Tati and I am grateful just to see the smile on my mum when we watch you review, swatch and do tutorials on your channel. <3",0.9961,187

I'd like to win because Natasha Denona is a brand I've always wanted to experience but probably never could because they're so expensive!

You give attention to brands that other reviewers would look over, simply to find easier adn cheaper alternatives to people who may not be ale to afford brands like Natasha Denona.

"rie lynn literally calm down sis, I returned it and got a new one. Cause obviously only some of them were faulty?? Like what if I did it by accident like 2 months later and I couldn’t return it, might as well find out sooner than later 🙄",0.5204,55

"the huda beauty palette the golden rose one did the same for me. i should have reported it immediately, but i put it back because i actually caught it, so i left it there. also this was for my mom. she didn’t seem concerned with it, and i also didn’t want to take it with me into the travel, but then i completely forgot about it, and i was doing a makeup on a client, and i was holding it, and i slightly “flipped” it to the side, and bum!  😞😞😞 i will be smarter next time.",0.7988,118
