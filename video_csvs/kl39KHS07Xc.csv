"I feel like UBI will be the most viable economic structure when (almost) everything becomes autonomous. When desk jobs are replaced with software algorithms, when food and goods are delivered via drone, and when robotic constructs clean our streets, THAT is when UBI will come into play.

When people have less jobs to work, they have to rely on something better: Universal Basic Income. This means that people will no longer work on things they don't like, either scientific discoveries, art, content creation, travel, religious worship, or pretty much anything else that they actually will like and will want to do. That's why kids these days want to become YouTubers, bloggers, and etc.. because they *want* to do it and can see themselves *enjoying* their job.

We humans strive to be happy. We want to live how we want, NOT how we need to. This is why UBI is not only the best option, but will eventually become our ONLY option in sustaining ourselves.",0.8797,194

"I mean... it would definitely lead to inflation. At the end of the day if more people have access to capital - even at the expense of the wealthy - it's not like demand for consumer goods stays the same. Even poor people are subject to commercials and the desire for material goods (listen to 90s Hip-Hop). More demand will always lead to rising prices. Even when you factor in new goods and services being created, the increase in economic activity means an increase grab for more raw materials to create said need. So unless we create an environmentally responsible economic reality that still has room for technological advancement and we can solve space travel so we can mine other planets, prices still go up. The perception of scarcity must be maintained for our current power structures to exist. Maybe I'm wrong; maybe my understanding of economics is rudimentary at best, but something about this doesn't seem to work with our current model.",0.8278,178

I really appreciate your hard work. You present a very transparent story of the entire issue at hand. There should be more like you guys,0.8086,27
"I really cannot see how UBI can work on a logical level.
There is an obvious avoidance of where the money will come from to give everyone a minimal (and logically meaningless nominal income), but i can only assume most countries will opt to tax the wealthy.  This will always lead to the wealthy moving out, (which means you lose your key infrastructure) or seeking loopholes to reduce in impact of taxes on profits.

If taxes are raised on the rich/successful companies i guarantee the cost of goods will increase, this will lead to the UBI not being able to meet requirements (as i stated before its a nominal figure) and it would need to increase to cover the shortfall. This would lead to even higher taxes and price increases and so forth.

I cannot imagine also the impact of spending in our economy once everyone is gifted additional income.
All spending is essentially investment, and since the general population are not business people and generally make bad financial decisions (this is why people in poverty who win the lottery, end back up in poverty not long after) you will end up with nations of consumers. There is no evidence productivity will increase.
You will no doubt see the market for comic books, anime, gaming and trendy gadgets boom enormously creating masses of jobs in mostly vapid and superficial industries.

Engineers, doctors, scientists, mathematicians will decline in numbers because why work extra hard when you can work just a little and still be comfortable?

In economics there is a saying 'In order to consume, you must produce.'

If you do not have to produce to consume, then you WILL subsidise inactivity.
Economics has 2 tools to control spending, taxes and subsidies. If you want more of something you subsidise it (e.g corn, cotton), if you want less of something you tax it (e.g cigarettes,  alcohol).

How these studies somehow suggest that simple laws of economics do not apply with UBI is baffling, it is literally saying that if you give people free money they will work harder.
There are numerous examples such as 'the backward bending labour supply curve' which show as workers earn more money than they typically need they reduce their working hours.


And sadly there are people who are bottom of the IQ scale, and these people are more often than not those who make up the impoverished. Giving them more money to go to school will honestly yield no result, they will take ten times longer to learn a simple task than the average person, and even then forget how to do it the next week.",0.867,500
"I think a UBI would be a good idea. If people had a universal income that was enough to survive on, many would focus more on getting a job they feel engaged and motivated in rather than scrambling to find anything that will keep them alive even if it isn't a good fit for them and they aren't a good fit for it. It would also mean that conditions would have to improve for the worst jobs, because employers would be motivated to improve employee well-being rather than just providing enough money to survive. The problems will also likely go away soon anyways because unskilled labor where you can treat your workers like shit is usually the easiest to automate.
At the same time, companies would be rewarded for making their workplaces better because they would be able to get away with paying employees less than a living wage if they made their companies sufficiently rewarding to work for. This means that even if taxes were raised in such a way that companies shouldered most of the burden, they would still come out about the same if they played their cards right. They might even come out ahead, because motivated employees would be easier to find when all the people who only cared about surviving with the money would get out of the way.
There would be upheaval in the short term, of course. Money is a useful regulating system in the economy and even if UBI was only at the ""barely surviving"" level it would still be a major shift. However, given a couple of years culture would shift to encourage whatever kinds of labor we'd been lacking. Because true luxury would still require a salary or other supplementary income, jobs would still be in demand, though the balance of power would shift towards workers and thus encourage higher standards of treatment.
The most important effect, though would be the removal of perverse incentives. Our society has a lot of problems that stem from the fact that people are often motivated to harm others to maintain their own livelihoods, and if everyone's livelihood was guaranteed it would mean a shift towards a more fulfillment-based economy. Doctors would have less incentive to encourage unnecessary treatments if their careers were only a supplemental source of income, for example. There will always be people who play to perverse incentives like that, but there will be a lot fewer people who need to in a society with UBI.",0.9815,445

"I would like to add one more option to paying for UBI. As corporations start using AI to gain massive profits, they will pay the government about 8 hours of work from the robot to put into a UBI fund. Ex. Let's say a manufacturing plant once had 100 workers working 8 hours a day and it has become an autonomous manufacturing plant only requiring 10 workers for maintenance. The manufacturing plant is now producing three times the goods with the tenth of its workforce. As the robots get better within the next month and start working better than the best employees of that manufacturing plant, they will produce more goods within those 8 hours than a normal human being. Therefore, as technology goes forward, more money is going into the UBI fund as it requires corporations to pay 8 hours of work profit into the fund. Now, no one is taxed higher and no special programs like welfare need to be destroyed to make room for UBI. Hold the corporations taking away the jobs accountable not the taxpayers.",0.9552,193

"Sadly there will never be widespread UBI. Its one of those things that you can prove works for everyone but people will just see it as ""cheating"" somehow or be to easily manipulated by those that it wont directly help as much, like bigger companies that may have to pay higher taxes, or defense contractors and politicians that woudl have to move funds form the things that secure them the most personal gain. To many great ideas, that are proven to work, are never implemented because people will never be ok with helping each other unless it directly helps them too, right now.
Lest say the US wanted to do this. so lets say thats $5000 a year to each person (just pretend we dont have to deal with family income difference and everything for right now). How do we pay for that? Where are the biggest expenses? Military. So lets cut the military budget by 18% for this. We woudl still have the biggest military and be plenty protected, but this cut will cost someone money. And those someones are the people that can spend millions to make sure this doesn't happen. While it may help millions of people and only ""hurt"" mabie 100 that will still be far more well off than anyone still, it will never be. Because those 100 care more about making all the money personally, rather than helping everyone as a whole. Those 100 could threaten to take funding from politicians that vote for it, and advertise to citizens in the middle and upper class about how they are being cheated because lower class citizens woudl be getting ""free money"", even saying that they are directly taking YOUR money.
We see this with the NRA that advertises guns as a lifestyle that you NEED so that people will side with them and gun manufacturers that pay them and make all of the money. People are easy to manipulate, and reluctant to learn on their own. If they are told that something is bad all the time, they dont care if its true, or rather they dont care if its not. Its easier to pick that side, believe what your told, and not to go looking for more information that may show your wrong. No one likes to feel foolish so its easier to tell yourself your ides and thoughts are right, even if those ideas hurt you or are proven wrong in the majority. Like is stated in the video, The idea that people would use this UBI to just buy alcoholic and drugs is not grounded in any fact, Its actually the opposite. But they are told thats what poor people do and all a UBI is is poor people trying to find a way to not work and have you pay for them. I know im showing my political side here, but these views are often purely ""conservative"" talking points.

You cannot apply engineering careers to the general population. It requires some of the brightest students, one aspect of smart people is they probably aren't happy doing nothing anyway. They see where they want to go and the more conscientious will work hard to achieve their goals.

They are obviously not the people UBI is targetting, UBI is about helping the lowest earners in society.
Sadly many of these people are not bright, and they have poor motivation, bad habits and generally make bad decisions financially and organisationally.
Its not hard to earn $12,000 if you live in the US.
Im pretty sure if you work in mcdonalds for 40 hours a week you will get over $15,000.

We all know people who work the min wage job, and expect to live on it their entire life. They arent interested in learning a trade or developing any skills they have.
They complain about wages and dont see that there is a ladder in front of them, and other careers exist. 90% of people earn above min wage, its absurdly easy to achieve.

What needs to happen is a change in their mindset, they need to take responsibility for their lives and not blame the system. We cant all be millionaires but if you are not considered mentally or physically disabled you can at least hold down a job. If you want more in life then find something you like, that people need and get good at it.

If you want to be rich? Find something thats hard that very few people are good at or willing to do and get good at it.

"The strategies of cutting our way to UBI or raising corporate taxes to hand out free money will not work. These ideas would not be anywhere enough to fund Universal Basic Income. As I stated providing UBI at the poverty level (no where near a living wage) would eat up our entire budget. That already includes the massive and often unnecessary military spending.
Plus you must remember drastically cutting the military would result in millions of lost jobs from soldiers to shipbuilders, shopkeepers. For many in this country enlistment is their path to the middle class.
So lets talk the tax rate. Yes the corporate tax rate is down since Reagan but that has much to do with many business paying personal taxes rather than corporate taxes. Yes corporations do legally shield profits over seas but even if we go with the high estimates of 2.1 trillion dollars much of that would be a one time gain in repatriation…which would be negotiated at a lower rate.
Can we cut the budget to UBI?Lets just say you eliminated the military (you can’t but we are being hypothetical) that would result in 600 billions in savings. Just 3.2 billion to go. You suggest foreign aid. Okay we can cut that. Now we have only 3.1 billion and change to go.
So if you want UBI, again paid at the poverty level, we would need massive tax increases that would devastate the economy. The revenues in the US would almost need to double. That means having a progressive tax bracket that takes 70–80% of the wealth from top earners. This would destroy the economy and lead to massive unemployment.
Maybe we go with a Value Added Tax. These are very regressive and hurt the poor….and still would not double our revenues to pay for UBI.
It is also politically unfeasible. This is a nation where we can’t raise gas taxes a few cents on the logical argument that revenues that pay for the roads are down because cars are more fuel efficient.
UBI is simply unsustainable and belongs in the science fiction from whence it came.",-0.7865,397

This politics made the EU leftist governments and the main EU structure fail hard in the last 10 years. I suppose a program of this kind could attract immigrants needed to maintain political influence (in every country immigrants vote around 80% left), it has nothing to do with eliminating poverty. The way to do it, is to create new workplaces and keep inflation and unemployment a little lower than natural. This program would lead to growing inflation and and an increased cost of fewer labour force = a declining economy on a course which at some point in the future  will inevitably be unable to sustain itself.

UBI and socialism is the way to go. With the advent of AI, automation, smart technology, robots can replace most routine jobs, and such repititive work suits them too, not so much for humans. We are at the stage where we can depend on automation to take on low-level jobs. You might wonder, what will humans do then if robots take their routine jobs? Well, humans will likely do creative work, work that makes them think, work that is their passion. Will people even work? I would argue yes, because I believe people want to do something in their lives, they want to do something great, they want to produce and not just consume.

"well, I did some calculations and the total annual cost of a UBI of $1000 for adults and $300 for children (in the US) would cost around $3,253,920,000,000, or three trillion, two hundred fifty-three billion, nine hundred twenty million dollars. I'm not against it, but I think that we would need to do a bit more than cut welfare, or maybe change the model. a Negative Income UBI might work (getting less money from the UBI as your annual income increases), but completely cutting all welfare would screw over the elderly because they need to see a doctor more frequently. and good luck cutting the defence budget. Just want to clarify, i am talking about the US alone. these statistics are of the US only.",-0.5791,150
