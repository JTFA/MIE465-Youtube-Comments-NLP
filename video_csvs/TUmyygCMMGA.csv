Later in the video, it talks about the employment rate averaging 80% except for recessions, and this seems to be meant as evidence that employment stays the same over time. Which is fairly absurd of course, because recessions are exactly those times that are the concern. But yes, other than the periods we're concerned with, there are no periods we're concerned with.

The top left corner of 4:44 is the exact problem, the time delay. With the serious problems in the education system, there are serious concerns that workers will not exist fast enough for the future jobs created by the productivity gains of accelerating automation.

They would do jobs that needed to be done, but they had the capacity to do so much more. When technology came that automated it, humans could move to other work. This is because the human brain was the most complex and versatile device on the planet, and still is. Our brains, though, are still just an arrangement of matter, and anything they can to can also be done by a computer.

What happens when the robots are creating new jobs, but the new jobs don't create enough open positions for the population? That's the real problem. I don't have a for sure answer of ""yes, robots will take over"" or ""no, they won't,"" but that's something I think is glossed over regularly. Yes, new jobs are created, but are they creating enough positions? With the way technology is advancing so far probably not. Jobs may very well always exist, but if 50%, hell if only 25%, of the population can't get a job, through on fault of their own, you've got a serious problem. Just look at the transportation industry. That's a healthy chunk of the population. If those jobs just disappeared will technology really create enough to replace those jobs? I doubt it.",-0.5945,220

"I think the bigger problem is that we live in a society where more automation (less human labor required) is even potentially bad for people doing the work. Just think about that for a second and let it sink in how little sense that actually makes. Try to forget about the fact that we live in a system that requires work to get money to live. That idea is so ingrained in us that its hard to see past it, but try to question it or at least put it out of your mind for a few minutes.

Isnt doing less work the fundamental driving force of human ingenuity? If a job is fully automated, then the work that people were doing isnt necessary anymore. As a collective whole we literally have to do less work to maintain our situation. And its not as if people *want* to work, especially not in the menial types of jobs that automation replaces. We want to work because we want money. And why do we have to work to make money? Because if we didnt work, those jobs that produce the things that we spend our money on wouldn't get done... except that they would... because they are automated, they dont require people working to function.

As automation increases, the entire system collapses at a philosophical level. When all the jobs that produce our needs are automated then why do we work 8+ hours a day so that we can meet our needs? I realize that this is not the case yet, but think of how much less work is required now to meet basic needs than about 50 years ago. Why do we still work the same amount?

Because in the current system we dont work for the product of our labor (in a collective/societal sense). We work so that we can buy the product of work (both human and automated) from the people who own it because they own the mechanisms through which that work is done (either by hiring human labor or buying automated labor). This is the problem",-0.8796,388
"I think the biggest flaw if the counter argument is that it does not factor in what ""new jobs"" mean. When you talk about companies expanding and consumers spending more, the jobs which would be ""created"" are the very jobs that are entirely being replaced. And using a comparison to the past disregards what type of progress we are making. The biggest innovation nowadays it's not in hardware, it's in software. We're getting to a point (or are already at a point) where computers and automation can entirely compete with real human minds. If a business increases productivity and can expand, they can simply use automation to do the things new business executives would do. The jobs that are being replaced are not niche careers, they are the most employed careers such as the retail and service industry.",0.4215,155

A Locus robot is more advanced than Kiva 's. Costing $40,000 each that can replace a Walmart human that can replace items  that need to be put on the shelves. If a human worker stocking shelves  earns $13.33 per hour, the Robotic worker pays for its purchase price on the 126th day, working 24 hours a day times 125 days times $13.33 per hour. 126th day for the next decade Walmart doesn't have to pay a human worker.168 hours in a week.

The explosion of service jobs is a desperate effort to grovel at the feet of the few who now own everything, to pry from their iron grip a mere pittance to get by. It produces NOTHING. And while IT is highly productive in certain respects (though a waste of human effort in others), by its nature it concentrates wealth in the few who set the machines to work on their behalf.

Investment in new labour saving tech hasn't yet happened. That's why we haven't seen a rise in productivity. It won't happen as long as companies can still exploit cheap labour. Look back at the industrial revolution in Britain. It's no surprise it happened there instead of other European countries such as France. Wages were far higher in Britain. If wages are low there is little incentive to invest in new technology. High wages certainly drives innovation as companies look at ways of cutting costs. Once wages begin to rise once more we will see companies falling over themselves to invest in tech that will rid them of most human labour once & for all. The AI we have today is equivalent to the internet back in 1990. In 30 years from now we won't recognise the world of 2018 just as we can't recognise 1990 today. The changes have been so vast.

"Problems with this video:
1. Something not happening in the past doesn't mean that it won't happen in the future
2. Job automation DID cause massive job losses and suffering. Laborers protested, rioted, and died over this. 
3. Job automation is already wrecking havock on the labor market, it's just not something some ivory tower economist will see looking at bullshit statistics (eg. unemployment rate) from his/her cubicle. Just look at all the unemployed/underemployed college graduates working retail jobs (my neighbor graduated from a top 3 public university with a STEM degree and is currently waiting tables at a restaurant), or the decimated areas in the rust belt. Everybody knows that free trade shipped factories overseas, but what doesn't get enough attention is that automation is responsible for a huge percentage of those jobs being lost. Again, you're not going to see this from some doctored unemployment figure.
4. The question isn't just about # of jobs, its about QUALITY of jobs. Unemployment rate can remain flat, but if 3 million truck drivers with middle class salaries start working minimum wage retail and personal care aid type jobs (the jobs with the most projected growth), then that's an impending disaster. 
5. People need money to buy things. If they lose their jobs, then they can't buy things.

"The companies will be able to expand, but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll hire more workers. There are four industries of work, Primary - Resource Gathering, Secondary - Manufacturing, Tertiary - Service, and Quaternary - Intellectual. The primary industry and most of the secondary industry are already gone due to automation, but the real problem now is that the quaternary industry, which pays the most, is increasingly done by bots. Let's say Vox expands due to their success with bots writing stories. Does that translate to Vox hiring more people to write? No, it translates to Vox investing even more into the thing that increased profits, which is bots. As their profits increase, and their bot becomes more advanced, more of their actual jobs will be gone. You could argue that jobs are being created for automation engineers, but thousands of writers just got replaced by something made by 5 or less people.",0.9684,174

"The fundamental problem with the productivity argument is that the gig economy is actually covering up the impacts of productivity gains from mechanization. Essentially, these shorter time jobs have significantly lower productivity. This is why, for example, significant automation in the oil industry didn't show up in terms of productivity. 

The other problem is how automation arrives. Companies mechanize more in recessions so as to avoid paying workers, and therefore, the full impact of automation often isn't felt until afterwards.",-0.8107,90
"The hole in your reasoning is that you can buy more things only if you have enough money. If robots continue to take jobs and the population keeps increasing, unemployment rates will grow. Right now people are moving to more qualified jobs instead of low-end ones which is fine.  But there is a fixed amount of qualified jobs at any given time, what will happen when there will be more people qualified for the job than jobs available? Well, they will fall back on low-end jobs which will already be scarce because of robots, driving up the unemployment rates. If you add automation to population growth to years of work required before retirement, you have a big issue that's been completely ignored by governments. Stronger economies like the USA are still okayish, but in more fragile ones the effects are already visible and destructive. In Italy, we have over 30% of unemployment for under 35. And a lot of ""employed"" in that age category have contracts of 3 or 6 months. There is no generational change because you can retire after 40 years of work, if you push that number down to help the change then it will be impossible for our economy to sustain the elders. There are people who keep studying because they can't find a lower-end job, which leads to my first point. If the population keeps increasing we will reach the tipping point in the next decades. From my point of view you can do three things:
-Slow down technology adoption
-Change how work impacts society at his foundation
-Birth Control
We are doing nothing.",-0.8124,298

And just a personal opinion here guys, you are asking ECONOMISTS about that issue? Really?  Economists measure almost everything primarily by numbers and money, not people and societies. You should ask sociologists, society and evolution observers, engineers and people with advanced knowledge about business and technology.

Goverments are full of economists. Banks are full of economists. Are you happy about the way they lead?",0.6046,127

"When we talk about robots, I assumed we're talking about Machine Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence... 
""Automation"" Totally misses the point. It's not Automation we're worried about now. Automation is already here, as you said automation anxiety has been around in the 20s 30s 50s whatever. Now its time to be worried about ""Autonomization"" (the act of making something autonomous). Sure innovation will create more jobs in other ways but a self-learning machine that can learn the tasks of the newly created jobs better and faster is the problem.  Automation doesn't evolve until we decide to use it for other applications. Once you make something that can be used in almost anything and even suggest wrongdoings and maybe even try to ovveride human decisions (Because Humans are not perfect.) for the better good of the whole... you got a real problem here. And you won't be able to catch up once its off the leash so unless we think fast and come up with solutions that's it. ""For Now, at least, we have better things to worry about."" -Vox
