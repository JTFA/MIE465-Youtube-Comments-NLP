"This made my day! I grew up in a Muslim country and now I am living in Montreal. I have never felt closure to any religion, I don't care about them in anyway but since I was a little kid, Christmas has been my favorite part of the year. My family always celebrated the New Year's Eve with lots of love (still not in the sake of the religious meaning, just because it is cute and it brings people together) and there are no words to describe how much it all means to me. The first year I moved to Montreal, as an 18 years old teen, I was incredibly excited for my first ""proper"" Christmas, seeing the whole city celebrating it. I went to the annual Christmas market and it was beautiful! And there it was, Santa Claus, making kids happy. As a teen, I thought he wouldn't be interested in me or my friends, so I was hesitant but my friend pushed us to take a pic with him. When I sat down next to him, he cracked a big laugh, hold my shoulder very tightly and pulled me closer as we all smiled at the camera. It caught me off guard! This man was cheerful as ever, even though we weren't kids, he hugged and welcomed us as we were.  He was adorable, always smiling and laughing with that big belly and blushed cheeks. You can't imagine how happy I was!! I still remember that day and it was one of the moments that made me happiest. The picture turned out very funny too, you can see the light in my eyes for real :)",0.9984,313
