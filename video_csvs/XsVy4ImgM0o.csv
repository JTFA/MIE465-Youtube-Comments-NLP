"I actually love this guy, but after watching like 4 of his videos in a row I'm getting sick of hearing the same voice harmonization. I don't know how but I went from praising him to getting the fucking chills and beeing creeped out by his voice.The harmonization of his voice now profoundly disturbs my soul, it's weird. I wish he used his voice differently.

"Not meaning to discredit Jacob's incredible ear for harmony, but surely all these separate video angles of each vocal part are fake, because he has that Novation Harmonizer keyboard and software?

The chord progressions feel like they are concatenations of complexity for the sake of it, and I do not feel that it adds anything to what, at its heart, is really a very simple and gentle song. Great lead vocal, though.",0.5766,109
