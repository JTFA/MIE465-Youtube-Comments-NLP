It's okay to reach out for help and support. If you can't handle something on your own, I encourage you to seek guidance and help! Don't bottle up. It's not weak to ask for help. Your family and friends are here for you, also remember, regardless of wether you end up alone the people around you like family are obviously not around forever, so don't freaking take them for granted!",0.9782,121

Maybe something you said, or did, or something someone else told you? And since there's no-one there to tell you that it is nonsense, do you have any tips on how to stop this before it gets blown out of proportion? Thanks",-0.6621,119

Even when you are married it is really important for both of you to have time doing your own stuff. It can be something as simple as going to a movie by yourself. ¬†It helps you recharge, and even give more to your relationship making it stronger. This is a great video Rachel!

You can not possible hate everything about yourself so find the things you like and if you really need help ask your partner what they think is great about you and focus on that. Tell yourself everyday that part of you is amazing (earlier this year I had social issues and I spent all 2017 telling myself I was worthy of these social events and sure enough know I just know I am) and once you start to hear it every day you'll start to believe it.

"Rachelleea love this video- however one thing I would note is to be careful not to portray too negatively those who love being around people quite often, or the majority of the time, as those people may also have a high level of self awareness, peace with themselves and appreciation of boundaries etc. Always love your opinion based videos xx",0.9682,65

I see people occasionally and usually book plans a month in advance with someone because I covet my alone time so much. There just aren't enough hours in the day to get done what needs to get done as it is, and I don't have time to listen to someone go on about problems they refuse to do anything about. Ain't nobody got time for that. I enjoy the quiet time with my fur kids, work, and my small but well loved tribe. That's all I need. I'm not inspired to make a vid like this one.

"This is super helpful to have watched! I have attachment issues, I feel the need to be around one person and all the time. So, I currently  always seem to have a need to be around my boyfriend, but only him, because without him I will feel anxious but I also can't stand being around more people than just him or else I'll be anxious then as well. He hates that I have this attachment, and I'm trying so so hard to be comfortable with being alone and without his presence but I don't know how to. I love being alone in a lot of ways, I don't need certain people ‚Äî except for him. I seriously don't know how to get rid of this feeling, I don't know how to comfortably do a lot of things without feeling like I have to have him with me. Any help and advice would be so much appreciated. I want to be able to go to work and do my job without anxiously awaiting the time I get to be with him. And I want to be able to feel safe without him, which I don't because I feel that discomfort from being outside of his presence. Anyway, have a wonderful day!! Xx",0.9794,231

Me who is turning 55 years old in May 2018 and who has been taking care of my elderly parents for years putting my life on hold since 1987. Pothectic as it sounds is for the first time in my life taking time out for me, booking a hotel (Belhurst Castle) in Geneva, New York for 4 days by myself. For some reason I felt a need to be alone on my 55th Birthday. I don‚Äôt know what to expect ie Dining alone in a restaurant or just going to the drive thru at McDonalds if I become a coward we will see. But I‚Äôm feeling proud for myself that I‚Äôve taking the first step to book a room for myself for 4 days one hour away from home. Baby steps I guess. I‚Äôm curious of the outcome. I‚Äôll let you know. But I have to say Thank you. For your video, It‚Äôs been insightful.",0.836,199
