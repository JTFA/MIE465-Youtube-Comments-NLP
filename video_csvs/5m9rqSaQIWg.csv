"Let me get this straight: I'm a sexist pig because I made a video compilation of cupcakes with suggestions for what girls might like? Did I at any point in this video say these are the only cupcakes girls would like? I don't even know how to respond to how unintelligent you sound. I'm not a misogonist or a sexist. I treat all genders and people equally. And sexism shouldn't be something people get away with now, not in 10 years from now.
