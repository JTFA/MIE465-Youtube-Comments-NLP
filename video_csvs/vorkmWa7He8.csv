"Damn this is some actual ""next level scary"" shit. On the surface, without thinking about the backend, it looks cool and awesome. But these big tech concerns are prying into the lifes of people everywhere they can. Into their homes with online smart home tech and/or Alexa/Google Home, into their browsing habits and private comms with Google and big social media, into their telemetry via smartphones (google, again), and now into their shopping habits. And there is no control, no escape. Where i live people still discuss the possibility of goverments getting rid of bare cash, wich would seriously impact privacy against your goverment, but big data is progressing alot faster than anyone could even regulate it, if they even tried. If concepts like these get widespread, cash isnt even an option anymore even if it still exists. And every transaction you do, will be processed by one of these companies. I usually dont like painting it all black, but it really feels like we are heading straight into on of those dystopian future novels where a select few tech companies overpower the goverments and establish a totalitarian technocracy with total control over every single individual.",0.6757,226

"I recently subscribed to your videos, and I love them, however as for the no cashier issue, the way I see it, for example, Walmart near me. they have automated cashiers and paid ones, however after a certain time lets say 10 p.m. they are down to a skeleton crew and only open the automated ones, they have no real person cashiers just a supervisor at the kiosk by them. so in my eyes, Amazon, doing this is just putting them a step ahead of the rest of the industry when it comes to shopping. yes, it is sad that a lot of people may end up not having a job due to this, however at the rate, it is going, all stores will move to some form of an automated/robotic cashier service.",0.4939,155
