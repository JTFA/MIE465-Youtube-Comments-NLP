"I have been trying to give this show the benefit of the doubt for the past couple seasons, hoping they'd find a way to blow our minds eventually, but this death has shown me there's no hope for the future of this show. 
Everything done on this show is strictly for profit, they have no respect for the fans and the audience. This death was ONLY cutting budget. Cutting as many main actors as they can attempt to get away with and trying to make us care about the dozens of characters on the show that we don't care for(since they're cheaper). Killing main characters for cheap ratings grabs and trying to make emotional moments.
If the show was made with any passion at all, you wouldn't need to kill main characters for an emotional and thrilling story. 
It doesn't matter if you liked Chandler Riggs as Carl or not, whatever story they try to produce after this (which this is about the point where the story starts focusing heavily on carl) is going to be dull and uninteresting. Whatever character that they try to fill in Carl's shoes isn't going to be nearly as impacting, because there's only 3 characters left from the beginning that we've grown with and understand.

They lost me on that But I think something is going to happen with this Carl bite and the Rick flashbacks I believe we are about to see a connection that somehow Rick survived death and holds the key to not turning into a walker I remember that Rick gave Carl a blood transfusion when Carl was shot If the Walking Dead directors are moving the plot line forward to showing the audience that there is hope for a cure It's a way out and something to definitely watch for.,-0.9777,170
