"Emmy, speaking of burgers, if you are ever in northeastern Ohio, a great place to check out is Smoke the Burger Joint. This is a local place, and they have some really unique, interesting recipes as well as different fry seasonings and milkshakes. I had a malted milk ball shake once that was amazing. The atmosphere is kind of quirky, too. There are TV's that play music videos instead of a radio. I've only been there a few times, sadly, but it's completely worth checking out of you're ever in the area! If I'm not mistaken, I believe the same person/people who own Smoke also own a barbeque place called Old Carolina as well as a quirky surf-n-turf place (not sure what to call it) called Baja West Coast Kitchen. I highly recommend both of those as well.",0.9706,159

I pretty much already know what a burger tastes like. There wasn’t as much unique content in this video as she normally has. I have nothing against paid sponsorships because YouTube is becoming very hard to make a good living from. I just think given it was sponsored, she could have added a twist to the video; maybe ordered something with unique ingredients. Practically anything else would have been more interesting. At the very least I wish she’d mentioned herself where the food came from instead of me having to read it in the comments. I’ve always enjoyed Emmy’s videos but this one missed the mark for me. I’ll continue to support her because she’s 99% awesome.",0.9446,174

"No disrespect to Emmy (as I'm a huge fan), but I feel like the introduction in this video is lacking. If the restaurant is called BURGER, she could say ""I ordered from a restaurant called BURGER."" If she can't say the name of the restaurant, she could just say ""This is from a restaurant near me."" and possibly add ""I'm not going to say the name of it."" Instead she's like ""Here's some food. I'm going to eat it,"" It's like doing a movie review and saying ""The acting was really good,"" but not telling what movie you're talking about.
For those of you who are like ""It's about GrubHub, so it doesn't matter where the food's from,"" I disagree. What if a paid promotion by AMC theaters said ""I just saw a movie at AMC. The acting was good,"" and still didn't say the name of the movie. AMC is the way the product got to you. They have nothing to do with the quality of the product. So if you're making a video about the quality of a product, it's best to tell what the product is. But if she can't say the name of the restaurant, she could at least give a little more info about this test. People in the comments have said that the restaurant is called BURGER, but if that's the case, Emmy didn't make it clear.",0.9056,275
"No disrespect, and I totally get doing sponsorships, but you typically tie them into your videos so seamlessly. This was the most convoluted video of yours I’ve ever seen. Even the part where you’re like “I don’t like waiting, let me know what’s going on” seemed so unlike you that it was weird. Plus, it wasn’t clear that the restaurant was called Burger, so everything you ate was confusing and out of context. Love you! This one just didn’t quite work for me.",0.9184,108
"No matter how you phrase things or what you do or say, you make everything you do or eat so classy!! I love that and adore you.",0.9063,31
"No offense, Emmy, but you should probably switch to ordering from several places, and reviewing the delivery, in these videos.  Doing them like a review of the place you ordered from (especially when that gets left out) just seems like a waste of time, and kind of frustrating to the viewers.

Also, it's unfortunate that this sponsorship couldn't be for the superior OrderUp, which Grub Hub took over.  At least they knew how to include simple - yet often very necessary - tools, such as the ability to separately input your card name and billing address from the name and address for the delivery.",0.0285,118

"So this is about Grub Hub & not necessarily about the actual food? She just ordered food from random restaurants. It just all happened to be burger stuff. I feel like this type of video would have benefited from having other people in the video to eat the food then give there opinions on whether Grub Hub was fast enough, or whether the food was still hot etc. This was just a weird approach is all & it was unclear what this video was about @ 1st, had to rewatch the beginning a few times. 🤷‍♀️",-0.0516,106
"So, here's the thing: The restaurant is NOT called ""Burger"", nor is it the focal point of the ad. She's focusing on the variation that Grubhub offers. If you watched the last video she did of chinese take out which was sponsored by Grubhub, she didn't name the restaurant either. Likely, because she didn't have their permission to feature them, but can say, ""Grubhub brought me a burger I ordered from a burger joint in my area!"". She's pointed out how she appreciated the Grubhub driver for alerting her of their tardiness and about the order, and sampling the food she is essentially showing that Grubhub will bring you quality and not forget somethin you've ordered, or bring it to you looking like a trash fire. I think she did a fine review of Grubhub and it was in no way a failed ad. It gets the points out there fairly easily. There's literally no point in her telling you, ""I got the burger from (burger joint)! Ordered via Grubhub"" only because much of the audience doesn't live in the same area, plus she probably wouldn't wanna give away her exact location which..is possible considering Grubhub brings you food from joints mere miles away.",0.347,235
