"Did i let you down?
did i let you down
when i wasn't around
jaded is an understatement, since you left i've been sedated
i got clean from the codeine, wine and spririts play for keeps
i got attached to your photograph, tears me apart but it brings me back
keep breaking heart in hollywood, i'm an outlaw misunderstood

i know you're sick of the same old record always spinning today and tomorrow
our love was borrowed but i think it deserves a second chance
 
BRENDA i should of never left the west coast
i lost you on the metro
smoke and mirrors got me losing my mind
shed more tears than i southern rain
leave dead rose petals on my grave
BRENDA yeah you drive me crazy but i miss my baby tonight

karma killed a relationship
go through withdrawals you're hard to quit
your body is a masterpiece, your silhouette it haunts my dreams
i got hooked you're my heroin, be my overdose i need a therapist
keep breaking my heart like i knew you would
baby im a rebel but i'll treat you good

i know you're sick of the same old record always spinning today and tomorrow
our love was borrowed but i think it deserves a second chance

BRENDA i should of never left the west coast
i lost you on the metro
smoke and mirrors got me losing my mind
shed more tears than i southern rain
leave dead rose petals on my grave
BRENDA yeah you drive me crazy but i miss my baby tonight

i wanna drive to the california sunset
but when we talk
it feels like we're strangers now
so is it too late?
did i let you down when i'm not around?

BRENDA i should of never left the west coast
i lost you on the metro
smoke and mirrors got me losing my mind
shed more tears than i southern rain
leave dead rose petals on my grave
BRENDA yeah you drive me crazy but i miss my baby tonight 

BRENDA i should of never left the west coast
i lost you on the metro
smoke and mirrors got me losing my mind
shed more tears than i southern rain

"So is this song real were you on codeine and alcohol is that why you decided to color every single bit of your entire skin with tattoos?

You know how stupid little kids look when they color themselves with permanent markers and the parents finally discover them and there's almost not a single patch of unmarked skin... That's how ridiculous grown ups that have that many tattoos look like a little child that got a hold of some permanent markers and doesn't have sense enough to not color all over themselves.

It's a good thing you come from a wealthy family because when you get that many tattoos all it says is completely unemployable and I make terrible decisions so don't ever trust me",-0.6207,127
