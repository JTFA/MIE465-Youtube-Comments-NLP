"Alyce Cho who are you to say that she's not doing ""Korean"" right?? How would you feel if someone from Korea Korea told you that you weren't Korean enough because you're korean-American?

Hey Jenn - do you think you'll do any Eggie Christmas giveaways?,0.0,13
"Hi Jenn,

I’m a Korean-American, like you, and I’ve been watching for the past 4 years seeing you grow as a blogger. I’ve watched your vlogs about your eggie line and I feel that there may be times when you overstep and unknowingly try to appropriate Korean culture. It’s great that you want to be in tune with Korean culture, as I do as well, but when you use 왼쪽 or 오른쪽, 화이팅, 오뎅, or refer to your tank tops as “k-tanks”, i dont think these effectively represent anything about Korean culture and do no help in letting the world know more about Korea. If you are going to use korean words, I would hope you consider, as a Korean, would you really wear a sweater that has 왼쪽 or 오른쪽 on it? P.S.* 오른쪽 is spelled without a space.",0.8988,171
