"You're not alone. It's one of the hardest sports to follow on TV because even the cameramen can lose that little black disc zipping around the rink at freeway speeds or higher.

Mostly what happens is that you watch the game long enough and you start subconsciously reading where the puck is with little cues every now and again to correct by if you're off. It's things like how players move when they've got the puck, following trajectories for when it gets lost along the near boards or behind players, watching where all the players are watching, tracking the refs.

It sounds complicated, but you're doing all of that subconsciously, so it's not about learning so much as it is about exposure.
