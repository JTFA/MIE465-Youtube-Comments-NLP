"Artificial gravity is the bending of spacetime by someone (though tech) other than through mass density by nature. Simulated gravity is simulating the effects of gravity without bending the spacetime (such as a constantly-accelarating spaceship at 1g).

As far as we know artificial gravity is impossible, only used by sci-fi authors to get around the pesky problem of lack of gravity inside spaceships.",-0.7351,71

"I think the audio leads the video slightly; which might feel a lot stranger than audio lagging. The animation looks like 12 fps and I'm wondering if 24 fps lip flaps would make it smoother? For reference though, Dragonball Z Abridged videos just seem to have 12 fps flaps and the sync seems fine, but the DB animation during dialogue has nowhere near the expressiveness as this.",0.1531,73
I think they use a bit of 3d painting so it is more faster to produce,0.0,16
I understand what you're saying. It's just the effect of pretending to have gravity by creating centrifugal force. I think the issue is people don't realize Gravity is an actual energy. Many people don't realize that Gravity is something that exists as a type of field and all centrifugal force does is simulate the effect. It's not gravity in any sense of the word except that it has the same result.,0.5719,76

Yes, they're different forces, but this is largely the point.",0.631,72

"Mark Rippetoe already solved this problem, but NASA ignored him.

https://startingstrength.com/resources/forum/mark-rippetoe-q-and-a/18504-brilliant-exercise-scientists-nasa.html

The problem is the lack of resistance in space, and this ""stressor"" causes an adaptation of atrophy. Therefore, fix the problem: introduce resistance to build muscle. The stressor needs to be specific to the desired outcome, or adaptation. https://startingstrength.com/training/why-fives-for-strength-training

The remark about exercising for 2 hours highlights a profound lack in understanding and ignorance how to promote muscular hypertrophy using resistance:
https://startingstrength.com/training/strength-and-endurance

Using resistance bands on a simple rack is the solution, as described here:
https://startingstrength.com/article/the_ultimate_strength_exercise

Resistance bands:
https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-shorty-monster-bands

Perform exercises like this bud with the bands instead of weights:
