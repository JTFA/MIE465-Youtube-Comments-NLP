"I just didn't like this performance, it felt non-halftime show like. One of the main parts of a halftime show is that it's meant to resemble a concert in a way. This felt more like a movie musical with the different room during the beginning, a large number of extra people ( multiple sets of instrument players ) and the hundreds of different dancers. Halftime shows typically also known for having their performer change their costume multiple times throughout the show. However, I didn't see a single costume change during Timberlake's performance ( excluding taking off and putting back on a jacket a few times ). Finally, halftime shows are known for having messages, with Timerlake's performance, I saw no real overall message. 

Overall, I feel they tried to do too much. It was skippy and it moved in a lot of different directions multiple times. They should have just stuck with one specific message and played that. 

Please feel free to dispute and argue my comments, but try to keep it mature. PS, Lady Gaga's halftime show for the win",0.8039,200

I like to see the nay sayers dance, sing, make their mark at all the locations. Also, as far as Prince, HE WAS TOLD TO DO THAT BY HIGHER UP, maybe Pepsi? Sheila E said it was a great performance, no holograms, and as far as the symbol it was beautiful. What the hell he was in Minneapolis, anyone would have to do something, example, if in Gary Indiana, Michael Jackson. So get a grip and 😉",0.5145,129
