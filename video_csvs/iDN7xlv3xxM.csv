"THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME ONCE BEFORE ON ACCIDENT LMFAO. This is going to be kind of long, enjoy haha.

 I was going to South Africa, and lost my wallet during my day trip in Chicago before catching my flight. I had an overnight layover in Dubai, luckily the airline got me a hotel with breakfast in the morning, but I had no wifi because you had to pay for the wifi at the hotel. Had to convince a random taxi to give me a free ride to my hostel. Really sketchy, but I made it. And once I made it, I had to beg them to let me stay the night without the deposit until I could pay it in the morning when I figured out my money situation. That night I ended up meeting up with a friend from instagram at a hotel on the beach after finding out they had Uber in Cape Town and luckily I had my card linked and the app set up already. They got me dinner, and a ride back to my hostel. Morning time came around after staying up all night talking and getting to know each other, made it to a Western Union and contacted someone from home to send me some money. It was wild to say the least. Watching this was hilarious and very nostalgic. Definitely gave me a good laugh. Keep doing what you guys do!",0.9862,261
