Galantis is killing it again with this track! Makes me can't wait for summer!

So, I am a beginner producer and I have made a track called ""Peanut Butter"". Here's the link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiwrTu7Xqz8
I hope you guys like it (if it is so, then please hit the like button) and if you have some comments and suggestions (I am still new to producing) please comment!

Thank you guys, I hope you don't get bothered by this comment :)",0.9509,95

"I love Galantis' music so much honestly. The first time I heard them was during class. We had free time and we were allowed to play music, so my friend started playing Peanut Butter Jelly. The very moment I heard that song I immediately loved it. When I went home that day I listened to Peanut Butter Jelly constantly, then I discovered Runaway, Firebird, Call if you need me, and a whole lot of other songs that I absoloutely enjoy. Thankyou so much you guys, you have changed my life so much. Whenever I feel down, your music is my first pick. I always feel like singing and jumping around whenever I hear your songs, they're so catchy!",0.9805,135
