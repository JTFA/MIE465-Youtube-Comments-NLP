"Building A Righteous Bod: 5 Commandments Of Smart Dieting

To see the best results from any diet plan, you‚Äôve got to know the ‚ÄúDiet Commandments‚Äù. These guidelines are essential for superior results. They will take you to the Promised Land, flowing with good health and energy.

Sadly, many dieters miss out on one or more of these rules, and it costs them their success.

Thou Shall Eat More Protein
Of all the foods you might eat while on a fat loss diet, protein is probably the most important. Protein combats hunger, stabilizes blood glucose levels, and prevents lean muscle loss. The result is raised metabolism and accelerated fat loss.

Don‚Äôt let your protein intake fall short. Aim to consume some in every meal and snack. For some unexpected sources of protein, consider quinoa, bulgur, avocado, and whole wheat bagels.

Thou Shall Eat Regularly
You may have heard that metabolism increases the more often you eat. That‚Äôs somewhat misleading. Actually, the boost you get from a meal is directly related to meal size ‚Äî eating regularly does help keep hunger at bay.

Feed your body frequently throughout the day to avoid food cravings and energy lows. Those who follow this guideline are more likely to stick to their diet or weight loss program.

Thou Shall Prioritize Fresh Foods
When selecting your foods, remember processed foods are a sin. Eating fresh is a must. In our world, processed foods are around every corner, waiting to cause weight gain and thwart our efforts for a healthy life.

Eliminate processed food and give your diet a major boost. Focus on natural foods, like fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and oils, and lean proteins. This isn‚Äôt the Garden of Eden‚Äîreaching for the apple is the right choice.

You could call this commandment the Golden Rule of dieting. If you make only one change to your diet plan, make this one.

Thou Shall Set Short Term Goals
One diet rule that you should abide by is to continually set short term goals. Think about your strategy in the here and now, not months ahead. If your goals can only be achieved far down the road, it becomes too easy to lose sight of them.

You should also ensure that you put your goals in writing and tell a friend or family member about your intentions. The accountability will redouble your commitment.

Try thinking in two-week segments. Two weeks is generally the period necessary to form good habits, so it‚Äôs the perfect amount of time to build behaviors that stand the test of time.

This is precisely why The 2 Week Diet was created. It will help you stay motivated and consistent until good decisions become automatic.

Thou Shall Avoid Fruitless Comparisons
Finally, stop comparing yourself to others. Realize this is your journey. Your body is unique and you won‚Äôt see the same results as everyone else, so don‚Äôt expect to.

Instead, start comparing yourself today to yourself from yesterday. That will give you everything you need to know. If you improve every day, or hold fast to your diet program, then you are already a success.

Keep these diet commandments in mind. Focus on them and be confident you are building a truly righteous body.

"Wow the diet they're forced to follow is sooo unnecessary. Whoever made this up clearly knows very little about nutrition. The person takes out way too much food that isn't even bad! There's no way these models are getting in all their nutrition to fuel their body. There's so much easier, better, and healthier ways to do this!! Ah that's terrible that the company is putting these women through starvation. And my personal opinion, I don't find the 'ideal' bodies their meant to have attractive. Idk it just makes me mad that they're being forced through this for their job.",0.6671,114
