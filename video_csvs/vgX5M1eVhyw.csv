*Just curious* -- Rather than using the sugar mix at the end before scooping them up and putting it on a baking tray. Could you not use some syrup or maple syrup and turn it into a flapjack??? Im sure you could easily turn this recipe into a flapjack. add some honey or maple syrup. throw in some dried fruits that have been put through a food processor or berries (or both) and you have yourself a pretty amazing flapjack right there.,0.905,94

"Egor Trubnikov its granules are bigger so it packs much looser in measuring spoons and results in the right amount of saltiness. If you ever read a recipe that says “1 tsp salt” it almost always means kosher, it’s pretty much used universally in cooking and ESPECIALLY in baking! If you’re baking and you see 1 tsp of salt but don’t have kosher, use 1/4 tsp of regular salt, since the grains are so small and it’s much more concentrated 😁",0.3382,96
