"Doug, you really need to learn some automotive history before you shoot your mouth off. You just look ignorant and indifferent to the car you are reviewing. 

1). This car was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, NOT Marcello Ghandini (he designed the 2nd gen, deTonaso- era Ghibli, based on the horrific Bi-Turbo). 

2). An 8?? Really, all you are doing here is admitting your own complete lack of artistic sensibility. That this is one of the 10 most beautiful automobiles ever designed is - objectively - without question. By anyone but you, that is. 

3). The twin 13 gallon fuel tanks were necessary because a 26 gallon tank would not have fit within that ‚Äú#8‚Äù design. 

4) Those ARE the rear seats, not fillers to make the rear flat. It was marketed as a 2+2 for tax & insurance reasons.

5). Pop-up headlights were hardly unique to 80‚Äôs design.  How about almost every Corvette since 1963? A 53 Siata with Boano body? A 1967 Thunderbird,  1968 Mercury Cougar XR/7, or 1969 Lincoln Conti? A 68 Opel GT? A 67 De Tomaso Mangusta (another Giugiaro design)?  Or how about a frackin 1936 Cord 810/812???
