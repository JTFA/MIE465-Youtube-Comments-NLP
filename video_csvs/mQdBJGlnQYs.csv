"I believe there is true science and fake science, or scientism, a fake religion disguised as science. For the most part what the mass media teaches is false in order to hide the existence of God. I personally believe the Bible is 100% truth and that more recently with the release of television since the 1920's they have managed to lie to everyone, the created televisions exactly for the reason of mind control. There's patents and all kinds of proof of this info/facts. I haven't met Jesus my self, but I think he is God, he created everything because he was bored and we're here for his purpose. I've been doing lots of research to disprove or to further prove and from what I can find is that the book is all true. How would those men thousands of years ago be able to predict so many years ahead is beyond me, it's not for me to understand because I didn't create life, but the breather of life does understand, so I just have to have faith. While doing flat earth research I realized how lost most Christians are, actually most are fake Christians, they believe a lot of lies, but that's not to say their aren't real Christians out there. Also I started to understand the Bible better and learn so much awesome stuff along the way. I believed in the globe lie for 37 years, and once I learned this info it really improved my existence and my being, I don't get depressed anymore and I don't waste my time thinking about vain things like girls and cars and just so much shit that doesn't really matter. Plus I found out about things like how to see through lies, it really improved my being in that I'm not as trusting anymore, so I don't get screwed over like I used to get screwed before when I was too trusting or gullible because I didn't know any better. I'm still doing research but overall I would recommend everyone do research because the government can't be trusted and if they know the truth, which they do, but keep lying to us, there must be a reason, it's up to us to figure out what that is and also to stand up against the system, doing research just helps over all to stand up against this evil, all those bastards are players and they can't be trusted, they playing us like a fiddle, television is just mind control. I remember growing up I used to watch a lot of Disney and Nickelodeon and well that shit just fucked me up, and I didn't realize for so many years why my life was going the way it was going until I started to do the research and things started to add up. Luckily I didn't die before learning this stuff or I would have never known, like a lot of people who get brainwashed and never wake up from the ""american dream"". It's very liberating and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Along the way you may go back and forth and change your mind about stuff, like oh maybe hitler was a good guy, oh no he wasn't or so many other things, but then when you learn even more you end up being able to see what up much faster, just have to keep going and know that nothing is set in stone, facts are facts, and history has been rewritten, but those who re-wrote it aren't gods they just people and people make mistakes, so we just have to find their mistakes and dig around the haystack for that needle, truth is like a drug, once you find it you want it more and more.",0.9684,685

"I lost my grandpa a year ago. He raised me, and I called him dad. It’s been so very hard, and there is never anything anyone can say to make it hurt less.....but a warm hug and making sure we surround ourselves with people who love us is great therapy for the heart. Of course, sometimes we want to grieve alone, and that’s ok, too. At times, I cry in the shower when I’ve had a rough day. For a while, I didn’t cry for months; but all of a sudden, on the anniversary of his passing, I broke down and cried in the shower two days in a row. Sometimes, you think you are doing so good living with the sad reality of their absence, but the next second it could hurt so bad all over again. It’s so weird....to grieve. It truly never ends until, well....the end. I know you probably won’t read this....but I guess this is me grieving right now on this video, because your video truly saddened me for the both of us.",-0.9733,222

"To Ellen....
BECAUSE IN THIS LIFE

When the world takes you down 
And a true friend can’t be found
I will come to you
I will help you get through

When people around you
Are too far away
I’ll be close to you
Here today

Like a ship
That comes home from the sea
May this song
Bring you to me

Because in this life
We need sweet music
Because in this life
We all need a song
Because in this life
We need love
Because in this life
There’s too much too far gone



I know you’re out there
Feeling pain
I have been there myself
Feeling ashamed
To reach out to somebody
Come and take my hand
Put your arms around me
To understand


I wasn’t raised that way
To turn my head and look away
All along the watchtower
Too many waiting for the kill
For what they can take from you
We need to be still

All along the watchtower
The hour is getting late
I don’t know what happened to you
I want no part of hate

There’s a world full of lies
I want someone to look in my eyes
Bring me some paradise
Take me back now
Because in this life
Someday we’ll say goodbye
Sister and brother
Let’s love one another
