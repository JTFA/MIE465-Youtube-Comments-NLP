"00:16-00:30 i appreciate the guitar music behind it all and the vocals are quite interesting

00:31-00:57 is gonna be one of my favorite tracks I can tell already the vocals behind it and lyrics are sick

All in all there is not a Justin album I am not not ever impressed with and I am sure I will dive in and love it all the same,I am curious though as to which song Pharrell says is a “smack” and if that’s the track he has worked(along with many on the album) and is featured on

All in all,Psyched out of my mind already for this album and the 3 other tracks we will get before the album comes out

It’s just Justin ya’ll🤷‍♂️😭👌💵😁👊",0.9365,149

"No, we've come to the point where the music industry is putting out music that sounds like other music because it will make a quick sale. I know many pop artists draw from musical influences, but they still find a way put their own creative stamp on it. JT doesn't do that. For example, when I first heard ""Rock Your Body"", I didn't think ""Oh, this is Justin Timberlake with some Michael Jackson influence.""  I thought ""Is this a new Michael Jackson song?"" That's the difference. I know it sounds like a small thing, but it makes a huge difference.",0.928,119

Guaranteed this is what Justin is going for, with the more modern MV's and classical music backing it up on the album",0.0516,85
