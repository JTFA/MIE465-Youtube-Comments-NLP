"A waste of time artificial Hollywood Catholic style forbidden love story camouflaged in a so called 'orthodox jewish' setting.  All the Jewish scenes I see here in the trailer are fake as are almost all depictions of observant Jews, always portrayed with fake beards, fake prayer and family scenes.  In Judaism, while marriage is preferred, it is incumbent upon men as a law to fulfill (man should not live alone, he shall take a help mate).  If two women wish to live together, while it is frowned upon, is not expressly forbidden in the Torah.  The prohibition in the Torah specifically refers to men living intimately with men.   

Dont waste your time with this artifical plastic depiction that is not real. If you want to see real Judaism portrayed by real people watch the movie Ushpizin, portrayed by a real observant married couple.  There are other better portrayals as well.",-0.2406,170

Well just let you know, there are people who claim that serial killers like Ted Bundy, Ed Gein, Gary Ridgway, Jeffrey Dahmer, Richard Speck, and others were born to kill.- If that's true, does that make murder okay because they were born that way?Of course not. You'd have to be an idiot to believe such a thing. So that really throws mud on the view that people are born that way so that makes alright.If the sodomite queers don't repent of their sin and turn to Christ, they will NOT be accepted into God's kingdom.
