Losin' my patience
Why you keep me waitin'?
Goin' through the phases

Just in case I see your face and you decide to run up
Yea I'm in a different place, I need someone to hold on to
I been sendin' up a prayer hope the call gets through

I wonder if you even notice

Feel the weight of the world like I got a brick on me
Had a dance with the devil and he got a grip on me
I'm just tryna get to heaven, hope you got a ticket for me, huh
If I'm Lois Lane, where's my Superman?
I need you faster than a bullet or a speedin' train
And when you find your way to me then I won't need a thing
And I can't wait until the day that we can meet again
