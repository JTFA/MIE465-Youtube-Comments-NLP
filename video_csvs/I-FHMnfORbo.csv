"Dear friends Jesus Christ loves you so much. He wants you to give your life to Him today and worship only Him. Whatever occupies your mind the most becomes your god. Worries, if indulged develop into idols. Anxiety gains a life of its own, parasitically infesting your mind. Break free from this bondage by affirming your trust in Jesus. Jesus knows every single thing about you and what your thoughts are. He rejoices when your mind turns towards Him. Have complete faith in the power and the love of Jesus Christ. Guard your thoughts diligently; good thoughts-choices will always keep you close to our Lord and Savior. ❤️❤️❤️ (Psalm 112:7;  1 John 5:5;  Galatians 2:20;  Corinthians 13:11)",0.9841,140

"I bought the snail cream moisturizer and for my peeps who are not acne prone and like to watch Fei because she is goals, let me tell you my thoughts. I have dry to normal skin. This snail cream really does absorb into your skin and does not leave the sticky feeling like Fei said, but it leaves your skin feeling really dry! I bought it thinking i can use it as my nightly moisturizer but i come to find that i need to apply a second cream in order for my face to not feel so dry. I am going to keep using it as a replacement for my toner and see if my skin changes for the better. Trying it out for myself, i can see how people with oily skin would really like this! Anyways, if you have dry skin like me, don't expect to have your face feeling nice and moisturized!",0.965,167

After high school I started washing my face with WATER only . You know the stuff that comes out of the faucets ? My skin cleared up in about a week. I get a zit here and there , but for the most part my skin is very clear. When it gets dry I use another product called WATER . My skin is  barely ever dry.",0.4215,121

"Your skin has improved so much since you don't use shitty masks and start using oils, creams, etc.
I have deep acne scars and I use a non-oily mousturizer when I wake up. I deeply cleanse my skin before i go to sleep with Bioré Active Carbon cleanser and then I put on my face rosehips 100% natural oil, when I wake up in the morining my skin looks glowy, fresh and renewed. Twice a week I use green clay mask, in powder composition, not a creamy one. By following this steps my acne has desappeared, the excess oil of my skin is now balanced and my acne scars are slowly bluring. Of course this is not a miracle and super fast method, but I feel this worked on me, super cheap and it don't get too much time for a skin routine. Try out without a deep cleansing if you have active acne, if you peel your skin while you have active acne it will increase your acne severly, just clam down your skin and mousturize it a lot.
This is my experience with acne and acne scars. I have seen tons of videos for years about acne and I feel yours now are the best ones to follow if you have active acne or you want to deal with acne scars. I will try the microneedling soon.
Hope I help someone with this long sh*t text XD
