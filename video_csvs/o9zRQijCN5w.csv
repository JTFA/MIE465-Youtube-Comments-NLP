"(Bridge; Rag'n'Bone Man)
We're broken people now
We're burning out
So cold and bleeding out, now, now
Gonna let you down

We're broken people now
We're broken people now

(Verse 1; Logic)
Tell me I won't ever be nothing
Ain't that something
I've risen from the bottom
I got 'em eyes on the prize and inside 'em
D*** right I overcame, y'all know the name
We similar but never been the same
Everybody yeah they know the name, right now

We'll make it somehow
We'll make it someway
Yeah you know we 'gon get it today like
I'm all on my own now
We won't ever let you down
We won't let you down
Down, down

(Pre-Chorus; Logic)
Yes, I've been through it
They know I do it, for the people
I'm fighting so we be equal
For my son and my sequel
And anybody who listenin'
In they system like venom
I got 'em in and spread viciously
This is me

(Chorus; Rag'n'Bone Man)
We're broken people now
We're burning out
So cold and bleeding out, now, now
We're gonna let you down
We're broken people now

(Verse 2; Logic)
We back it, young Logic the rap addict
Giving it every part of myself on the real
You think I would be azmatic
Allergic to your b******* 
Yeah, that's right I done had it
Real all the time if you rep it get it tatted right now

This right here a vibe right now
I am too alive right now
I'm alive right now
Come and feel the vibe right now
Feel the vibe, feel the vibe
Feel the, feel the, feel the, feel the vibe

(Pre-Chorus; Logic)
Yes, I've been through it
They know I do it, for the people
I'm fighting so we be equal
For my son and my sequel
And anybody who listenin'
In they system like venom
I got 'em in and spread viciously
This is me

(Chorus; Rag'n'Bone Man)
We're broken people now
We're burning out (Burning out)
So cold and bleeding out, now, now
We're gonna let you down

(Bridge; Rag'n'Bone Man)
Broken we ain't beaten
There's no glory in defeat
We won't fall into the cracks between our streets
We're broken people now
We're broken people now

(Chorus; Rag'n'Bone Man)
We're broken people now
We're burning out
So cold and bleeding out, now, now
We're gonna let you down
We're broken people now
