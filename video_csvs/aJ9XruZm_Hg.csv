"Am I only person who is leaving that comment that ISN'T British or American?
Anyway, I don't see what the fault is, here. The show being overly scripted was present in the final seasons of Top Gear... before the BBC fucked up.
A lot of the people saying ""Make this Great British again"" or along those lines haven't gotten past the first few seasons of Top Gear, before it became the phenomenon it was.
And even then, this is the kind of stuff the boys would find fun. Just because they're British does not mean they are stiff-upper-lipped snobs that think everyone else is a poor scum.

The more accurate description of them is as 3 middle-aged oafs that just muck about.
No offence to them, obviously.

The only thing that shouldn't be scripted are the cheap car challenges...
Just let the car be the star of the show; let its own personality shine, and not be marred by an artificial one. That was the reason they worked in the first place.",-0.6399,193

Clarkson himself rants about how light-hearted the relationship is between England and Australia but makes a point to say it isn't the same with England and the States. THIS IS WHY. Purposefully hateful reactions like this. Almost as if you're implying any of us average Americans watching this think it's any better than you do...or have anything to do with it for that matter. We think it's terrible too. We ALL clicked this for the same reason, because we love the show and old Top Gear. You Brits have a brand of humor...sorry 'humour' all your own, and trust me, us EVERYDAY, SANE, Americans appreciate it. We want the trio to stay British. And we want them to keep doing what they've always done best. Uninterrupted. Uninfluenced.  So we can sit in the corner quietly and enjoy by ourselves. And treasure our secret that hasn't been discovered in America. Just like we always have. We know our country has a reputation for being brash, for being generally commercialized and soul-less. We know you hate us because of things you see on the news. A lot of us don't care. I happen to. So maybe, just for once, lighten up and let us all agree the boys have this under control and leave it at that? So we can all continue to enjoy their collective genius together?

To those ""Across the pond"", The Grand Tour is produced by Americans, and funded by an American company, they try to keep Jeremy, James, and Richard's charms in tact. Us Americans find their shenanigans quite funny, hence why it was ultimately an American company that carried the torch after the Top Gear fiasco.
