Hi. As a baccalaureate professor of sex education,Muslimity and English language I have made some research about this man, let this be in a mosque, on a tree, on my eagle, on the tower of London... So many places!! 
After years of research, I am in an opinion that his enigmatic code  love is actually for men.
So I think he is in fact GAY!!

So friends, The Lord loves you, truly. 

Jesus also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so come to Him today! 

All you need is faith as a mustard seed, and words from the heart. He will hear you when you call upon Him, and He will save you when you do! Hallelujah!
