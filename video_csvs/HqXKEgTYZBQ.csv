ISPs are going to put websites into slow lane blocks and fast lane blocks. Using tech like blockchain. It will be an internet of Blocks. ISPs will be able to carve up the internet putting different websites on slower or faster blocks. Its like a layer that sits over the normal broadband layer. All this so ISPs can make more money out of everybody online both normal customers and big businesses such as AMazon, Netflix, facebook, ISPs will start charging websites to be on fast or slow lane blocks. ISPs will also be able to block some parts of the internet if it is not sitting on a block it allows, so no more free internet. ISPs  rule & internet will be controlled.

"Lazzy Cat

""Well I'm glad that I'm European.""

Oh really? Me too. But how do I get affected then and you don't? Well, let me explain it nice and easy for you.

This one INFURIATES me the most. I myself live in the UK and let me explain how it works. Google, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook are ALL from the U.S. That means 'us' the people in the UK (and to the countries with net neutrality) will have to pay the cost to those companies that aren't getting any money because the ISPs will take their profits from each person trying to do a Google search because of the control they have over those companies and us. WE will have to help fund them because we will be the only few left that will be able to use their websites. To which point we can't really 'fund' them considering they aren't even in charge of their own websites since the ISPs will be in charge of them instead.

You know what else ISPs are taking from them? The website search speed they give you, are going to be in the hands of the ISPs instead Because of this, they won't be able to provide ongoing website services for people anymore. ISPs are going to throttle their companies to the point were they might as well take down their websites, because the ISPs are the new handlers. I call that 'net control'. The reason these companies love net neutrality is because these companies get the profit from the ISPs instead of the ISPs taking the profit from them.",0.9736,305

"Many people nowadays depend on the internet, from information to entertainment to even running businesses based on the web. If you have loads of competition to choose from and your ISP doesn't honor net neutrality, you can easily switch providers. But in the U.S, we have a competition problem: 50 million homes here only have one ISP provider to choose from. In fact, where I live, I only have two ISPs: Altice/Suddenlink (Cable) and CenturyLink (DSL). That's it. So, U.S. consumers only have two options: either stick with their ISP or go without the internet completely, the latter option being devastating to many consumers. So, this is why many consumers, in the end, stick with their ISP, no matter how much they get ripped off by them.",-0.7599,159

"Net neutality is also possibly and very likely going to be the death of the covernment controlled world. Reasoning given below.

$$$$$Long story short, richest commpanies rule the world and covernments through dept$$$$$

Unfair Throtteling system is going to give the top 100 riches commpanies(in stock market) an edge versus the rest. Stock matket is the key. Why? cause throtteling is going to effect directly to the commpanies stock values, by lowering them, so the larger commpanies can buy them out when they are cheap. How? By larger commpanies being able to buy more bandwhight than the smaller ones, and therefore forcing them on a slowlane that they aren't able to buy themselves out of. Less space to operate, slower the business and even less customers will force them to undersell their stocks, which the large commpanies will in turn buy, and connect them in value to their own stocks in turn causing an influx of value, because they are now permanently part of this larger corporation and are only now getting their prodict out there.

Picking which small commpanies are going to be the first ones to go under-raidar is the job meant for the corrupt internet providers, in order to avoid ""total firesale""(complete economical collapse) only a few at the time. Slowly but surely smaller commpanies start to fuse into the larger ones until there are only a hand full of super corporations left that the covernment cannot control because of their massive influence. Adding the fact that a corporations can now buy off the USA:s debt and through that debt they now own all of covernment and turn their money filled eyes toward the rest of the world.

So the end result is that the few mega corporations are going to overthrow the regular covernment rule by amassing absurd amount of wealth and ruling the world through debt. Yes I know that I sound like a fearmonger, but the apple never falls to far from the tree, or in this case the truth. World is a greedy place, so it is better to always know the worst cased scenarion and prepair for it and also to never to forget YOUR worth as wealth is fleeting but you will always in the end remain one way or the other.",0.9774,424

""Mostly Trumps fault"".

In 2011, Pai was then nominated for a Republican Party position on the Federal Communications Commission by President Barack Obama at the recommendation of Minority leader Mitch McConnell. He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 7, 2012, and was sworn in on May 14, 2012, for a term that concluded on June 30, 2016. Then Pai was designated chairman of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January 2017 for a five-year term. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for the additional five-year term on October 2, 2017.

Obama put this guy into to position that he was able to rise from, while also knowing he's against net neutrality. A member of the FFC into the chairmanship. And with all of the stuff that Obama quote on quote did to protect net neutrality. He put a loaded gun into the seat and waited for the trigger to be pulled.

"This is a pretty good breakdown of the debate on net neutrality. The one big point I think this video failed to bring home is that ISPs pay to maintain and create the infrastructure that supports the internet. When companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix don't have to pay for the extra resources they take up, that endangers ISPs' ability to make enough money to incentivize continued innovation and investment in that infrastructure. That's why the FCC stopped treating phone companies and ISPs like common carriers; net neutrality endangers ISPs' economic and innovative incentives for doing business.

The existence of ISP monopolies is a BIG DEAL for the average consumer, and for the stability of our increasingly-internet-dependent economy. But average consumers aren't the ones endangering the profitability of ISPs' business. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix that take up more than the amount of resources than they pay for are the real problem.

As a policy, net neutrality has its heart in the right place by trying to protect average consumers. But net neutrality doesn't get at the real heart of the issue, which is that big internet companies are not paying their fair share.",0.9645,216
