Well, when I was in line at Target for the Switch's launch event, I took my GPD WIN with me. Naturally, the people at first thought it was a 3DS. That is, until they saw the game I was playing and realized it wasn't a 3DS. I felt pretty badass playing Call of Duty MW3 online while waiting on my switch and having people watching and asking how I'm playing Call of Duty on a freaking HANDHELD! 

Best part? I didn't stand out... much. lol but if I'd taken a laptop... Well, you know...

"People should not complain about the keyboard or mouse because you can just use a wireless keyboard and mouse on it.

The real remaining question about this beauty is the durability or the buttons and damage resistance of the screen.

What happens when you drop it from a certain altitude.
What happens with the R buttons after extensive usage, lets say 6 months.

Other then that I think this product is underrated. Being skeptical is fine but for something so small handling most medium games like a pro should be more then enough.

Hopefully in the future they will work on a GPD Win 3 with even better specs then the previous but that depends on their budget and the succes of this product they are selling.",0.9617,135
"Personally I love these things and all the PCs in this form factor. And it might seem to be for a weird reason. Productivity via portability. Let me clarify; I use an ancient Acer Aspire One D257 because it's tiny and I don't have to haul a full size laptop places just to check emails or watch Xbox video movies & shows. Gaming? Useless. But after some upgrades its a fair little trooper. Swap the 1gb single ram stick for a 2gb one (sadly the mobo can't see more than that), replace the 240gb 5400rpm hdd with a 2tb 7200rpm hdd. (wish I could afford an ssd), replace the 4400mah battery with a 6600mah one and replace Windows Vista with Windows 10. Still useless for gaming but awesome for emailing on the road or watching movies or doing research...or just watching YouTube videos. üòÅ
So that's what I would use this for myself. I dont need a full sized laptop. My wife has my old one because I just don't use it. I have a couple of desktop pcs and my netbook. But I'd LOVE a GPD WIN2. Streaming Steam games when my wife wants me to sit by her during movies or even playing my favorite older titles on the go would be great. But having a windows 10 pc that fits in my pocket or my tiny camera backpack would be a great tool for working on the go. Better than a smartphone in some ways.",0.9899,276
