"*Discussion* : what do you think about the end of this chapter? To me it was not a happy ending, but quite the opposite, because as we could see, infinite copies of the '' consciousness '' of oneself can be made. That is to say, there is no soul or anything similar, only recorded electrical impulses. It is as if you were singing a song and recording it in an '' .mp3 '' file. It seems that you are you, but you are not, but only a code that can be played countless times. We are not talking about human beings, but only a fiction; that is why they are called '' conscience ''. They have already died, there is only one digitalized recording of electrical reactions; that is also the reason why the government did not close such a museum nor is the owner in prison, because there is no real harm. On the other hand, she is a murderer; Talking about whether the owner of the museum was right or wrong is another debate. (sorry the bad english, i used google translate; I hope you can understand)

*Debate* : si alguien habla espa√±ol, ¬øqu√© le pareci√≥ el final del cap√≠tulo? Para m√≠ no fue un final feliz, sino todo lo contrario, porque como pudimos ver, se pueden hacer infinitas copias de la ''conciencia'' de uno mismo. Es decir, no hay alma ni nada parecido, solo impulsos el√©ctricos grabados. Es como si t√∫ cantaras una canci√≥n y la grabaras en un archivo ''.mp3'' parece que eres t√∫, pero no lo eres, sino solamente un c√≥digo que puede reproducirse infinidad de veces. No estamos hablando de seres humanos, sino solo una ficci√≥n; por eso se llaman ''conciencia''. Ellos ya murieron, solo queda una grabaci√≥n de reacciones el√©ctricas digitalizada; ese es tambi√©n el motivo por el cual el gobierno no cerr√≥ tal museo ni tampoco el due√±o est√° en prisi√≥n, pues no hay da√±o real alguno. En cambio ella s√≠ es una asesina; hablar de si estuvo bien o mal lo que hizo el due√±o del museo ya es otro debate.",-0.9922,422

"Robert Bubb Just because the protagonist gets retribution and gave us a sigh of relief at the end doesn't mean it lacked emotional impact or was ""cheesy"".

I mean the episode itself criticizes the justice system depicted in these BM episodes showing people who commit a crime being punished in ruthless ways but the system failing to do the same to the actual roots of the problem and this episode essentially gives us that satisfaction.

I was getting more and more frustrated so I had an idea. I decided to write down in my journal ""Black Mirror season 4 comes out on April 4, 2019"". Like magic, writing that down made my rabid anticipation for season 4 decrease drastically. I don't know why. I guess by writing down a release date that was over a year away, a small part of my mind believed the fake release date was real so I no longer had that feeling that it could be coming out any day now.

"You guys should know something. I just binged watch the series on Netflix and at the last episode I light up a joint to relax and you when you smoke weed you firgure out some smart ass shit u wouldn‚Äôt of u weren‚Äôt high. Then after I watch this vid I realized something kool. In previous interviews Brooker talks about the entire of season 4 would be about the children still rebellion against the adults. And if u watch all of it from ep 1-5 u notice some child dies in some way that was horrible but in ep 6 u see the child had won the game or they were to adults. And Brooker is all about games that he not only made the children abvove the kids, but this shit. Is like Brooker playin a game wit us and it‚Äôs now 5-1.an",0.0387,157

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
