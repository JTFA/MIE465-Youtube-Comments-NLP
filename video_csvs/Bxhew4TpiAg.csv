"Daniel 7:9

‚ÄúI beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.‚Äù 


Revelation
Chapter 1:

12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;

13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.

14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.

16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.


Song of Solomon 1:5

‚ÄúI am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.‚Äù

Thomas: ""Roman, what's really going on?"" Roman remains silent. ""Okay then, Deceit."" Deceit pops up, quite confused as to why he was summoned. ""Hey, Deceit, could you tell us why Roman was so late?""
Deceit: ""Well, it was definitely not because he was having an argument with one of your 'Dark Sides'.""

So we know that Thomas has more dark sides that we don't know about yet, and a few people think one of them will be his narcissistic side. So as a Prinxiety shipper, I used this idea to find a way to make Prinxiety or Logicality going canon make sense.
So narcissism is pretty much loving yourself. The sides are all parts of Thomas, so they are all technically the same person. So if one side loved another side that would technically be loving THEMSELVES, and tHAT COULD BE THOMAS' FORM OF HIS NARCISSISTIC SIDE AND NOW I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT OF ALL OF THIS",0.9123,125
