I was watching casually at first, knowing it was going to be a good performance, but then the second she emerged from the group with her violin, I was like, ""YAASSS LINDSEY! PLAY THAT VIOLIN GIRL!"" and about 5 seconds after she started playing her solo, right around the hip rolls, I sat up and was on the edge of my seat gripping the arm rests and I said aloud to my mom, ""OMG, they're going to dance while she's playing..."" and she said, ""WHAT?!"" and sure enough, Mark ducked under her arms and my hands went to my hair in shock and amazement and my mom and I both sat there agape watching going, ""WHAT?!

They brought so much to the dance floor and created hands down the most memorable dances in the history of the show. As for Mark... my heart breaks every time he's being treated unfairly on this show... He doesn't just choreograph good dances. He changes the look of modern dancing itself. This year with Lindsey he proved this yet again. He created an outstanding legacy for himself. Yes, i want him to be treated fairly for once but no trophy can define or take away his achievements. Years after this show is done people will look at h i s dances as at examples of perfect choreography. I believe it with all my heart.",0.7541,165

"I love the burlesque theme of Lindsey's clothes. This made me think of how I wish Mark (or any man in this show really) also could have more ""burlesque"" themed clothes (or other more ""revealing"" clothes, that is). Not to be more sexualised, but I'm thinking about what burlesque is about (nowadays). Burlesque is about to show what you can do with your body, no matter how your body look, and to show things like ""Look at those muscles in my legs, look what I can do thanks to them."" or ""See those curves? They make me able to do belly dance."" and things like that.",0.9032,132

Where's the popularity (ppl who weren't already fans), no one is perfect, ofc, but what's not to like?? Lol Linds has been under the microscope longer and deeper than Jordan. Sold out shows for world tour. Why can't America vote for their only (pretty much)  American violinist? And some say ""overrated""... tf??? She's *_underrated_* , thats why she came in 2nd.

Lindsey wanted to prove that she could become a refined dancer and that she was in control of her body, and mark wanted to prove that he still has it, and that he is by far the most creative choreographer the show will ever have. Dwts has consistently treated Mark unfairly by giving him crappy partners, and scoring him low because of how creative his dances are. They finally gave him an amazing parter who is basically the female version of himself yet once again, they were underscored all season while getting little negative feedback.

"There's a lot of debate on that, but I truly believe she played live. ¬†I can't believe it would have been included in the routine as a fake. ¬†Lindsey, who knows how to play while moving, just doesn't roll that fake way. ¬†She once said, in a Youtube video, ""I can't fake play. ¬†It'd look ridiculous.""",-0.0772,68

This dance was my favorite one,0.4588,6
This freestyle is gonna be hard to top next seas on,0.2732,11
This freestyle is the best in DWTS history! Mark is a genius! Love him & Lindsey the mostest the best couple of DWTS!,0.9449,26
This is #29 on Trending and I'm not surprised. I mean.... THAT WAS A MINDBLOWING FREESTYLE!!!!,-0.428,21
This is brilliant. I could watch it all day,0.5859,10
This is by far my favorite dance she's done. I didn't realize how flexible she was!! But their dances are always kind of boring. I don't think Mark took advantage of Lindsey's dancing ability.,0.561,39
This is freaking AMAZING!!!!,-0.6083,7
This is just amazing. I can't stop watching. Pure talent!!,0.8431,14
This is my friends floor music in gymnastics. It‚Äôs amazing,0.7845,13
"This is the Mark-iest Mark freestyle ever! So perfect! Mark and Lindsey were a match made in dancing heaven. I'm bummed they didn't win, but that doesn't take anything away from the brilliance they have left us with over the last 10 weeks. I'll be coming back to these videos for years to come. Love you, #TeamSTARK!",0.9516,65
"This is what happens when you pair two creative geniuses as dance partners. What Lindsey and Mark brought to the stage each week was incredible. Yes, I was rooting for Jordan, but Lindsey has a place in my heart after this season.",0.4215,47
This was actually pretty bad ass :),0.8807,7
This was insane the most amazing dance ƒ±ve ever seen,0.3384,10
This was the best performance on the whole show  I  really wanted you to win an thought you were the best.,0.9217,22
This was the most amazing freestyle dance I have EVER SEEN on this show! Cannot believe that they did not win the Mirror Ball.,0.5092,26
"This will go down in history as iconic. I loved it they were both so entertaining, I also though they would get the mirror ball too, it was that good",0.8895,33
True.  I was thinking he will be the next Michael Grimm from America's Got Talent 2010- the same season that Lindsey competed in.  Jordan is just a cookie cutter industry bimbob pop singer.,0.6808,37
Truly love Lindsey!!!!!!!!!  Should of won.,0.918,10
Ugh Lindsey got robbed. This performance alone should've won her the trophy. America always fucking shit up and voting wrong.,-0.796,23
Ughhhhhhhh why didn‚Äôt Lindsey win üò©,0.5859,8
"WTF bro, if dancing like that wasn't hard enough tehre is she like, oh hey I'm just gonna play this violing while we do some moves.

Hope they win!!",0.8572,34

WoSo Agreed! He trolls everyone that likes Lindsey or thinks Lindsey should have won. He does it like he's paid to do it. Don't give him attention. He craves it too much.,0.8858,37

"Yes, she did!",0.4574,5
"Yes, the music is actually from her violin.  She plays live! 
You can see her literally bending over backwards by herself and still playing the violin.  She's done this on some live performances of Crystallize and Transcendence. 
Seeing her live is really something else.",0.6996,50

absolute maximum of greatest freestyle performance ever mega wow,0.8658,9
at the end did they say their only having 4 weeks in the spring?? I know the show had very awful ratings this season and lost viewers but I didnt think they would contract the show to 4 weeks.,-0.4865,42
best freestyle i have ever seen! deserved to win,0.8748,10
"butterflygirl1987 The only 5 minutes vote idea was so dumb. If the producers pull that 5 minutes voting BS for Season 26, I'm going to be angry.",-0.8196,31
"butterflygirl1987 True, I think they ""the producers"" were using that stupid 5 min voting, because they knew that Lindsey's freestyle was going to get more votes than Jordan's freestyle, and they didn't want her to win. It was like they were playing a dirty trick on Lindsey, just because they wanted Jordan to win.",0.8548,63
"chris! I may have been too harsh, I'll admit, but still this comment wasn't about Jordan so I reacted to that. He was good, just not as versatile in my opinion to get a win. That's my opinion but again, that's not what the comment was about. And Mark got robbed (I sure as hell don't like this word but the meaning fits) so many more times than just when he danced with Paige. If you're going to disagree, please don't respond because I really don't wanna argue with anyone. Everyone has the right to have their own opinions, I'm not trying to change yours.",0.6342,120
chris! Jordan can eat shit. I'm with you nbagametime,-0.5983,11
chris! Ok that's your opinion not others,0.3595,8
chris! Same can be said for you. Good day.,0.4926,12
"chris! That's why I just hate some of Jordan's fan base. Where did it say anything about him? This comment wasn't about him, it was about Mark and it was about Lindsey. If you don't have anything to say about his choreography, please don't answer.",-0.1007,52
chris! Well in ur opinion,0.3382,6
chris! Why are you watching LINDSEY‚ÄôS video if you don‚Äôt like her? Do something better with your time.,0.69,25

dAfoodie101 No it's only online. Vote on Facebook or abc.com right after Lindsey and Mark's fusion dance. It only goes up for 5minutes.,-0.296,27

i've watched this like 50 times and i have no regrets. one of the best freestyles ever performed on this show.,0.5683,23
"idk y ppl are saying it was confusing. it was simple. AND they explained it beforehand. Its supposed to be where conductors get over excited about the music and get caught up in it. When conductors (in real life) get excited, they make certain faces. And I gotta say Mark Ballas has a specialty in that haha",0.765,65
