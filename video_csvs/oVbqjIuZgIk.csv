That's like....that's like having an Avengers Infinity War without a build up! And that means, no Irom Man films, no Captain films, No Thor films, or whatever else.

Stephano Brizzio His best stories don't involve spiderman,0.6369,8

Spiderman is the reason for his existence and, ironically, the only thing that keeps him going. They can stray from the source but breaking character like that isn't promising. It's not Venom. Another reason why its almost insulting is because since this takes place in the MCU but this venom isnt meeting spiderman, we won't get the black suit. We won't get that dynamic or interesting character development between Peter and Brock during and after the symbiotes presence. This could honestly turn out to be a very good movie and I hope its successful, but this isn't venom.",0.94,138

Yea me two I just hope they don't kill him off like 99.9% of marvel movies do to their villains,0.7606,21
Yeah but the whole reason he has powers similar to spiderman in the first place is because the symbiote binds to spiderman... so how can they do an origin story with no spiderman? Thats why a lot of comic fans are confused/irritated.,-0.296,47
"Yeah, that chance the things",0.4939,6
