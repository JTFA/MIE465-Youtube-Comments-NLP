"Surprise, surprise. These children, who have to deal with poverty and street violence, live in a city where the mayor, Tom Barrett, is a Democrat. And, the senator of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Tammy Baldwin, is also a Democrat. Why is it that major cities, where children have to deal with these kinds of issues, are always ran by Democrats. Especially when taken into consideration that Tammy Baldwin earns $79,650 as a state senator, but has a net worth of 1.3 million!!!!",-0.3438,100
