"Ashley Harps I was about to comment, but you took the words out of my mouth. I'm so glad I read your comment because I feel  the exact same way.  I'm glad I found another Justin Timberlake fan that feels the same way towards him they I do and have all these years. üëåüòÅüëè",0.9387,60

"Dude How does Zane transition so well from working every song on the album into the conversation topics. Much respect to Zane for being one of the only interviewers that focuses solely on the MUSIC! And Justin came back with another AMAZING album! He don‚Äôt switch up his producers for a reason. It‚Äôs cuz it‚Äôs worked every time!! Great theme for the album, and he always switching up his sound while still maintaining his sound, if you know what I mean!",0.9489,96

Great interview. Virtually tagged everything except for The Hard Stuff but I enjoyed the Bill Withers story and the stuff you asked about his grandfather. Can't wait to pick up this album. I looked forward to this album more than the 20/20 Experience since there were rumors about this style of album coming along from back when 20/20 was on its way. This has been years of waiting as a fan to get to this and hearing about these different cuts upped my expectations more than Filthy and Supplies ever could. I was disappointed till Say Something came out. But the cuts from behind the scenes stuff JT released made me excited because I could hear the gems that grabbed me in those few seconds and it sounds like he has a lot of standouts that weren't chosen as singles. Looking forward to dissecting it tomorrow and having this on repeat everywhere I go in my car.,0.8689,165

"I think these interviews are dope. I just think he should ask different questions or release the interview after the album drops, because, me personally, I like to experience an album without knowing much about it besides the singles.

"Thank you Zane for what you said about your thoughts on ""Say Something"". It's exactly what I thought that song stemmed from. Those kinds of moments have happened to him frequently enough over the years to where that was a simple and perfectly crafted song that really does says something without kind of pinpointing anything at all. You have to had take notice of his life to fill in the gaps there and what you said is what I would've asked him.",0.7717,88
