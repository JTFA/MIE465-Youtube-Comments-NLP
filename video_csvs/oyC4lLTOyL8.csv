People who don't have perfect pitch perception would have no idea what the other is saying...which is about  93% of the population...
Also people who are tone deaf wouldn't even have a clue what anyone is saying.
It's basically a language only 7% of the population can learn.
It's very idealistic but imagine trying to actually understand someone when you have thousands of words to choose from their speech.
It would be very useful as a sign language and it could be used by the military if they just had the radio operators be pitch perfect but most of these ""world languages"" never work because they're too simple.

I tend to dislike guest videos on this channel. Sadly it includes the past few here. I've no complaints about content, they've all been very good on that front. What I dislike is style. Different YT'ers have their own, and it makes a huge difference to me whether I'll like the video. Here there's just something about the voice that I can't stand. He speaks way too fast. He's not alone, other channels do it, and it's so annoying. It might be great for making videos fun to watch, but useless for anyone who actually wants to take in the information. Tom is brilliant at that. The one about the telescope was great in content, but something still bothered me about it.
