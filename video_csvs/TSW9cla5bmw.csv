Stephen, Daveed is in a ground breaking film about a child living with a facial difference known as Treacher Collins Syndrome which effects 1 in 50,000 babies. It is not a disease, it is a rare condition that effects the bone growth in their face resulting in major surgeries both cosmetic and functional. I know Daveed is an incredible talent to have on your show, but you could have brushed up on what and who the film is about instead of literally asking the guest if the ""boy"" has a ""disease"" and moving on to a clip that in no way was well represented. I'm bummed that the film and its goal was not discussed, the real children effected and the incredibly kind nature of these big name stars to shed light on it.

So don't be nitpicking that much it is not just about Auggie it has several different stories. Also for that clip you mentioned it wasn't suppose to represent Auggie, it was suppose to represent Mr. Brown since Daveed Plays the teacher and not Auggie , it is also the time of the movie where Mr. Brown gets most of his screen time.",0.7096,159

I said black because this guy is black.
My issue is not about the race it is more about the culture and politics , nowadays if you say the right things politically and you are on the left you can become famous and it is not right!

Suddenly now from racism towards color of the skin we have this new -ism towards your political views , and people don't even notice that is still discrimination.
And the base of the word racist is discrimination!

How can these people claim they are better when they allow freedom of color of skin but if you don't think like them you are outed.
All about diversity but don't you dare to have diversity of thought!
That is a deep hypocrisy in that thinking that corrupts their whole idea of inclusivity and diversity .


I don't even know him , but I notice on this show there are some good noticeable guests sometimes  and the rest of the time   you have the average guest who almost always is a no talent but you can see from appearance or what they talk about that they are some kind of minority , or victim or something!

This isn't about race
the same argument exists for Colbert too,  you have Colbert here he shot up to the top of late night tv by just virtue signaling , he is good but he is not that good!

He is not a good interviewer, , he is not a good stand up comedian but he has a monologue who is all about politics and TRUMP.
It is sad that that makes you successful the same with all the media and news!
Just talk about TRUMP!

Trump did one thing good, he showed the hypocrisy of the media and business in general in america .
The reason they can't defeat him is because he is part of them they can't destroy him without destroying themselves because Trump is their creation .",0.9922,347

"Yeah it’s a disease. The flu is a disease, Anxiety disorder is a disease. It has a pretty negative effect on the well being of a person with it. Even if it isn’t strictly a disease. Your comment was nit picky and completely pointless. The point of the film is pretty damn obvious. I guess he could have spewed some fun facts about it, and that would have helped somehow.",0.1531,83

"victreebel as if it doesn't hold a semblance of truth when you see YouTube bending over backwards for these late night show 'entertainers', and elsewhere striving for some 'family friendly' image while hypocritically turning a blind eye to other garbage videos who clearly break their standards because they pull in views. While at the same time they take down and demonitize the videos of actual original content creators for no reason at all. Given that this instance of bans could be chalked up to a hacking job or an irate employee, it is still not changing the issue that YouTube is making an effort to strain the life's blood of the site, and replacing it with pure bile of stupifying kids content, bland and biased late night clips, and redundant top 10s lists. I can only hope that these true content creators go to a competing site and bring their viewers with them, should YouTube continue to crash and burn at this rate.",0.4939,177
"victreebel not to mention that if one were to pay attention to YouTube's parent company Google in the news as of late, it is clear that it's CEO and board are making decisions more based on their liberal personal politics than on sound business acumen, and to not think that it would rub off on YouTube would be folley.",0.296,62
