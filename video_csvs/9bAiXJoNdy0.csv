"Listening and soundboarding is great, just be careful not to lose your own voice in the process. The more you give, the more some people take and that can leave you in a very unsatisfying cycle.

Having experienced this Tons of times, you can't carry the weight of the world and not eventually stumble from the pressure. Be the friend you want to have, advice and all.",0.7424,109

"True that, but if someone offers you advice, the wise thing to do is listen, think on it and *be grateful*

Be careful whose advice you buy, but *BE PATIENT* with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.
