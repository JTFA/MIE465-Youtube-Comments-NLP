JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

"Hello guys,
i'm autistic myself.

Autistic or other ""disabled"" people should be played by autistic or ""disabled"" people! Not by neurotypicals. It's just insulting and patronizing if autistic people are played by neurotypicals. Even if a ""name"" means funding. Movie companies have collected hundred when not even trillions of Dollars, plus attention and compliments with obviously autistic characters or characters with autistic traits. Same is for other ""disabled"" people. It's time that the so called disabled themselves are getting included!

It's good that there are more and more TV-shows and movies with ""disabled"" persons, because with that, Neurotypicals can familiarize with (fictional) autists or other ""disabled persons"" and some kind of their behaviour, which will spread awareness for them. But: The ""disabled"" themselves are still excluded.

Don't play me pay me! And also have a nice day. ;)

"I love to see people just come here to say "" why is it on trending with random # views"". It is a good trailer and looks like a good movie. 
Also it could be on website and currently driving traffic not picked up by the view counter yet. It could be placed here by Youtube because they was paid. A algorithm could of put it here for some unknown reason or a employee who likes Dakota Fanning could of placed it here for no reason other then they like her. 

Who cares how it is here just enjoy the trailer or move on. But everyone knows videos get put on trending with low views all the time and there is no reason or explanation to why yet they still have to ask as if someone is going to answer.
