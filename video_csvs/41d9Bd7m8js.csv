I didn't see his character making her laugh often. She would always be with a neutral expression on her face. At least I can cope by saying that I have something his character does not have: make my girlfriend laugh all the time. 

My question is, can you women be with a man that has all those things: GOOD LOOKING, MONEY, SEX, and NEVER MAKE YOU LAUGH?

"I don’t understand the amount of negative comments, with all the respect all of you deserve I personally think it’s a good movie. It’s not all about sex, it has actually a story line that follows how Christian Grey got abused and still learned how to love Anastasia the way she wanted him to. It’s more than sadomasochistic sex, it also talks about how Christian likes to control women during sexual relationships to feel pleasured but that changes when he meets Anastasia. He didn’t only fall in love with her but show her how much he loves her. 

Now, I don’t think he is ashamed of the movie, I mean... he knows what he signed for. Of course he cannot talk about it freely because there’s a sensitive audience. Also, guys remember he is married...!! Of course it’s not easy for him to talk about it without being hesitant of saying stuff that might cause people to have a different point of view of the movie. 

Anyways, that’s just my opinion and if any of you are going to insult me or criticize me just don’t reply to this. Don’t waste your time hating someone that you won’t even meet.",-0.4182,244

"Isa Tzuyu Stan 
 Hi lm so so glad you understand the movie I guess a lot of them were more interested in sex than the story.  I don't know who ever
classified it as PORN because it's PORN. Right from the beginning I thought it was a beautiful LOVE STORY. Tome it was about 2 people who didn't know the first thing about love 
Anna was raised by her step
father he did the best he could but a girl  reds her mom. Anna's mother wasn't bad but she was consumed with making it all about herself she
just kept marrying over and
over she could never taught Anna what true love was. Then
there was poor Christian who's
mom was an addict and I guess a prostitute and the men beat her and tortured Christian but even when adopted he got mixed up with 
Someone who could ruined him for life. To the meeting of Anna and Christian was the best thing that ever could happen to them because 
Christian learned how to love and trust and Anna learned how to love and she taught 
Christian she also became the stronger of the two. Finally 
They became one. It is truly a 
Beautiful Beautiful love story. 
    The CONNECTION and the
CHEMISTRY between Jamie 
And Dakota made everyWORD

Fifty Shades trilogy is about Christian overcoming his past and how he learn how to love someone (Ana) unconditionally, and how he went from someone who doesn't know how to do romance (which he see himself as) to someone who can. Ana is his light that helped Christian changed and that's a touching love story imo! People who hates this series and see this as Porn is someone I see that doesn't understand this story at all... in the overall you wrote a good summary to this series and why we as fans love it not for the sex or the bdsm side of things but the romance side on how the characters grown and become better characters in the end.
