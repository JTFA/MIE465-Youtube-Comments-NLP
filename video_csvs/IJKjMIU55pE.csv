"+Steven Bulfer Agreed. I think what they might have inadvertently gotten right is that once a ""real"" self-aware ""artificial"" intelligence comes around it may be very unlike human intelligence. What we so hautilly refer to as our consciousness is an emergent property that is based a _lot_ on other functions of the body, like how it responds to things like bursts of adrenaline, serotonin, and other little chemical cocktails along with stimuli that our brain interprets as pain and pleasure. Over time, AI will develop its own versions of things that _might_ be analogous to those things but will indeed be very different. Oh, we may try to overlay our own emotions over them, but in the end we may find it very hard to relate to one another. What is pain to a machine? Love? Hunger? Will we build feedback systems into machines or will they emerge on their own. Maybe it will be a combination of both? In the beginning, it might be something like when Data (in Star Trek: The Next Generation) said to someone when they were leaving for a long time, or permanently, as in death, they will be missed. Please excuse my nerdiness, but this clip might help explain what I'm getting at: ""Data defines friendship"" https://youtu.be/qcqIYccgUdM.

A while ago, I postulated that new general A.I.s might eventually be put through a simulation where, without realizing that they are actually machines, they will be put through a series of tests in which they will experience life as a human along with all of the shortcomings, advantages, triumphs and failures that go along with it. Then, they will learn such things like what a chair is really for. ;) It may just be that the only way a machine will be able to truly be sentient is to go through such a process in order to ""awaken"" what we call consciousness. But, again, it will likely be very much an emergent property that in the end we may still know nothing about how it really works. We won't be able to look at a chunk of the programming code and actually ""see"" what we call love, hate, or any other number of emotions that actually ""mean"" something and which it _really_ understands rather than just spitting out a response. That, or we will learn some very disturbing things about ourselves concerning what we think of as ""free"" will. All I know is...time will tell... ;) I hope I live long enough to see the beginning of it all. :) In the meantime, it's fun to postulate how it will all come together... ;)

Even if that doesn’t happen, an AGI is automatically vastly superior than human beings in multiple areas because it can utilise existing Narrow AI in ways that humans can’t. So if an AGI genuinely wants to do something, it will be extremely difficult for humans to stop it unless literally perfect safety measures were implemented in its programming. And it is also very difficult to get an AGI to do want you want it to do. Human values are complex, and if we design an AGI that isn’t exactly inline with our values, it is an AGI that we don’t want to build. We only have one shot at doing this, and if we make a mistake, it will likely come back to bite us very quickly.",0.9572,179

"How confident they all appear about the prospects of AI and its limitations - meanwhile AI projects e.g at Facebook had to be shut down, since it had started to talk to itself in its own language. Now add to the fact the Military Research is nearly always about 10-30 years ahead than what is offered on the consumer market.

The nearly only reason we keep going forward at such strong pace with the AI is because it holds the prospect of answering questions that we can not yet solve. A Mega AI Computer connected to the entire internet will be able to render answers and solutions over a few weeks to months that would take a whole intellectual group at a university up to 20 years to cover. Those who uncover new territory will off course have huge advantages over their competitors and rule e.g. the market or the section of the market.

It is frankly scary to see how highly naive some researchers are on this field and in particular on the university level - Seen various professors talk about IA and interaction with humans and the ethical aspects that should shell the AI - meanwhile Darpa and others are developing Military AI´s - The prospect of access to enough data and having enough calculating power would make it highly possible that an AI would create something that mimics a neural network, which then could spur a kind of self awareness - In the moment something like this happens, then the gates are wide open for unknown happenings. The worst scenario apart from an AI taking over Robots, would be a manipulating scenario - in fact that would be far far more dangerous prospect of self aware AI than anything else. Coming up next is Bio chips, they will be far superior in processing power which means quite a lot to the overall processing abilities.

This video appears like there is absolutely nothing to fear or worry about from AI development, not even the loss of Jobs - Which is frankly an understatement unless the governments would start reeducating the workforces.

AI´s are already beating the best gamers in the world from GO to Dotta - Anybody thinking there is absolutely nothing to be concerned about with the current development of AI are simply being naive or they might be straight up lying.",0.9589,420

"They not like humans...yet...
I think the reason that they aren't like humans is that they aren't exposed to as much data as we are. We are constantly bombarded with data since the moment we are born. We have 5 senses that can't be turned off(kind of) our brains are constantly running, nonstop, not even while we're asleep. a robot that can tell two kinds of pictures apart is ONLY exposed to those kinds of pictures, no videos, no audio, no sense of touch, no taste.",-0.8617,102

We're different, and hopefully done right, we can arguably have cures to diseases and solutions to really hard problems with the help of AI. But we don't have to always reinforce with futility how awesome humans are (we are), in a fearful way that tells people what they want to hear (human good, AI far from human level) instead of the truth.",0.9438,172

"interesting vid :D
07:00 the issue is properly that ""common sense"" is absolutely not the same for everyone, we can't even agree if it is wrong to rape a person who is outcold, the ""common sense"" is Not common or sense for the majority of people. it depends on culture, personal education lvl, personal limits, personal morals, etc.
it is almost as random as every other random setup: which is why you can't train a computer to do it.

it's the same with morale, its not a defined stated which most humans agree on but completely fractured with millions of different views on what is morally correct and what is wrong, which all depends on the random factor above ""common sense"" which again depends on the random factor of ""proper raising a child"" which again depends on ""social status, and education lvl"".

all these terms which is said that a computer can't really do is the same that humans ""can't really do"" we simply randomly apply our own view of what it is to it; and so can a computer. 
as there is no ""correct answer"" the computer obviously can't come to a point where it can give the ""correct answer"" as it doesn't exist, it is so far from existing that it's the same as asking it to figure out if it is a banana or a human in a world where the data says it's random when human attributes are bananas and the other way around.

this is a human issue not a computer or AI issue imho. (and given enough ""correct data"" a computer will be FAR better at making judgement calls which are correct, given the dataset is correct; which it won't be as even within the same person our judgement will change with time and can even change within the same day, hour or minute, depending on mood, effect of environment, etc.
countries entire legal system is build up around changing people's minds by manipulating them with different input which change their mindset and opinions constantly..)

in short the computer is not what misses the mark, the human is as we got no clear moral, common sense, intelligent way of doing stuff, curiosity, abstract thinking etc etc. it is all very random when looking at humans as a whole.",-0.1642,438
