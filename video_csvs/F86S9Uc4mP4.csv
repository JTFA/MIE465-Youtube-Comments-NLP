"I've never had any other beverage at McDonald's, other than their orange drink (what is was called in NY when I was a kid). It was never called Hi-C until years later. Though it was always assumed. Even though I have my doubts. It never tasted like the glass bottle of Hi-C we got at the grocery store. McDonald's was always better. Though it could have been just in my head.

In any case, I used to eat McDonald's at least once a week. However, I haven't spent a dime there since they got rid of it, and I won't, unless they bring it back. Sadly my personal boycott won't make a bit of difference, but it makes me feel better.

There was no reason to get rid of a popular beverage at all, let alone in place of some idiotic concoction. They could have just added the new drink. Instead, some arrogant moron decided to drop a staple, and that moron is way to arrogant to admit they were wrong.",-0.9821,195
