"At 3:54 you can see how this saw is formed. There's a straight edge to fit into the groove and the teeth of the saw blade doesn't cover the whole length. It only covers the middle portion of the blade. So you slide the straight edge in, then begin to saw and the teeth are at 90 degrees and cut ""sideways"" to the straight edge. I've never seen that before - very cool.",0.7713,81

Two or three strokes of the saw and he's exactly to the line - not approximately,   EXACTLY to the line.     No need for bevel gauges or dovetail marking gauges - just an experienced eye and sheer skill and the angles are all exactly right.       I know if i tried that i wouldn't just need a bigger hammer.  I'd need a sledgehammer.       I'm going to start practicing.      Come find me again in 10 years,  I'll let you know if i've made a dovetail joint yet.",0.7724,118

"The saws themselves are frame saws which you should make yourself, Paul sellers has a free video guide on how to make one. The blades can be obtained from speciality stores like fine-tools.com, but you can also buy bandsaw blades from good hardware stores.",0.775,48
"The way he made the horizontal cuts puzzled me. I thought he was using a bow saw 
with a 1/4"" blade, known as a ""Schweifsaege"" in Germany. Essentially a 60cm coping saw. 
I tried it with mine and the blade cheerfully continued to cut straight ahead, nix on 90°. So I asked a German master cabinet maker who also teaches woodworking - including an
excellent course on dovetailing -  to take a look. He pointed out that Frank Klausz is using a 
special blade in his saw. The blade is known as a ""Zinkensaegeblatt (= dovetail blade)"" or 
""Winkelsaegeblatt ( = angle blade)"". The first third of the blade has no teeth. After the first third the blade turns 90°. So you put it in vertically, push and suddenly you are cutting horizontally. 
Obviously the vertical cut has to be wide enough to accommodate the blade, so these were 
done using a normal bow saw. A kerf on a Japanese saw is too thin for the final cut.  If you 
look at the video and freeze it at 4:00 you can get a good look at the blade. 

It's a brilliant idea, but it was primarily used for dovetails on door jambs and window frames 
where the joints are not visible. Because the cuts are so rough - the wood tears on the rear - 
normally you would never use it for cabinet work or boxes. Frank Klausz and probably 40 years 
of experience show the exception to the rule. 

My cabinet maker friend mentioned dovetailing was commonly done in Germany for doors  
and windows. Within ten minutes three guys could cut, assemble and set a door jamb using 
dovetails. He also said, as far as he knows, the blades are no longer being made. I researched 
the tool sites in Germany and could not find them anywhere, but that of course does not mean 
they are not available. I just haven't found them.  I definitely want one of those things, so my 
best bet will be a flea-market or similar.

For any interested souls out there, a good illustration of the blade can be found at:  

http://www.woodworking.de/cgi-bin/forum/webbbs_config.pl/md/read/id/2865

or Google on ""Zinkensaegeblatt"" or ""Winkelsaege"". Ignore the German and enjoy the
