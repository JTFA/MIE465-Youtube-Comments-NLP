"Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
(It's been a long time coming)
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home

Look, I've been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone


Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home

Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home
Home, home

Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witness, after all of these decision
So these miles, feets, inches, they can’t add them to the distance

A place where even if there’s no closure, I’m still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody gives me a sign I’m starting to lose fate

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me how did all my dreams turn into nightmares
How did I lose it, when I was right there
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I’m tryna fight

Look, I’ve been through so much pain
And it’s hard to maintain
This smile on my face, cuz this madness is on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain’t on a map
Gotta follow other feelings to discover where it’s at
I need the (memories)
In case this fate is forever, just make sure these last days are better
And if I’m dead (enemies)
Then give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make him homesick
