"I see a lot of hate from people who don’t understand why you would wait a year to name your baby. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that- it gives you time to pick a name that fits your child. What I DON’T understand is that you had an entire year to talk about it and make a decision, and you turned up at the naming office without knowing what her name was going to be, and not knowing how to spell it!! 🙄",-0.8118,100
I think it’s beautiful that she can look back on this day in the future and see how much love and thought went into her name.,0.8442,29
I think that’s cool that you waited to find out what suits her.,0.3182,16
I would like to have full understandings on why they wait til the child is one to name .like is it a traditional thing?? .I mean I don't see anything  wrong despite you have a whole nine months to figured out a child name while the baby in the womb .so going through the process of being pregnant and then waiting to child turn one ... just wanted to know in what way is that beneficial or is that a traditional thing people do . Because honestly a child is already become aware of there surrounding and become creative and have ideas at ~ Even before that age it would make sense if the child knew there name early that's just my opinion but people make the decision best for their child ..so if the child happy and parents happy that's all that matters,0.979,150
"I'm not criticizing, I am actually curious about this because I was unaware you could do something like this. Could someone explain what this means?",0.6261,28
I'm so glad you chose to spell it as Ajoui,0.5095,10
I'm so happy for baby Ajoui 💕💕💕💕 Young one so adorable hahaha,0.9184,14
"I've been looking for a video, but can't seem to find it, where you two discuss this. So may i ask the purpose behind waiting a year? Was there something to it, or did you two just want to make sure you chose the right name that truly suited your child? I'm curious about it, and don't mean any sort of insult or anything. Just genuinely curious. We tend to name children before we even see them or know them, and I've thought about it before how what if I feel like the name no longer suits that child and their personality? So I'm definitely not judging in any way. Just interested.",0.9499,125
"Im glad you chose the U, it looks more authentic. She is sooo adorable. Congratulations to her and well done parents 👏👏👏👏",0.9042,27

It is disrespectful to your child to wait that long. Nine months is not long enough!? Come ON that is bullshit!!!,-0.7156,27
It would have been nice to have an African and a Korean name.,0.4215,14
"It's so crazy that me and my child's father wanted to do this & everybody was so worried (which was super annoying). We decided on a name before baby was born but it was literally like a month before & only because the name literally came to me in my sleep and dad added his spin. If I ever do it again, I think I will wait!",0.496,73
I’m so happy the baby has a name!❤️❤️❤️❤️,0.6468,19
I’m so jealous I don’t have a unique name! Ajoui is a beautiful! My mom said she didn’t give me a unique name because she didn’t want me to have to deal with people pronouncing it wrong my whole life. There’s definitely pros and cons!,0.3363,59
