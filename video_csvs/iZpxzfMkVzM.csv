The passion in this chef (and also all of the workers there) is so prominent. Hats off to them! The feel of this video is so relaxing, how you filmed, how the chef and the okama talks, the ambiance of the nature, and the progression of the video itself, just amazing.

"A view that only exists in Kyoto. Now that is something I must add to my to-do (or should I say to-go) list. I can't stop admiring all the fauna sprouting in every corner of this video along with the gentle chimes of the Mushishi like music in the background, everything is so enchanting and perfect, the food looks like they were prepared with delicate hands, even the people working there seemed so graceful. I'm definitely captivated by the old traditions of Nippon and wish this secret world existed in ours.

All the wisdom and life philosophies shared by everyone who works there also made me rethink some things in my life. I may sound cheesy and cliche (also due to the fact that english is not my native language, so I'm sorry about that), but that's really how I felt. Thank you for making videos like this.

"This is a beautiful place.  Lovely but I have one problem.  We traveled all over the world when I was young.  My Father was in construction overseas and when he went, we went.  Japan is a great place.  A very clean country but I have trouble eating any thing raw.  Especially fish or any kind of meat.  Our Mother told us we'd get worms if we ate raw anything.  We never got anything so I took her at her word.  It's why I can't eat at places like this.  And no offense to the American lady but your tats bother me.  Reminds me of the Yakuza.  You are the first woman I've seen shave your head.  Your business but it bothers me as an American.  I use to tell my students if you have a poster in your room, in ten years you'll probably want to take it down.  Tats are like that don't you think?  I guess I do sound mean but I don't get why people do that to their bodies.  It's great you respect other cultures.   Songsmirth",0.948,200
"This is a high quality documentary with beautiful cinematography and editing that I'm sure took a lot of work, and you should be very proud of the outcome.
However, personally, as a foodie and food reviewer, I couldn't help but be frustrated at the lack of discussion of the food - if not a full review, at least a brief explanation of the flavours/components of each dish. I understand that would be tricky to incorporate into this style of film, and may have ruined the flow, and I can appreciate your focus on the atmosphere and service as key parts of the experience. Nonetheless, as a restaurant the food is a crucial aspect of the whole experience, and I feel this part was neglected.
I hope you can try to find a way to include a description of the food while maintaining the style of these productions, and I look forward to watching your work in the future.",-0.7982,175

"This is so beautiful, and I still found myself tensing up watching it. I think because it's a luxury place, and I bet a lot of lower income Japanese people would also feel a bit uncomfortable going to a place like this even if someone else was paying for it, because it's the age old worry of low class people in high class surroundings. You always feel like you don't know how to be polite in this situation, like you would almost be more comfortable being the one doing the serving.",0.7202,98

"This restaurant demonstrates the many aspects of the Japanese culture which set it apart from most of the world.  The fanatical attention to detail, deep contemplation about the ingredients and the preparation process to maximize the individual flavors and overall taste. And the presentation, it's a work of art.  I'm Korean born and chuckle at how Korean cuisine experience is essentially the exact opposite of the Japanese, that is to say that Korean food has several dominating ingredients and flavors:  garlic, chili paste, sesame oil which coat vegetables, meats and fish.  And the Korean dining table is a total mess, like post-typhoon.  But Korean food is in my blood and I will always need to eat it, and when I need a zen culinary experience, I'll go to a good Japanese restaurant.",0.5267,148

"What I found most interesting is the fact that Martina is tattooed, visibly flaunts them and was allowed into the restaurant.  Tattoos are a sign of barbarians and specifically mobsters.  Some hot springs ban people with tattoos because they will make the other bathers nervous (people go full Monty in Japan, no bathing suits). Something will have to be done in advance of the 2020 Olympics--tourist education, changes in policy--to avoid conflicts and embarrassment.

Kyoto was the former capital of Japan and is still very traditional and elite, as evidenced in the video by the etiquette of entry to the restaurant and manner of serving guests.  You can't get into some establishments such a traditional geisha tea house without a reference or formal introduction.  Kyotoites speak a refined and coded type Japanese which confuses outsiders, e.g. ""Would you like more tea...?"" means ""It's getting late (time for you to go)..."" 
 
Still, this is a great video, visually exciting and very informative.",-0.4779,189

Where is the 'love' button? The way they spoke of the food and area was beautiful. Fantastically filmed too. Kyoto is definitely on my hope to visit one day list. I would have cried with happiness had I been there in person.,0.8885,49
Whoa... I don't know why but this place had me in tears. It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen. That sort of attentiveness can't be found in America anywhere.,0.664,34

Wow I honestly didn't expect a reply you guys are amazing! You're so positive and I can really learn from that. You have a point I can see that now. Thanks for the reply!,0.9582,38
"Wow so many things to respond to! Hahah. First off, I'm Canadian, not American. I know, all us white people look alike and it is super confusing so it's probably best not to just assume that every plain old English accent = they're from the USA. You're welcome to just ask next time, then you could find out where that person is from without assuming. :) ¬†Secondly, this isn't true for everyone with a tattoo, but my tattoos have a very personal and uplifting meaning. I designed it, thought about it for years, and now I've had them for years, so no, I don't want to ""take them down"" like some fleeting teenage fad for a horses. It might be surprising to you, but tattoos can be filled with deep meaning and their permanence is a constant uplifting reminder. ¬†And finally, your mother is just plain wrong about raw food...but I'd recommend not eating raw fish from a lake.",0.7808,184

"the most *expensive restaurant in Japan ... :( 
I like some of these videos but at the same time, we ain't gonna go there. who has like 1200$ for two people meal, without counting the travel ? I believe not your viewers... The video is very well made, but it's very unattainable and therefore I can't really enjoy the video as much.
I am all for good and high end restaurants, but a lot are extremely good and are a great experience, without setting you back the price of the actual flight to Japan for one meal. Some molecular restaurant or the french restaurant in the Mandarin Oriental, for example ! I'll be waiting for a new video of a place I can actually hope to go :)",0.9773,140
