"Do you mean Tig?  I thought she was funny!  I used the timestamps someone provided and went directly to her segment and then watched Nina Turner.  People can't be serious all the time.  We need to laugh.  *I* need to laugh b/c I just don't have the faith, hope, or love that Nina was talking about.  If that's all this was, I'd just feel shitty listening to this.  I was bored with the music at the beginning.   If I was sharing this, I'd send someone a link that skips over that and goes directly to the speakers.  Or were you talking about another comedian besides Tig?  If so, I'd like to hear the person to understand better what you are saying.  I didn't hear Tig saying, ""like,"" every few words, so maybe it was someone else of whom you are speaking.",0.9687,167
"Gates & Buffett have already given away most of their money.  They are generous, unlike the greedy Cock brothers.  I'm frustrated too.  The Left spends their money trying to make the world better while the Right spends their money getting and keeping power and using that power to get more power and to take power away from their political opposition.  IDK why Dem leaders and wealthy progressives don't see that!",0.1429,76
I found out that they trimmed the dead time off the beginning of the vid.  She now comes in @ 2:07:51,-0.6486,24
"I really love the movement.... I love Jennifer Lawrence.... and I like Bernie Sanders.... but I could have done without the religious undertones in this. 
Also, if you are going to have solidarity and speak for all races and parties, don't make it a racial thing ""giving a shout out to black history month"" etc.
I am an agnostic-athiest, non-partisan, anti-rasist humanist HUMAN.   If you want to make a point, show intelligence and do so, don't throw all the rest of the BS in there with it.",0.9652,102
"I was going to share this BUT! The comedian ruined the whole idea that this was worth sharing... It was like, way to like, uncalled for and like, had no impact on like, helping me to want like, stand up and like, put up with like, more of that trash. I was so like, WHY?????",0.9833,69
"Jennifer Lawrence is really talented and I am proud of her, bc she is brave for speak about these issues. Some people who don´t think the same as Represent us are atacking jen just for her opinions. I really feel bad for it",0.7442,48

No. It was the very first one Nickie. She was NOT funny. At all.,0.1779,18
"Were there 3 comics?  I might still have missed the ""very first"" one.  The one I watched was the blonde woman who performed just before the astronaut spoke.",-0.296,33
"When I click on that Timestamp, it takes me to Nina Turner in the middle of her speech.  IDK how the Timestamps got so out of sync, but that link takes me way past the end of Tig's segment; not even close to the beginning.",-0.1447,50
"ahh i somehow missed that this was happening. represent.us is awesome, finding some way to nullify the Citizens United decision is the single thing that anybody can push for politically that would affect the most positive change. until we do this, every other fight is a losing battle against unlimited corporate campaign contributions and all the corruption that goes with it. i just SEVEN YEARS of Citizens United we've already seen shit like Comcast/Verizon getting one of their own to run the FCC and just hand over the backbone of the internet to them, a publicly-owned commodity that is worth easily billions of dollars, possibly trillions in the broadest sense. things will get worse on every front until we deal with the root issue of much if not most of the dysfunction in our political system, and this is the root cause. i firmly believe giving a dollar or spending an hour on this issue is the equivalent of giving thousands of dollars and years of time to various other issues",0.8238,183
