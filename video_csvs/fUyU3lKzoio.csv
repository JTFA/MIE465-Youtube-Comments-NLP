"+Chad Man It takes millions of dollars to develop these robots, and at most they could make about 5 dollars per thousand views or thereabouts with these videos, judging off of what Youtubers have said about video monetization, which would put it at 5 grand made for every million. That's not even enough to pay one programmer's monthly salary, much less their health insurance and paid leave. Sure, that's only for one million views, and their videos get a lot more than that on average, so I'll add it up. In the past year, Boston Dynamics has put up 5 videos, totaling 47 million views. So even with the most optimistic figure of around 5 dollars per thousand views that's only 235,000 dollars US. The engineers and programmers working in these fields have *starting* salaries upwards of 70 grand a year, and you can bet that many people who work on these robots aren't just starting out. But I'm going to give your theory the absolute best shot, so let's divide 235 by 70 to get the amount of people who could work there given the budgets of these videos, and we get 3.36, and we have to round down, as you can't have more people working there than they have the money for, so that puts the count at three. Not only is that not nearly enough to run a company like Boston Dynamics, hell it's barely enough to run a convenience store, but you can see more than three people at the company if you just watch the videos they've put out over the past year. Keep in mind that I've only been mentioning salary costs for the employees, I didn't even mention paying utilities, licensing software, paying rent for the huge facility they operate out of, etc.

Finally, Boston Dynamics doesn't need to entice investor interests with fake cgi videos of robots they haven't finished yet, as investors are already interested in them and know about them. Keep in mind this is a company which has won multiple DARPA contracts. They have the attention of the relevant people already, and it makes much more sense for them to just develop the robots first and then show them off instead of showing fake robots in hopes that they can make the real ones fast enough to satisfy the people interested in using them. If Google dropped Boston Dynamics, it's because Google is the one having financial trouble, not the other way around.",0.9737,456
