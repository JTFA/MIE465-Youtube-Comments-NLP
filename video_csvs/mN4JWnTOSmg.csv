I, 'AGREE'. Nicole Murphy is alright, but I think a MORE 'PRETTIER' woman SHOULD have been in the video that would have CAUGHT Drake's ATTENTION, in my opinion. 💯💯

Did perhaps, someone OWED Nicole Murphy a 'FAVOR' and put her in this commercial??!! 🤷🤷
😲😲

The ONLY thing ON POINT, was Murphy's dress. 💯💯👏👏Because, though Nicole Murphy likes to wear her hair short, her 'TOO SHORT' hair style WASN'T gettin' it, and Nicole had on waaaay TOO MUCH mascara TOO!! She just DIDN'T show that 'Sexy' quality to me. 💯💯🖓🖓",0.9251,143
