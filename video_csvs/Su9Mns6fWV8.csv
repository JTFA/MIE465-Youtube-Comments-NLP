"Lyrics :


In Atlanta, Georgia there's a deadly virus makin' Zombies
And the few survivors who have found each other get to bonding
In communities, regain humanity, try not to give up
Living peaceful lives

But when this group arrives, it all goes tits up
Pick a destination
You can bet that they will burn it all down
CDC, The farm, The prison, Terminus, Woodbury, and now

Alexandria and probably other buildings in a new town
Even though the universal threat is Zombies and they're scary
If you're still alive and dwell in Southern areas, be wary
That this group of people

Though they may seem cool and well-intentioned
They will guarantee destruction of your haven with their presence
Think of Hershel's family
They were coping well 'til Rick's group showed up

Folks in Alexandria were doing fine 'til Rick's group showed up
Zombies do less damage on the living
Than when Rick's group shows up
And by the way, i call the Zombies what they are

Not Walkers, Biters, Geeks, Lamebrains, Skin-Eaters, Creepers
Have these people seen a horror film at all
Getting back on track
It's really effing crazy how this one group

Can be so destructive while so many people can avoid it
Every single building in the southern U.S. not on fire
Really is a building Rick and Co have not yet set on fire
It make sense in cases like the homes of cannibals and psychos

They were cleary evil, but i can't help noticing a pattern
If i were to have a dinner party and they asked for invites
I'd be like ""No way in hell because i'd rather my apartement
To be not on fire, thank you go away, now take a shower""

Then my party would have
Guests who pose no threat of stencch or arson
Those are things i've noticed
In the Walking Dead, now i'll be going

That is all i came to say
