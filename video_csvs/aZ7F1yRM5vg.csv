"I think the gorilla's were confused.  I think they perceived it like a break in between the trees.  They could see another Gorilla, but it wasn't there, and BEHIND it They kept touching the mirrors back to see how it is that another gorilla can exist to reach up behind them.  The image of them ALWAYS stairs BACK.  But I don't think they understand.  The one behind the bush is worried maybe about it.  They might recognize that it is them, but their autonomous thinking is much slower than a humans.  YOU and I or any human will be like thats a mirror right?  And if we NEVER see it we would move around to watch ourselves look at it.  Then we would figure OUT we see what is around inside the mirror because you CAN see stuff around you.  But the Gorilla's autonomous thinking is slower.  But this demonstrates that Gorillas as painted in movies as adulterous monsters that are violent are wrong.  Gorillas have a inquisitive nature.  They are interested in how things work around them, but lack what humans have.  Real time thinking.  But the video makers are quite right.  To what level they can understand the mirror will take time.  If we can understand how their minds work better, and DNA science could solve the issue of how their brainwaves process information AND WHY to relation, and if we could modify this, humans could possibly produce a sentient gorilla embro and implant and impregnate a female gorilla to make a sentient one.  This creates legal issues however, in NOT doing the experiment itself, but their-after.  The mother is CONSIDERED a lower life-form, but the baby once discovered if the experiment is successful despite NOT being human would HAVE to have our rights placed upon the new evolved homo-sapiens.  But monitoring may be wise because remember humans are students and we can get things wrong.  So as parents of such a creation continued research would be our responsibility.  But welfare laws would HAVE to make it so the researchers preserve its right to live.  Besides, what would be the benefit of killing a unique species?  However, it would then become necessary to create more and now we would be sharing the planet with another fully evolved being.  Would the evolved creature be able to learn to talk like us and walk upright?  Interesting idea.  But I think this man discovered the basis that higher thinking if slower exists in that species of Gorilla in my opinion.  The basis of the event was that the gorillas don't all agree with another.  One sought to understand the mirror.  Another was afraid of the mirror or seemed to be.  But rest assured, the DNA instructions for the Gorilla are probably as complex as that of human but different so achieving the goal is far for it.  An list of goals MUST be achieved.  First, you must understand their brain and how it works and presently our system for identifying is inappropriate as it requires a willing individual to lie down while such scans are taken and I don't want to be their if the Gorilla is upset by the process.  I'm going to PASS on the experience of a Gorillas reaction to a medical scan.  Several peaces of the Gorillas anatomy would have to be obtained.  The process between birth to adult hood of the gorillas so you can Differ the instructions in the handling process.  We are still trying to understand humans much less although we been at it for a large number of years.  The earliest happening do to experiments we prefer not to conduct today.  Only then were we certain of the internal function of the guerrilla can you begin to guess it.  Expanding to checking the growth rate of the gorillas within the womb of a female guerrilla would be a step necessary.  Only then probably in 20 or 30 years could we guess whether or NOT it would be possible.  I am sure they have learned some for surgical repair, but more is needed of course.  For all of human DNA research were still at it.  There are consequences which at this time, the new species requires there own right to choose and we don't have room for another higher life-form building houses of its choice currently.  The structure of a guerrilla is certainly different, therefor they would want a lifestyle to fit them.  Their hands as it are are currently overlarge than a human so if one of those gorillas wished to operate a car my guess is that our drivers wheels would NOT be correct.  Second, they have a bulkier form and the space of the auto and reaching distance is different.  See my point?  Third, we can instruct them in the beginning, but differences between our two species would pop up, on an higher thinking level they may and likely would process information very differently.  consequently issues could pop up which is another.  But at the very least more experiments to see how the guerrillas current information processing rate could and certainly would be wise.  The ones in the wild would be more efficient than caged ones.  The ones in a cage develop a human dependency so therefor they respond differently to contact and dependency lessons the effect possibly of their abilities.  The ones in the wild have to EXIST on their-own even if it is on a basic level.  This probably and may produce the effect where they have to figure things out.  So I have to agree with this mans idea to see the reaction to the tame and the ones in the wild.  It sounds silly, a man taking a trip with a mirror for this goal, but its actually genius.  The baby ones seem to play to learn, but the parent cut that off to take them away.  That is an example of inter parental care.  Its almost as if the mirror was outside of its understanding and it wanted NOTHING to do with that.  That is another thing that slows them down,  for them a new project something that they NEVER done before isn't fun.  But, for humans it is.  For instance the man wanted to journey to understand their reaction, the aging gorilla wanted NOTHING for its young to do with it so playtime learning ended.  Does this behavior just go away as they get older?  See that represents a change in aged linear thinking.  How much differently does the youth one for brain activity to an aged gorilla for this species?  Present research shows they may have done research, but this man has demonstrated even in monitoring their are holes.  However we cannot be sure that the aged gorrilla had NO interest.  It may have deemed that perception of safety only.  which demonstrates singular thinking rather than group thinking.  The EXAMPLE of group thinking is in this text.  Many humans don't use group thinking.  the ability to bounce back and forth between thought and subject.  But I considered several different ideas of thought in exploring this video at once, and sometimes flipping back and forth it writing this statement.  The Gorilla's may lack the ability of GROUP thinking.  Maybe not entirely.  But trial and error develops it.  If it exists, it wont exist in the ones in the habitat.  It will be the wild ones to observe this naturally.  The ability if it CAN exist if the species can do it if it isn't explored by the species.  Its like this, we have the ability to choose to try to learn to read as a kid.  Well, the gorillas CAN possibly have this ABILITY but have not discovered it.  Also if their vocals are different if they can learn to talk it might NEVER be like a humans.  Another words....trying to teach a guerrilla speech even if the thinking is at our level is impossible if they do possess vocals.  so shared speech might be beyond us even if their minds evolved.  But, some of the ability might exist inside them.  They just might not be exploring it FULLY maybe.  Maybe by reading this you will think group thinking is bad, but the thing is that my information response is being represented by existing information of our technology, what I do know of a large number, and the idea of sciences on a being we don't know a ton about.  This is why some parts cast doubt on other parts. Conjecture helps to come up with possibilities, but other part can disprove another part.  I have not solely eliminated other parts as remember their are holes in the understanding process which includes the Gorilla's mental functionality.  But my view is on my understanding of subjects A and B for this video.  The man and general premise of human understanding and comparative guestiment of subject B and C.  Parent and the young.  I would be most interested in how a group of adult gorillas perceive the mirror if this man would return to the forest again.  I specifically am interested in ones NOT in charge of young.  The idea is the differences in comparison because they may perceive it differently.  I would suggest running it on a few others too to see if the adult reaction is different, then do it a couple more times with parents with a charge to see if you ALWAYS get the same reaction to the mirror and their own images.  But this man came up with it, only he should have the right to finish.  Also, I don't live in an location where this environment DOES NOT exist.  But comparitive study requires group data of whatever and thats where we are lacking.  This man ran 1 experiment.",0.998,1772

In my opinion It‚Äôs not a question of self recognition of course they recognize it‚Äôs them. They have seen their reflection many times in water seems kind of obvious and also I think they would respond differently if they thought the gorilla in the mirror was different than themselves so the only logical explanation is they have seen and are familiar with their reflections.
