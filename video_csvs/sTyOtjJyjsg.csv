"I can give you some answers, I am not an Apple technician or designer, but I am plenty knowledgeable when it comes to electronics:

Those ""batteries"" are actually capacitors; electronic components that provide temporary storage of electricity and are used to filter out power fluctuations and distortions in the audio signals.

The bottom most board with the ""batteries"" is the power supply board.

The ring board below the subwoofer is most likely what contains the microphones and sound sensors

The top panel most likely contains the ""brains"" and the capacitive interface (black glossy circle with Siri animation) on top.

You are correct in calling the speakers at the very bottom tweeters; high-frequency speakers

I cannot fault you for not having this knowledge, but I hope that I may have helped you to learn a little more about electronics, or at least the construction and inner workings of the HomePod. Otherwise, a great video! The first deep dive into the HomePod.",0.9522,182
