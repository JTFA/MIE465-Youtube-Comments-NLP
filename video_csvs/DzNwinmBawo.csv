1. the comment?
2. the video on your channel where the comment was made? 
3. the google+ profile associated with the comment? 

I would like to know this important information. Unless I'm mistaken, it seems they did NOTHING WHATSOEVER with the information you gave them, other than take a copy of the screenshot and then run a half-baked ""database check"" with information that was inadequate to begin with. To a competent investigator, this should have been apparent as woefully inadequate. Thank you, Ben.",-0.3049,126

However, my guess is with the current, insane gun situation where any random person can legally get deadly weapons, the FBI probably has to keep track of thousands of potential assassins.
Many people write a lot of crazy stuff on the internet - it is likely a GIANT undertaking to sort out what is really important, and what not.

"Yet, no follow up on their own part.  Sounds like they wanted to learn how much YOU  knew, and nothing more.  They never followed up with regard to HIM and the threat he posed.  They conducted no investigation of him, even when there was a more explicit complaint in January.  Yet, they were very quick to interview you - like lightening fast.    I find that a bit  suspicious.  If they were truly interested in him (and not what you knew about him), they would not have interviewed you so fast, but dropped the ball on him............twice.",-0.1504,113

"honestly you can be pushed to having do much stress and anger and want to lash out.  it litterly  makes you want to die, because the pain the anger it won't go out and death would be better.  I've felt like that before and I asked the system for help but they never did.  everyone has failed me no one will help me I'm ostracized, and alone.  so yeah I can see how someone can be pushed to lash out.  the difference with me is I have a  conscious, I could never hurt innocent people though that's cowardly. but I see how people are pushed to it.  I regularly think of suicide cause the pain is so much and it takes over.  but who cares in reality no one gives a fuck, I'm just giving my two cents on why someone would maybe lash out.",-0.9707,158

people wake up the FBI didnt do anything because they were using cruz.  More reports of multiple shooters and yet the media does not investigate nor does the fbi or sheriff????  same as LV with paddock...oh and did u know paddocks autopsy revealed he died the FOLLOWING DAY AT NOON?  that was a false flag as well.  false flags do not mean real people did not die just means it was planned by the deep state and elements of the rogue fbi.  when will u wake up?  b4 or after u take the mark of the beast??,0.383,109

‚ÄúNo words‚Äù? Please... the 4 armed(and payed) first response team stood down and did not go in and eliminate the ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù. The guy had troubles and was reported and handled by all the right people at all the right times and he still supposedly did what he did on a day the school had a drill. No one stopped him before or during the incident. And the survivors are being told to blame the NRA? LOL. Just like the shooting at Sandy Hook and the Pulse something stinks...,-0.4266,103
