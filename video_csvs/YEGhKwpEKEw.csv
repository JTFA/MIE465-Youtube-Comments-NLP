"I always say this, but I really do love this type of video. Especially when they feature a different makeup artist. Seeing how they each have their own techniques and ways of applying and why. It's very interesting. I particularly love how she took into consideration the decade they were filming in, but still made it modern... In a way. I mean, if you think about it. Things are usually repeated, right? Or there's usually inspiration taken from the past, in order to create something new.",0.9792,100

"I never understood why Kate had so much makeup on for the part of Rose, especially lipstick? I believed that Edwardian girls didn't wear any makeup whatsoever, and if they did it was a minuscule bit of powder--but even that was pushing it. Was this done so the camera would pick up the changed look? Or because Rose, being American, didn't need to follow Edwardian social customs?",0.0,75

"When Titanic came out I was 18, and I was a student in Iran. At the time I used to dye my hair red (because I have a pale skin) and it is naturally curly , I used to wear reddish lipstick and everybody called me ''Rose''. I don't look like Kate Winslet at all, but I think my looks was trendy at the time because of Titanic. I was so silly I was upset because I thought Rose was fat! I was young and naive. There was a boy in our class with a rather long blonde hair and we got famous in the entire university as ''Jack & Rose''. It was very awkward at the time, but those are my memories.",-0.8358,143
