"+Keith E I’m sure that you know what you’re talking about. You have your thoughts reasoned out in a logical manner, I just don’t consider your argument to be the full story. As I previously stated, when a black person is caught killing another black person, the murderer goes to jail—the same hardly ever rings true when a police officer murders an unarmed black civilian.

The places with the most minorities may be violent due to the circumstances. Obviously, being poor doesn’t justify criminal activity, but it can create an understanding for why these things occur more often—out of desperation. I stole a hell of a lot as a child, just because I was hungry and knew I wouldn’t always have three meals a day.

Let’s look at a definition of “oppression”:
• the state of being subject to unjust treatment or control

Your description of “politicians who infiltrate their daily lives by infringing [upon] their freedom[s] through laws” sounds like it’d fit under the umbrella term of “oppression.”",-0.9644,213

"Did you read my last comment explaining specific lyrics in ""this track""? The Gospel can be heard throughout almost any song whose goal is to honor Jesus, because you don't have to explicitly state ""The Gospel is _____"" in every single song for God's message to be understood. Plus Jesus does not like repetition for the sake of repetition. I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people understand the goal of an organization called ""REACH Records"" which desires to REACH people with the Gospel. Also, the 116 Clique, which Tedashii is a member of, is based upon a Bible verse: Romans 1:16 : ""For I am UNASHAMED of the GOSPEL, for it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes..."" If that is not obviously desiring to spread the Gospel with music, I don't know what is.

So there was no probable cause for what happened next. But we ended up sitting on the curb with our hands behind our backs while they searched my car. VERY humiliating!!! Trust me, I have more!

With that being said, why would you, an ambassador of God's Kingdom, feel the need to belittle the struggles of your African American brothers and sisters in the faith? Have some compassion and try to understand where they are coming from instead of being dismissive. And please stop with the ""black on black"" crime rhetoric, that is a typical diversionary tactic. There are actually plenty of organizations within those communities that strive to reduce violence, but of course you wouldn't know that because not only do you not pay attention, but you don't care at all about the people in those communities, people such as yourself only bring up/use ""black on black"" crime as some pawn to justify a faulty premise.

"It's not really ""less about Christ"" it's just more about life in general including the experiences that come with being a believer. So, for example, ""I Can Wait"" by Trip Lee is about saving one's self for marriage or Lecrae's song ""All I Need is You"" is a song he dedicated to his wife about needing her to keep him firm in the faith and strong. This ""new route"" is a way in which Reach is attempting to reach the masses with their music and not just Christians who might already be saved so that nonbelievers can hear about what walking by faith might look like if they are new believers or lost souls that just need a positive message. ""Wild Things"" by Andy Mineo perfectly states that we should want to ""go where the wild things are"", meaning we should desire to be like Christ in not just simply keeping ourselves in the ""bubble"" of only having ""church friends"" and people we think have good lives, but rather, like Jesus himself, go and help those who need to hear an uplifting message about Christ, like Jesus himself did when He healed the leper in the Bible along with the woman by the well who was a Samaritan, and Zacchaeus, a tax collecter. Nobody but Jesus wanted to talk or have anything to do with these people, but because Jesus doesn't see the world as we do, He looked past their ""labels"" and faults and saw their need for Him in their lives.",0.9757,287

In the rest of the world, secular or Islamic governance is guilty of actual harm to Christians.  In America, the black persons worst enemy are other black people.  They talk about police brutality, but refuse to acknowledge the terrorism of hood brutality—the far greater threat.

"Tedashii is directly stating that Jesus will be ""at the end like Amen"" as in, He will be there waiting to judge our lives accordingly  when we die (""at the end"") to how we have lived them on earth. Also, the Holy Bible itself ends with the words in Revelation 22:21 : ""The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. AMEN."", so He is also literally mentioned at the end of the Bible as well. With the phrase, ""They want the blessings but I want the one they from"", Tedashii also is stating that saying things like ""bless up"" or short quips like that are all well and good as long as the people saying these things realize who their blessings actually come from, meaning, of course, the Lord. He wants people to realize that Jesus needs to be the source of our lives all of the time, not just when it's convenient for us. There are countless other quotes from this song I could draw upon, but these are that which I have noted in the original comment. The Gospel, as I'm sure you are aware, is the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which Tedashii literally states that he is just a ""messenger"" to tell people about it. Jesus states in Mark 16:15 that we should ""Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to all creation"" (such as messengers proclaim news to people). The Gospel is also referred to as the ""Good News"" such as SNAPE stated.",0.985,298
Tedashii is not saying that injustice is more important than the persecution of Christians world wide. He's just talking about the problems in AMERICA because they are going on RIGHT HERE in the the country HE LIVES IN. He's calling it out because injustice has been around for a long time and its been holding America back. He's also saying we need to stop putting it off and work together to make better justice systems. *DONT SHOOT THE MESSENGER*,0.7473,85

"You forgot to add the rest of the sentence on the ""Mission Statement"" on their page. The full quote is: ""..word spread fast across the country about a group of artists unashamed to be themselves AND REMAIN TRUE TO THEIR CONVICTIONS"" the last part of that quote is crucial because they are remaining true to the convictions that The Gospel of Christ has put upon their lives. It is implied because that's what their ""convictions"" are.",0.7672,87
You have to fix your problems at home before you try to fix the worlds. Its amazing our so called Christian brothers get so offended when blacks talk about the problems we face and the nasty effect racism still has on our societym Bringing up the plight of Christians worldwide is something we should address but you are using it to deflect.,-0.7148,64

"[Intro]
Cardec
One time for the Osage

[Chorus]
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
They want the blessings but I want the one they from
I'm just the messenger
From the beginning there is no pretending yeah I am original
I lost my son but I'm still pressing on when I wanna just give it up
Here for my kids I'm trying to live this life it'll mess you up
Say what you will I'm keeping it trill I'm here that's a miracle
Live in the light let's get it tonight yeah
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
You want the blessing but I want the one they from
I'm just a messenger
He is no fake, those Yeezy's wait
They want to get me out
Just cause I speak my mind
Mind
[Verse 1]
Run it race the clock's racing
Pick up the pace time's wasting
God is watching but He patient
Take for granted what He saying
He make the play but ain't playing
Out the way with yo plans
Throwing shade like Ray Ban
He at the end like Amen
They say they know but they doubt it
I don't want no fakes around me
CZ with diamonds that's cloudy
Stay taking L's Ronda Rousey
Roll with my squad like it's loudy
Step in the place and it's crowded
My section known to get rowdy
They can't hop in till I'm out it
Flexing, yeah tell 'em that they can till they can yeah
Always saucing all day fresh up out the pan yeah
Spill it till they get it drop it poppin’ bands yeah
Life is short don't overlook it understand yeah

[Chorus]
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
They want the blessings but I want the one they from
I'm just the messenger
I'm just the messenger
Yeah I'm the next one up
I know the way I know the way
Top floor I'm stepping up
Forgive me for messing up
Lights out like prisoners
They want the blessings but I want the one they from
I got to live it cause this life the only one
You got to get it like yeah yeah yeah
[Verse 2]
Don't shoot the messenger
I had to bring it up that's what you need me for
Can't take the message out
I go the extra mile run it like marathon Malcolm they X me out
I know the business it's war in these trenches they come with they weapons out
They got agendas so watch for pretenders who say they can help you out
This world is dark but I'm here with the spark and that’s how we gon' burn it down
I came to shut it down
Down
Tell 'em I got it, I get it
Devil is real and he busy
Get Out the world trying to kill me
You can not handle the real me
I say the system is rigged
I see injustice is real
This ain't just something we feel
When one our kids get killed
Hands up don't shoot
Man down don't move
Stand up go thru
Ransomed no loot
Blood bought like new
Same road new shoes

"grateful..bring that #Hope and fiery truth..nice to see Jackie Robinson in the video btw..God bless, on a personal scale,i understand what God recently spoke to my heart-so i realize how much of a blessing it is just to talk to God.want to be guilty of leaving  all on the table for God and family-in the process,i hope that at least a few who have been where ive been (now 2 years recovered) life's short,times are,but God ,my Father-still too good.i miss my kids,but grateful -the least I know how he feels for ALL.. especially thinking of #Jerusalem(ALL OF THE CITY)during this time as well as those forgotten or who might have forgotten themselves due to past mistakes..#NeverGiveUp
I'm just a guy who one night asked for God's grace+and he simply said ""you already got it"" it was a moment of clarity where I knew that all was forgiven and  I understood ,a taste of how the best father felt as I realized my love for my two kids and how God loves them and ALL  and even me in spite of me so immeasurably more than I can could..all I know,is if I trust in God,things will somehow someway fall into place ..#KeepYourHeadUp..

He is clearly talking about God yall.... ask this question, if he's a messenger, then what's his message??? NOT, what do you EXPECT to hear based on his recent albums, what is his message? If you listen to the song expecting to hear the old how can you hear the new, but if you listen to hear you may catch something...",0.9107,127
