There's also a few Sponsored Top Level Domains which are also overseen by ICANN (such as .COOP). Verisign is not a 'registrar' (as stated at 03:56) but a Registry. A Registrar, say GoDaddy, goes to the Registry, Verisign, to register .COM domain names, or indeed, .TV domain names on behalf of their customers.

Much of the money was near the Virgin Islands. The fruit in Australia is becoming natural and pure again. However it is considerably noticeable that once across the equator and the polaris, also called the axis, much of the fruit becomes putrid within a week even when stored atop frozen water.

""While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth.

3. This number comes from a reddit user, who 'thinks he recalls it' from a museum tour guide's comment on the value of the material.
