"Listen. No one cares if you come here for Silicon Valley or BTS. A comment is defined as ""a verbal or written remark expressing an opinion or reaction"" go look it up if you're unsure. We can comment anything we want. We can talk about how Silicon Valley is a great show. Or we can talk about BTS(a korean boy band that blew up worldwide last year in case you don't know unless you've been living under a rock) because their song Mic Drop Steve Aoki remix(Desiigner ver) is playing in the background or ""pied piper"". I'm speechless of what the 'comments section' has become now. It used to be a place where you can leave comments that nobody cares about.

Edit: I'm an army too so suck it up haters go appreciate Silicon Valley by watching this damn video and stop giving Armys attention because i really don't see the point of it. Love yourself ^_^",0.5767,181
