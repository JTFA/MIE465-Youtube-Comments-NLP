"Awesome song and great video! I am listening to this on good headphones, and is it just me or does this sound like it was created to be listened  to through phone or laptop speakers- lots of treble and no bass? One of my pet peeves is how we take music that has been created and perfected in a studio to sound rich, full and amazing and then  play it through phone speakers that sound like an AM radio. So if this was produced with that in mind, I find that interesting and kinda neat.",0.9883,103

"LYRICS
[Intro: Ally Maki & DANakaDAN]
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: DANakaDAN]
She said I was gone, and was so right
I was never present when she called me on those nights
I would always regret what would happen in those fights
Feeling so alive to almost nothing, that’s no life
But it’s your life, and what you’ve come to expect
Relationships are damaged so you got to protect
Emotions that you manage, they are starting to wreck themselves
So are the ones you can barely connect
But we are on a quest for something greater than we know
It’s often a battle of man verse the fear of the unknown
When the concept of home is a construct that’s grown
Feeling so alive to sometimes life alone
And for me that line is blurring like each day
Fighting even harder now to hold on to my faith
Barely recognizing when I’m looking at my face
That’s the life I’ve chosen and I’m searching for my place, and at my pace

[Chorus: Dia Frampton, DANakaDAN, & Ally Maki]
They say that we’re runners
But I can’t seem to disagree
They say
Gonna lose my way, gotta make mistakes
Find out who we're meant to be
And then we sing
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah
Oh-oh-oh
They say
And then we sing
Oh-oh-oh
Find out who we're meant to be
And then we sing

[Verse 2: DANakaDAN]
This scarcity of time, believe in it so much
It’s scary, and it’s often a soul crush
But varies and is extreme but follow me closely
Privilege evokes freedom that most of us don’t see
It makes us run off so fast without a clear direction or purpose
Imperfections – they surface
Is it all worth it, everything we’re unearthing?
It leaves us with feelings of unknowns and burdens
And I’ve heard it in the voices of most peers around me
They speak resounding, echoing and pounding
Same thing that’s been hounding me everyday
That this safety that we seek is what we have to blame
All I ever wanted was everything every moment at once
I wanted everything, but having it wasn’t ever enough
I wanted everything, but at every moment evolved
So instead of anything, I ran away from it all, it's so easy

[Chorus: Dia Frampton & DANakaDAN]
They say that we’re runners
They say
But I can’t seem to disagree
Gonna lose my way, gotta make mistakes
Find out who we're meant to be
Yeah
And then we sing

[Verse 3: DANakaDAN]
So when I come back I wanna do it right
But how long that takes and how I sleep at night
Is way too beyond me 'cause I will end up wandering
The fact I might not find what I’m looking for is daunting
It's haunting, has me wanting it even more
And most nights I don’t know why or who I do it for
But some nights it aces, strange sounds and faces
Towns that escape me in far off of places
And I love it, it’s this reason why I’m even writing of it
With every lesson that I’ve learned I would be nothing
Great minds have inspired and made me, I was tired of it lately
But thankfully what I admired is making me accept that there isn't a thing as coming back
'Cause with each breath I take, a new one attracts
Lost I am to you, I owe it to this pursuit
Of truth that once grew from a seed I once knew when I was young

[Chorus: Dia Frampton & DANakaDAN]
They say that we’re runners
They say
But I can’t seem to disagree
Gonna lose my way, gotta make mistakes
Yeah
Find out who we're meant to be
And then we sing

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
They say that we’re runners
But I can’t seem to disagree
Gonna lose my way, gotta make mistakes
Find out who we're meant to be
And then we sing

[Outro: DANakaDAN]
So when I come back I wanna do it right
But how long that takes and how I sleep at night
Is way too beyond me 'cause I will end up wandering",-0.0393,808
