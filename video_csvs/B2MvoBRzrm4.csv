"This is a great video for people like me who are not hacker types.  Basically he says put on a logic analyzer on chips that you do know what they are doing and look for square waves to denote a clock, and check out all the pins on the chip on the device you are trying to understand or hack to see if they are high are low, or are a clock, or whatever.  This is for when there is no ID on the chip. He just basically opens the box, puts a logic analyzer on the chip, studies the circuit, etc.  But for me, and most people reading this, the key is the logic analyzer on the chip.  Plus if you stick around, he tells you how to steal expensive new cars.  This will be an important skill during the revolution.",0.2263,158
