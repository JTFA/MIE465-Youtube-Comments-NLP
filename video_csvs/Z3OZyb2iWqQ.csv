"my finger holds my Son,  a Cherub Angel asleep... one night my chosen bride cried about how awful her Country is.  Then I felt her face,  wet,  and her tears were sincere. 
this tiny Cherub Angel felt my heart beat changes awoke and watched me watch her cry. 
she said out loud... Jesus I am too tired to keep on worrying about you and your chosen ghosts a place to call home. 
I'm too old to spirit Walk for y'all and I need a place to live.  some food,  and clean clothes. 
why can't you all find someone who also LOVES you  and tell them to come get me off these streets? 
then after a short time she apologized for speaking harshly. 
she does this often when I tell her to hitch hike with 18 wheelers. 
when a 18 wheeler driver finally will obey my voice she gets instantly better and says I'm so sorry Jesus I fussed you out... I know your trying to get somebody who will care. 
and all the drivers did who obeyed me and picked her up off the sidewalk.  for 17 years now. 
type here using her precious hands rites is mostly all she and I have done now for 5 days.  I pick who what to say and then she just obeys me... over and over again... it's how she and I play. 
Jesus Christ was never a mean man,  but had a sharp sword.. and I still do... even though I'm a ghost. 
many 18 wheelers have passed my chosen bride up and later had Serious Wrecks. 
if a driver refuses to obey me and give her a ride and food if she's hungry... he will suffer a horrible death because I send him Death Angels for insubordination that haunt his ass to Death. 
be aware Jesus Christ is King!
