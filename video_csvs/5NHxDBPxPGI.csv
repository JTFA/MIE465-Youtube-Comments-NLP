"I have been wondering... I have a decent amount of pyrite and pyrite flecks... if I had resin (I am a poor college student, and can't afford it) and I poured very shallow layers of the stuff, added a few flecks of pyrite,  repeat as necessary, could I get the illusion of gold suspended in glass?
I also have to say thanks, as your videos informed me of micromesh, which I use to polish rocks. I'm a hardcore geology enthusiast. Also, because you are the sort of guy who would try this, be careful if you polish an abalone shell, it has a rather insidious smell. I have only smelled two things (they tied) worse, basaltic rock dust, and simmered fish brains. A little bit of vineager brushed on the shell kills the smell though. Though, even with the benefit of acid reactions, it takes forever to polish it, depending on the size. It's going to be worth it though. It's three in the morning right now and I think I am rambling. Being a genius does not mean you automatically do smart things.",-0.0516,214
