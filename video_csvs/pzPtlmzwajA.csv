A cheater is like an addict u have to change for yourself. No one can make u stop. Jay-Z has to change 100 percent and never cheat again in order for their marriage to work. He has to stay faithful and this is where He is and he still seems uncertain at his ability to stay completely faithful. It takes a lot for a woman to trust again and Beyonce is PDA with him and only time will tell if He has overcome his infidelity.,0.7415,90

"People who have been married for years, have been through some serious ups and downs, just because they've been married so long, doesn't mean it's been perfect because no relationship and marriage is because people aren't perfect. When you're married, you took vows, so you're not supposed to easily give up or walk away, it takes work and unconditional love. If nobody fights for their love in a relationship or marriage, everybody will be single. Anyone who doesn't have the experience of trying rather than giving up easily will never understand. In order for you to remain with someone for years and years, you have to love them unconditionally, there are going to be ups and downs, and you may be distant for awhile during those downs, but you still love them, and will eventually come to forgive them.",0.9518,156

The acknowledgement part really shows he wants to change when a person keep things bottle up or fail to take accountability of the part they play & accept that there actions have caused pain.. not only for the one cheated on but those who were affected by the cheating. Openly exposing the transgression really helps the person to think twice owning your truth allows you to see or make an assessment of yourself to prompt change which eventually sets you free in the ability to grow.. remember he didn't have to expose it to the world he chose too.. glad they we're mature enough to work it out..,0.9217,113

I have no doubt in my mind that the only reason why some of you are going so hard to shun for Jay Z cheating on Bey, it’s simply because it’s Beyonce & Jay Z. They’re not satanist or in the Illuminati with y’all delusional asses. Cheating isn’t the the most despicable thing he can do. Stop acting like her songs about being independent, strong, and not needing male validation, she’s weak. It takes a strong woman to stay with her husband when things go wrong. I don’t condone cheating neither but for Jay to expose his fuck ups with the world, actually says a lot about him as a man. If she wants to stay with him, I guarantee it was because he was genuinely remorseful. He could’ve been a bitch about it by offering up some bullshit ass reason but he didn’t.

"This is rather typical. A famous man marries a gorgeous famous woman, and they have a child together. He cheats on her, and Beyonce informs the world of his hurtful transgression through an iconic album, ""Lemonade."" He claims that he is sorry for his actions, yet is he really? Their story is honestly disappointing because she truly believed in him, and he did what almost all famous men do... he cheated and slept around anyway. As a teenager writing this comment, I am so disappointed and let down. You would think that when people marry each other, and bring a child into this world that the husband would be faithful. I understand why they wanted to ""fight"" for their marriage because they have a daughter together. They want her life to be as normal and stable as possible. I hate that this is what kids are seeing while growing up. This is why so many boys nowadays treat girls like objects. It shouldn't come as a surprise; just look at the male celebrities they're looking up to. What a terrible example for young children. In my opinion, fighting for a marriage is unnecessary if the love is actually real. Jay-Z needs to keep in mind that Beyonce didn't have to stay with him. He must know that Beyonce could have just about any man she wants. I really hope he has learned his lesson because he has children to take care of, and he has a responsibility to be a GOOD role model for them. This is just so disappointing.",0.6274,293

He just wants to camouflage the fact of him being a cheater  with that stupid 'gentleman' look. If it was a woman the cheater and she was on TV saying yes I did cheat on my husband ...oh god... I'm sure the world wouldn't accept that and she would be calificada as a whore! and cause it was a man who di it and recognised it is a hero?! No way.

"those of you using the excuse that he is a celebrity and has women constantly around should know that that is irrelevant. people cheat regardless of how well they've done for themselves. he cheated as jay z just as much as he would've cheated if he was the average joe. my own father was extremely unfaithful to his wife who he had children with and basically grew up with. his wife chose to stay with him 20+ years and it's now that they're much older they are deciding to separate. though he is my father and i'm technically an illegitimate child, this taught one lesson: once a cheater, always a cheater.",-0.9349,121
