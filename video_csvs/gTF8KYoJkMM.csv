"Concentration camps, as you know them, were NOT invented by the British in South Africa. They were called the same thing, but they were totally different in very important ways. So different in fact, that the Nazi's could disguise their death camps behind the concentration camp label.
There's a reason South Africa could easily recruit a quarter of a million men to fight for the British during WWI. The British soldiers who were running those concentration camps in South Africa during the Boer War had a higher chance of dying from starvation than the civilians in the camp. Plus the civilians in said camps had a greater chance of surviving the famine than civilians not in the camps. The soldiers, who were themselves living on starvation rations, were sharing their limited amounts of food with the people in the camps in an attempt to keep them alive. Which resulted in the deaths of more of the British soldiers from starvation and disease.
The famine itself was from an ending of a lengthy and abnormal wet period, to the more normal arid conditions, on top of the Boer habit (European habit) of ignoring local food  crops in favor of the European varieties that weren't able to survive the much dryer climate of South Africa.",0.6297,232

"I appreciate you saying that. It wasn't a great video from my perspective for back-end reasons, but I'm definitely happy to have it out regardless.

I do want to clarify that the implication from my end wasn't intended that way. It is meant as a challenge idea for the viewer. The term concentration camp came out of the Boer war - a war which most people don't know about and which points further at my notion of Canada as being a people dragged into British actions. It stuck with many viewers who then asked for more info, which was my goal. My intent, as with all my other videos, is to provide provoking moments that send people to Google. As I mentioned, we aren't intending to be an explainer series. My videos are rarely if ever actually meant to teach history. I think this is clearer in many of my other videos, but less so as a Tom Scott guest post (specifically this one with its troubles).

It isn't that I disagree with you. It is lazily done. I had no intention on following up or explaining further. Most of our videos come with little lazy notes meant to provoke a search for more info. It might not be for everyone, which is fine. I totally understand. It's just my style.",-0.8929,247

It doesn't matter much how flawed a person is in their personal life, as long as they can do their job well without that interfering.
When I read a book, or watch a movie, I don't care about the people who made it. Following the personal lives of celebrities is pointless. If we went through life getting hung up on the imperfections of everybody involved in the production of the things we use and consume, we'd never get anywhere.
On the other side of the coin, even good people are imperfect. People can do incredible things, but it's those things that they do that we should idolize, not the people themselves. I should like to think people admire and appreciate some of the things I do and create, but I wish they wouldn't put me on a pedestal for it. I'm only human.

After King, regardless of his (many) bad decisions, the idea of Canada became the country of Canada. Not everyone agrees with it (Native, Quebecois, etc) but it's much more than it was before him.

"Yo, I've played his piano. Which sounds weird, but we went to his house for a school trip because he was born nearby and my brother went to the same high school as him, and basically I was 7, and played his piano (they do not allow kids to do this anymore, as far as I know)",0.3508,65
You dare say that the garbage fire that is the USA is the empire we bow to I will fight you to the grave!,-0.784,25
"You don't have to be American to think that's a commentary about Trump. Apparently you only have to be not Canadian. Or a person who automatically defends anything someone says who is wearing flag pants. I find it especially repulsive that he talks about how fighting the Nazis was pointless and abstracts it away as ""being in Europe"". But he must be a really nice guy that Tom likes and recommends him despite the obvious white supremacist...well...at least...sympathy. I would have just kindly asked him to use his abundant natural slime production to get all that nonsense all the way up his own ass.",0.5849,118
