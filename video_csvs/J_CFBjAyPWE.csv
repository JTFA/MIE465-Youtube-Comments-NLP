"A message to everyone that continues to compare our views with the ones of bboom bboom and says that we don't work hard enough and that we are lazy
Can you please think about this a moment? Momoland, after two months, is still promoting anywhere and everywhere while our girls stopped promoting or doing performances in general more than 2 weeks ago! Know what our views started to slow down something like 2 weeks ago, do you think it's a coincidence?
You have to know that doing perfomances and promoting has a big influence in youtube views since, if it's done well and the song is catchy (just like bboom bboom from our dear momoland), it keeps high the number of new comers
So please, all the comments lately are about how you feel sad about the views and everything and i can understand that, it's normal. But if you say it like that you're just making other people sad, you're not encouraging them. So try to say what you want to say with other words that can hype the ones who are reading not to discourage them
Said so, hope you all understood, have a good day~",0.9609,216
