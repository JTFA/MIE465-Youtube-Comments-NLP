I don't think cats which are living inside and can't go outside for themselves are very happy. Cats like to go and explore actively rather than to just observe you cook or watching the outside through a cage. They also like hunting small animals. They are much more similar to undomesticated animals than dogs.,0.8961,58

"My cat also loves everything with wheat on it, even seitan :D As for the food in general, maybe you should make him get used to eat a determined amount per day, even if he asks for more. My cat, if I didn't limit the food she eats, would want to eat all day! And that's not acceptable because she would get fat and sick because of it. What do I do then? In the morning, I give her a bigger amount of food because she's super crazy, like she didn't get fed for years ^_^ So, I divide the food in three portions and give her 2 in the morning at 7am and the other in the afternoon, like 3pm. Before bedtime, only for a matter of routine and because I know she would want to eat again and she doesn't eat from 3pm to 7am (whitch is a long time), I give her 2 bits of different treats. But, because she almost doesn't chew her food in the morning and swallows it really quick, 1 of the portions I put inside a snack ball so she has to roll it and roll it to get to her food - with this, I manage her eating rhythm and she gets a litter exercise. :) I hope I helped.",0.9599,245

My kitchen is too small n messy I close the door when I cook for fear of danger. He put his paw on the stove glass top( ninjas both of them)., the Vet bill came to nearly £90/-
Both goes out in a leash but as he said we need to watch them carefully as if they do get frightened anything can happen. One is not scared of dog whilst the other is. I am working on building his confidence up. I trash talk any dogs we see 😁",0.6561,178
