"***The Gospel of John is a persuasive argument of the deity of Jesus. It concentrates on presenting Jesus as the Word, that is, God (1:1) Who became a man (1:14). Thus John meticulously records the statements and describes the miracles of Jesus that can only be attributed to God Himself.

***Jesus called himself, ""the bread of life,"" (6:35, 41, 48, 51).

***(The light of the world), (8:12; 9:5).

***(The Door for the Sheep), (10:7,9).

***(The Good Shepherd), (10:11,14).

***(The Resurrection and the life), (11:25).

***(The Way, The Truth, the Life), (14:6).

***(The True Vine), (15:1,5).

***Each of these statements begins with the words, ""I'AM,"" recalling God's revelation of His name, ""I AM,"" to Moses. (See Exodus 3:14).

***These are Jesus clear claims to deity: He was not a mere man!

***Then there are the signs of Jesus deity.

***Miracles in the Gospel of John are called ""signs"" because they point to Jesus divine nature. John records 
seven such signs:

***(Changing water into wine), (2:1-11).

***(Healing man's son), (4:46-54).

***(Healing a lame man), (5:1-9).

***(Multiplying bread and fish), (6:1-14).

***(Walking on Water). (6:15-21).

***(Healing a Blind Man). (9:1-7).

***(Raising Lazarus from the Dead), (11:38-44).

***These miracles show that Jesus IS GOD: He possesses power over nature.

***Other indications of Jesus deity include the testimonies of John the Baptist.

***(1:32-34)<---And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

***(Nathanael), (1:49)<---Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.

***(The Blind Man), (9:35-38)<---Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

***(Martha), (11:27)<---She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

***(Thomas), (20:28)<---And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.

***(Not to mention Jesus own words), (5:19-26)<---For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.

***John urges us to trust in Jesus for eternal life.

***Our trust is built on our belief that;

(1): The Father is in Christ, and Christ is in the Father. (10:38; 14:10-14).
(2): Christ came from God. (16:17-30), and God sent Him. (11:42; 17:8-21); See 6:29).
(3): He is the Son of God. (6:69; 11:27; 20:31).

***John reveals the bible's most important message: Believe and follow Jesus, because he is the way to eternal life!!!",0.991,1015

3% is 2 inches of extra height if you were six feet tall on Earth. While it doesn't sound like a issue the space suits are custom designed to fit the wearer. An extra 2 inches of height would make the suit very uncomfortable since at the end of the day it's just a very fancy suit of armor.,-0.3618,63

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
