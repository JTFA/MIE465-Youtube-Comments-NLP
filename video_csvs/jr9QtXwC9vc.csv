PT Barnum was a horrible person. He bought a slave and told people she was George Washington's nurse. When she died he did  a public autopsy and charged admission.,-0.836,32
PenBot this movie is incredible you seem to just have bad taste 💀 also don’t judge it by the trailer,-0.5423,22
"Please don't mind me...
But this story is not true. P T Barnum was a trickster. He exploited people. He faked a lot of stuff. The movie portrays him as a guy who focused on bodily differences and was not ashamed of people who had them. In real life, he _hired_ several since they were kids, and earned money *using* them and the fact that they were different.
It's okay to think this deserves a award, because several here don't know the real story of Barnum. I personally think they should have focused on the people he ""cared"" for than Barnum himself. This is not what is recorded in history. I don't appreciate this.

"The movie wasn't meant to be 100% historically accurate.  What if the lead actors name was John Boobyhead?  Would you still have hated it?  I think the movie was meant to entertain and does just that (in my opinion).  I've heard many comments about people who didn't like it initially for that same reason but enjoyed it more the second time because they were able to accept the movie for was it is (an entertaining musical).  Obviously, that's why a lot of critics gave the movie negative reviews and it didn't win an Oscar.",-0.4807,106
