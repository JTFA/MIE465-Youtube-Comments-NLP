"Baghdad batteries are real. Two of them in series  are comparable to an AA alkaline battery. 

Pro tip: if you put your battery in series with a chicken egg, you get unlimited free energy! (JK)

However, there are ways to actually get free energy. 

1. Move into your parents' basement. They will pay the electricity bills. 

2. Move to Kosovo. The entire country has stopped paying for electricity, and the rest of the European power grid is still supplying them.

PS: I actually honestly genuinely believe that there are some forms of aliens (whether intelligent or otherwise) somewhere in the universe, and in fact doubt that its reasonable to believe otherwise. Our planet exists in the ""Goldilocks zone"", perfect for supporting carbon based life forms (us, and every other living thing on earth), and I find it difficult to believe that nowhere else in the universe is there another area which has supported some form of life forms, whether carbon based, silicon based or otherwise. If our planet was in a different area in orbit, we wouldn't even be here to speculate the possibility or other life forms in the universe, so its not exactly a huge leap.",0.9083,180
