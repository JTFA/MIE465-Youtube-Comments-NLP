I notified Simone Biles Reps about Mattress Firm defrauding consumers out of thier hard earned money by selling consumers used mattresses as brand new in thier outlet and mega center locations. I told her reps to notify simone of this so she can stop advertising for the foster kids program that mattress firm has on tv and on print because also with the foster kids program donation when mattress firm states they donated $1 million to the fosters kids program the statement is false because most of the money came from consumers donating at the store for the foster kids program by donating cash or supplies. Simone biles reps they told me no simone will continue to advertise for mattress firm regarding the foster kids program. This is not right simone should not be celebrated she is a disgrace. she choose money over doing the right thing she choose money against standing with the consumer that have been defruaded by mattress firm in thier outlet and mega center locations.,-0.8823,175
