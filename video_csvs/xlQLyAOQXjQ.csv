I love your videos! Maybe that eyeliner shape isnt right for you and thats why youre not really feeling it anymore? I have a pretty similar eyeshape to you and I was in the same situation. Now I wear eyeliner almost everyday! Because I stopped lining them all the way in. Like starting the line five milimeters onto the eye and that part being the thickest. And something else that helped was also doing a line straight out and not curved!

Everyone was too tired at the end of the night (12-2 am) to even care. So, take it or leave it, your slurps and popcorn have mold residue in them...but hey, that stuff is bad for you anyway, maybe people shouldnt consume them.

 Actually you would be pretty surprised at some the stuff that you will find in our 711 locations now adays  ... most of them have some really cool, cute, random but very useful, things in most of our stores now.☺
