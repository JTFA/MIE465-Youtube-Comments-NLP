"*No Olaplex? Girl you wilding!* Love this look but the upkeep is an expensive nightmare.
If anyone is doing this at home leave it a day or two between bleaching/lightening & applying your fashion colours. Bleach makes your hair very porous. My '10 wash' fashion colour stained my hair cuz my hairdresser didn't wait. Took me months in a salon (€€€$$$!) to fix. Also prepare to lose some length if you're going from super dark to light. A trim saves ravaged & split ends. Hair masks before & after are the key to keeping your hair & scalp healthy. Cool or cold water helps keep your colour. Try avoid dry shampoo, dandruff shampoo or too much hairspray as these strip colour too.",0.8802,149
