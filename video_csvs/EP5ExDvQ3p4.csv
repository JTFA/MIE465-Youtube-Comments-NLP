"Do I have to be the dick and say it? I think Thanos is going to get the Tesseract from Loki, then kill Loki. Great shocking twist. Nobody will see it coming. Huge loss but a livable loss. Thanks has no need for Loki. Loki was simply a pawn ever since Thanos gave Loki the mind stone. That's right. Thanos actually had the mind stone, and gave it to Loki in the form of the scepter. Loki has always been a pawn. With allies such as Ebony Maw and Proxima Midnight, what use does Thanos actually have for Loki? Plus it's a great way to establish Thanos is not playing around. I think Thanos will board the Asgardians ship, lay waste to most if not all Asgardians, (those are the bodies Loki is stepping over), knock Thor into outer space where he lands on the Guardians windshield, then in a ""can't beat em so join em"" mentality, Loki offers the Tesseract to Thanos. Then Thanos kills Loki. The old jumping sides routine is getting old for Loki and it may have finally caught up to him.

I hate saying it but it's Captain America. Chris Evans has hinted for a while that he's done. I think Hemsworth might stick around since he enjoyed working on Ragnarok and with Taika. I think Ironman will continue to mentor here and there. I know in comic books the characters die and come back but these are movies. I didn't want Wolverine to die either. I don't like it! Just sad....,-0.9168,79
"I hate the thought of this, but I think either Cap or Bucky is getting the axe. Main reasoning is that they haven't left any story plots for Steve Rodgers after Civil War, he kinda just disappears for a time, and of course Chris Evans' comments about departing. If this does happen we could see Falcon or a stronger case, Bucky, become the next Cap as he does for a time in the comics.  Bucky's winter-soldier story arch with Hydra came to a close in Civil War for the most part--leaving his plotline kinda dry as well.

  Steve Rodgers death would give Bucky a new story, at the same time this could also be why Bucky gets axed.  I strongly believe one of these characters will be gone after Infinity War, we'll see how it pans out!

 Also, I think there was a comic arch where Ironman joins the Guardians of the Galaxy...I can see Tony going galaxy bound with the Guardians--leading into Guardians 3 plot.",-0.9776,184

That ties the tension between them up, reunites the Avengers and keeps Tony Stark a viable interwoven character in future films while taking the ""suiting up"" portion out of RDJ's requirements.  Maybe the next Ironman's suit AI is Tony Stark's personality.  I also think vision, as we know him, will die, but that the residual power from the soul gem will stay within him to keep him ""alive"".  I'm somewhat inclined to say Hawkeye and Black Widow don't make it out either, or at least one of them.  Maybe BW sacrificing herself to save Hawkeye or vice versa since they were shown to be so close to each other in AOU.  It's exciting to think of the possibilities.",0.4255,184

"Tony Stark didn't start all of this he had nothing to do with acquiring Tesseract, That's all Odin and Red Skull. SHIELD was responsible for activating it. After it was activated Stark was just trying to use it in ways to give us an advantage, which then of course lead to Ultron.",0.5106,57
Tony Stark will die at the end of Avengers 4.  It's a given to me. He had that vision in Age of Ultron of the team dying.  He will do something to save them all that costs him his life.,0.0772,44

"When it comes to box office records, I never hear about the fact that the main reason so many people saw the film (multiple times in some cases) was FOR THE 3D. That means virtually everyone was paying extra for those 3D screenings. It was automatically going to make a large percentage more than an equivalent blockbuster that did NOT depend on 3D for its appeal. I'm sure Force Awakens would have surpassed it if everyone paid for 3D for that (without researching the numbers but still...).",0.4767,97

"marvel is so genius with what they do, not only will the end a 10 year long story arc they will also kill off actors which are increasingly cost them more money. technically Dark Knight Rises was a finale to that set of superhero movies. Go big Marvel take a huge risk like you have before kill Iron Man and Captain America and DON'T have other people put on those suits.",-0.4767,75
my bet is iron man die. tony stark replace uncle ben role.,-0.5994,14
"no one has to die but maby newer characters come in play more after avengers 4? wouldn't be surprised if someone bites the dust though.

maby tony doessnt die but retires and sits on a couch eating pizza pretending to be an a.i. but he´s really in hawaii or something chillin.

i wish avatar had more 3d outwards, there was a fly and some embers but they didn't do it with debris or dragons mouths biting at us or when he turns with 
the guns in the robot suit. i like the extended or longest version, whatever.

could be nice with a master and commander sequel. first one was good. or have crowe in the next pirate movie? if there is one or do a sequel to his robin hood, 
you know the real story we all know. would be nice.

guess i arrived after rewind :(. sounds fun.

have you tried to have a movie corner or something for indie movies, dramas and so on? even like a 20 minute thing perhaps? in a warm light, dark wood, libraryish setting ;).
but with movies instead of books.

love the shows.",0.9837,219

"rvmt81 I hope not, they often said she was instrumental to the organization of the studio. Maybe she took a step back from the camera. I mean, all she did on the show was read Twitter questions, and since they have implemented the four person panel including the host, she just doesn't do it anymore. Another bts person. And on screen we get Ashley, Natasha (oohhh Natasha...), and Sinead.",0.4404,84
technically hawkeye could die and Ronin could take his place in avengers 4. clint wont die,-0.8316,17
"the logic goes like this, no one will die (permanently) in avengers 3 because Avengers 4 has the super mega 64 character splash panel in the 3rd act. I believe captain America will be last man standing on earth  and as he takes on thanos he utters the line ""i can do this all day"" at which point thanos breaks his shield and kills him, tony stark and the other avengers arrive but there too late. if it plays out that way I am certain there will be lots of tears in the theater.",0.1406,103
