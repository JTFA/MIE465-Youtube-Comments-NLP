Huayna Capac had designated Huascar as new heir, but died before the news got to the capital, after the civil war Atahualpa decimated and pillaged several regions  in vengeance for suporting his brother. Pizarros forces were outnumbered over 1000 to one and still won, Atahualpa was well treated in captivity with access to many concubines including some of his sisters and frequently dinning with Pizarro and his oficers, He was killed later for having Huascar a few other brothers of them killed on the way to negotiate with Pizarro mainly thanks to a plot by a translator from one of the villages he destroyed (he was guilty though). Pizarro first intended to create a  kingdom vasal to the crown of Spain keeping some existing structure, but soon became unviable in part cause of constant attacks by Atahualpas forces and some of his brothers,",-0.9761,189
