"For those that’re curious, it’s because they’re so isolated from humanity.
Many species are innately curious of humans because they have not had a fear of humans bred into them from hundreds of years of being hunted by us. You mostly see it in animals native to isolated islands, and this lack of fear has caused dozens of species to go extinct as we hunted them for food or sport. The dodo being the most famous example.

Antarctic researchers are frequently approached by penguins, who also for obvious reasons have no fear of humans.",0.1721,108
