"The correct timestamp for the Joel Ferguson interview is 23:17.  

He says Nassar acted by himself despite a report coming out that 14 MSU people were alerted. He insinuates it's not as bad as Penn State when in fact it is worse. He cites all the other really important things (like fundraising!) Simon does which would suffer if she left. He says the 'ladies' will have ""something happening in their favor"" insinuating payouts will help everyone move on. He reveals the BoT only spent 10 minutes of a five hour meeting discussing whether they should support Simon. (This meeting was held while victims were still providing impact statements). 

Yet another tone deaf ""statement"" from another short sighted MSU official.

Edit: He also baits the NCAA into launching an investigation, which, they do. What a total idiot.",-0.1152,160

"They won't but the NCAA needs to drop a nuke on MSU. Forget fanhood, rivalries, etc. Burn it down. To have it happen and then say shit like this (AND THEY ARE ALL SAYING SHIT LIKE THIS) is proof that the slate needs cleaned.

Burn it down.",-0.8519,56

"Well, tthe NCAA launched an investigation into MSU about 12 hours after this stupid dumbass sneered that they're not competent to handle it. I guess ""this Nassar thing"" is bigger than Ferguson's unevolved brain can process. What a disgusting piece of garbage. How dare he be so dismissive of these victims and the university's failure to protect them. This arrogant motherfucker needs to be gone. Like yesterday.
