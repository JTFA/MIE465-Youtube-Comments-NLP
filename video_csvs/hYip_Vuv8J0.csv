I remember when Bitcoin was worthless and mostly used for buying drugs on Silk Road and dubious services on the deep web.  

I suppose it was only a matter of time before the global economy got bad enough that the elite realized they couldn't trust any major country or corporation to not royally mess up and devalue themselves horrifically. It's definitely a smart way to diffuse the Too Big To Fail situation.
