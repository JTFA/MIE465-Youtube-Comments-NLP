"Use a Notarized Affidavit of Truth to declare the fraudulency of their unilateral, presumptive adhesion contracts, as timeless international contract law requires evidence of agreement by 2 informed, competent parties. Their failure to sign, while legalized by U.S.C. which is not law, lawfully renders the contract null and void Ab Initio, for lack of agreement. Further, if either party did not receive something of inherent physical value, such as a car or a house or a shoe or lawful money such as silver, not fiat currency such as FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES or electronic funds transfer, then the contract is null for lack of ""consideration"". Furthermore, if you had to sign it as the only way to get what the adverse party was offering, then you signed under duress, which also nullifies contracts. If used against a corporation the corp lawfully can't rebut it, and no person can lawfully rebut it for a corp, so after 30 days your affidavit becomes the legit law of the case, unappealable, equal to a court order.
