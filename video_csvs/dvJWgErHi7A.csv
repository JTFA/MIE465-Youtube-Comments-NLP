"Could CMT have done a worse job with this series? Every other year there have been 22 episodes, with 11 in the first half and 11 in the second half, now all of a sudden there's only 8 episodes with ""to be continued in June.    This year CMT has used Nashville as a stringer for their new ""unscripted"" series, if you're just going to keep Nashville around as fodder for your other crap shows CMT.. why even bother?  Stick to your daily reruns of Roseanne, it's the only thing CMT can pull off, running reruns of shows that sucked!    CMT should stand for  Canned Manipulative Trash!",-0.901,120

"Father God, through Jesus Christ, the Alpha and the Omega, the Creator of ALL THINGS loves you so very much. He wants you to come to Him with all of your weaknesses: physical, emotional, and spiritual. Rest in the comfort of His Presence, remembering that nothing is impossible with Jesus. Pry your mind away from your problems so you can focus your attention on our Lord. Understand that He is able to do immeasurably more than all you ask or imagine. When anxiety attempts to wedge its way into your thoughts, remind yourself that Jesus Christ is your Comforter and your Shepherd. Give yourself completely to Him this very moment. Though it may feel frightening, the safest place to ever be is in the loving  care of Jesus Christ. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  (Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.91,198

"I don't know how they are gonna fix things in six episodes especially when they found out they were being axed. They would of had to quickly do alot of rewrites. I've only stuck with it because of Scarlett and gunner, I want them to end up together but they ruined scarletts character last season and they have barely had a scene this season so I don't know if they can fix it or if it will end up feeling rushed which I feel it will do! And the same with Avery and juliette if he cheats on her how do they fix them two in six episodes, it just doesn't seem possible! 16 episodes was not enough!",-0.8743,125

"The ""classic"" line from CMT's Batchelor CMT mess:  ""He Loves You Enough to Throw Up"", and that was the highlight of the show! 

So let me get this straight:  When Nashville was carried by a ""real network - ABC"" there were 22 shows every year, that's what the fans got used to. Last year CMT had the decency to follow that legacy and there were 22 shows.  This year which so many fans have looked forward to has only 8 episodes so far  - to be continued in June.  And Nashville was displaced to show CMT's new show Music City - which is ""The Bachelor"" with a little country music thrown in.  CMT has proved how $$ hungry and tasteless they really are!  The ""suits"" at CMT who obviously know nothing about country music or its fans think that the lemmings who follow Nashville the series will just view along to this tripe that gives a bad name to country music.  CMT. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  YOU SUCK BIG ONES.   It would have been better to let the series die than to try and manipulate its viewers into watching ""Batchelor CMT style""  CMT has zero style, just suits who know nothing about country music and it's fans.  CMT speciaizes in running Roseanne re-runs, so I guess We shouldn't have expected better of them!  For Deacon, Will, Scarlett, Gunner and the rest of the cast .. you have my sympathies.  Nashville was so vital for focusing attention on the Nashville music scene, ABC brought us amazing music producers like Buddy Miller, Colin Linden and so many songwriters, now We just get CMT's Batchelor Madness.  It would have been so much better if the show had been allowed to die with dignity, not this sure death by mediocrity !",0.8594,334
"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends! 

John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved this world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. 

So friends, Jesus LOVES you!

He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you! 

The Lord came down in the Person of Jesus to die, and 3 days later, rise again!

He did this because of His Sheer Love for us! 

Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him! (John 6:37, paraphrased)

So my friends, come to Jesus today! 

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He will forgive you, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

You don't need a lot of faith or a fancy prayer to make Jesus your Lord and Savior. 

Simply call upon Him from the heart, with mustard seed size faith. 

He will hear you speedily! 
You will be saved! For all those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13) 
Hallelujah!

Shalom, friends!",0.9967,221
