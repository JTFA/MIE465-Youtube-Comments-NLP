"As a nice guy I feel slapped in the face. You know how many midnight ice cream runs I have done? How many times I have made dinner, cocktails, taken her plate afterwards, did the dishes made her a sundae to nibble on while we watched a romcom. You know how many times a day I tell her ""I love her"" and that she is ""A breath of fresh air"" to me? Do you have any clue what its like to leave work on you lunch break to kill a few spiders at home for her? Do you know how many random bouquets of flowers I have sent to her work? Do you know the high I get from seeing her smile? Do you know how patient I have to be while she decides what to eat for breakfast brunch lunch and dinner!?  Do you know how long I held her in my arms and told her ""I'll be here until my body turns to dust"" when her mother died!? NO, YOU HAVE NO F***ING CLUE!! 

Don't tell me bad boys bring heaven to you. I may not be as tall and muscular, but I have brought more heaven to my lady than any fool with biceps.",0.821,237

Love's my religion but he was my faith
Something so sacred so hard to replace
Fallin' for him was like fallin' from grace
All wrapped in one he was so many sins
Would have done anything everything for him
And if you ask me I would do it again

No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say ""all good boys go to heaven""
But bad boys bring heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say ""all good boys go to heaven""
But bad boys bring heaven to you

You don't realize the power they have
Until they leave you and you want them back
Nothing in this world prepares you for that
I'm not a sinner he wasn't the one
Had no idea what we would become
There's no regrets I just thought it was fun

No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true

It's automatic

I still remember the moment we met
The touch that he planted
The garden he left
I guess the rain was just half that effect

No need to imagine

"é minha religião
Mas ele era minha fé
Algo tão sagrado
Tão difícil de substituir
Me apaixonar por ele foi como sair da graça
Tudo em um
Ele era tantos pecados
Faria qualquer coisa
Tudo por ele
E se você me perguntar
Eu faria de novo

Não preciso imaginar
Porque eu sei que é verdade
Eles dizem: Todos os garotos bons vão para o céu
Mas os garotos maus levam o céu até você
É automático
É simplesmente o que eles fazem
Eles dizem: Todos os garotos bons vão para o céu
Mas os garotos maus levam o céu até você

Você não percebe o poder que eles tem
Até eles te deixarem e você querer eles de volta
Nada no mundo te prepara para isso
Eu não sou uma pecadora
Ele não era o cara certo
Não tinha ideia do que iríamos nos tornar
Não há arrependimentos
Eu só pensei que fosse ser divertido

Não preciso imaginar
Porque eu sei que é verdade
Eles dizem: Todos os garotos bons vão para o céu
Mas os garotos maus levam o céu até você
É automático
É simplesmente o que eles fazem
Eles dizem: Todos os garotos bons vão para o céu
Mas os garotos maus levam o céu até você

Eu ainda me lembro do momento em que nos conhecemos
O toque que ele plantou
O jardim que ele deixou
Eu acho que a chuva foi só metade daquele efeito

Não preciso imaginar
Porque eu sei que é verdade
Eles dizem: Todos os garotos bons vão para o céu
Mas os garotos maus levam o céu até você
É automático
É simplesmente o que eles fazem
Eles dizem: Todos os garotos bons vão para o céu
Mas os garotos maus levam o céu até você",-0.296,301
