"A bit overused with the slow mo since the camera works brought a more dynamic feel to the video, just too much contrast in the techniques imo. Also i kinda enjoy the video until the bold texts appeared, should have been in a thin/light font for the elegance of it (which i think is what you guys was aiming for). A bit of a let down compare to the last video. Call me hater all you want, i just didn't feel the video this time.",0.8402,96

Followed you guys on instagram and where ever I can. I may no longer use my fingers the same way, but the joy it gives me to see you guys in action. You have been a key inspiration in my cardistry and magic(though you guys center on cardistry). You guys have been a stepping stone. I may no longer progress further but it doesn't stop me from picking up a deck ever so often. Thanks for still being awesome! This new deck is awesome.. Look away from the haters, but keep their words in mind, so later on you prove them wrong(well...I'm sure you guys have proven them wrong a lot of times). Will bust open my wallet or savings for this deck hahaha.",0.9719,179
I have no interest in Cardistry (i'm a magician) but i have to say this must be the most impressive trailer for a card deck i have ever seen.

"I'm not trying to argue here, but really? It's like telling people they can never tell how good a meal is just because they can't cook. That's so generic and wrong man. If i was a true hater, i would just leave a dislike and forget about this video. But since i am working part time in a movie studio and a near full time graphic designer, i guess i know quite enough what i was talking about. And you really don't want to explain what was your intention or how so if i spoke nonsense, but just that? I'm really disappointed. I used to be your biggest fan man, much that you guys even promised sending me those cards back in the V1 day, and i'm still waiting. I guess having a straight convo is quite expensive nowadays. Anyway, thanks for the reply. I'll just leave a generic compliment here to meet your expectation for a comment section: "" Keep up the good work guys!""",-0.8082,186
