"Cool!

Here in S√£o Paulo/Brazil we have advertisements in the metro that is similar, from inside the train looks almost like a video but they are just frames.

But, of course, this video is much more creative and has a amazing message.

Part of the metro company explanation (translation by google)

""How In Tunneling Works

The in tunnel technology is owned by the Canadian company Digital Underground Media. The producer receives from Brazilian advertisers regular digital films, adapts to the panel and transmits to ViaQuatro directly from its operations center in Vancouver, Canada. The exchange of information is done through the internet.

The panels in the tunnel are made up of thin LED columns spaced out over 300 meters. They emit luminous signals with a frequency determined by sensors that continuously measure the speed of the ViaQuatro train. As soon as the train enters the section of panels, the system calculates this synchronization.

Film forms in the brains of passengers

The technique of displaying the films requires perfect synchronization between the speed of the train and the transmission of the light signals. Without this, the passenger would not be able to view the video. The human eye receives the light signals and the film is forming in the brains of Line 4-Yellow passengers on the moving train, giving the impression that the windows of the cars have turned into TV screens.""",0.9791,259

But let me rise while the cheese is devoured and i am high on the amount of set traps and when i look down i will see the ones on the bottom who support everyone above them and they will be rewarded, for right now the cheese is large and the mice are few, but if the cheese was gone then i would be the highest but that is near impossible, those few are lucky for they can set the first trap, you can set the first trap.",0.0129,152
