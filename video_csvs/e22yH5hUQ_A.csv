"Issues with this. On the issue of public funds. In most cases the public funds come in the form of sales of low interest and high security bonds. The local jurisdictions make up a lot of this through in stadium taxes, beverages like beer are the hardest hit. In Seattle the stadium bonds are financed through a hotel and restaurant tax. This puts most of the burden of paying for them on out of town visitors and not the locals. The State also sold over $100 million in lottery tickets to help fund the baseball stadium. So ways to finance these are there that don't stress the local taxpayers. Most infrastructure projects require 100% public money and are often paid for through things like increased property and fuel taxes. 
Then if placed in a proper location the stadium can revitalize an area. This increases property values and the tax generated from it. In the SODO region of Seatte PTs tripled in the two years after Safeco Field opened and saw another jump when the football stadium was finished. Of course put in in a bad location away from areas of activity and people and their money don't stay (See Philadelphia's stadium complex on the outskirts of the city versus Detroit's downtown complex or Seattle's) . New stadiums attract business to the area, most often entertainment oriented. Seattle is still seeing growth in this area over a decade after the completion of the football stadium.",0.9489,264

The cost is ""externalised"" to the people who live near the hole or downstream somewhere.

Yes that is flipping and highway robbery. But the Olympic community gets to con a country into building them 220-50 Billion dollar venues every two years that are never used again. That is a bigger waste than all NFL stadiums combined in two years. Think about that next time you get to watch some random sport for only three weeks.,-0.0258,64
"You may have a point with museums. Some malls are subsidized after they start to struggle (as with many privately owned public spaces), but most are privately constructed with private money. However, with stadiums, there are a number of differences. Depending on the sport, especially with football, the value of the stadium drastically declines without a team to play in it. Some stadiums can have somewhat alternate uses like concerts and such, but those don't occur with the frequency that is expected when a stadium is built. We have plenty of cities with unused stadiums in decrepit conditions due to the lack of use. NBA stadiums can somewhat be repurposed though. Another difference is the sheer cost of investment and the lifetime of the stadium proposed by organizations like the NFL and NBA. They demand larger and larger stadiums in too short of a time span, leaving no doubt that the city is not making an ""investment"", but paying a hefty cost. A museum doesn't just project that it will leave the city and therefore as long as there is net profit from tickets while accounting for staff and upkeep, the museum will pay for itself eventually. This is much harder when both a team is liable to leave any year, and the owners get the lions share of the profit. But the biggest difference is probably how these two public works are marketed to the public. Though it's possible for a museum to make a profit, that's not a big selling point. The point is as you say- public entertainment (though those that don't fit that criteria anymore should probably be repurposed). And while the enjoyment for the city is a selling point for stadiums, it's not it's only one, and a weak selling point at that- especially when you consider that often times there is a perfectly good stadium ALREADY available. The stadium is marketed as an investment that will yield great economic returns. This is simply not true for the factors stated earlier (no stability, high turnover rate). They aren't honest that for the vast majority of situations, the entertainment is paired with a city or state-wide cost, not delusions that the city will both profit and have the entertainment available. It's the dishonesty that people should be wary about.",0.9878,428
