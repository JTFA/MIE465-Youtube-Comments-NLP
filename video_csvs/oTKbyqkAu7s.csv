"""Not machine guns according to ATF."" I'm talking about common sense, not bogus definitions. AR-15 are military weapons.

We're talking about what to do going forward. This latest shooting could have been prevented had they not sold this nut a gun, for example. We can't do anything about it NOW -- that doesn't mean we can't prevent it in the FUTURE. Seems simple enough to me. The millions of guns out there? Not the issue right now, although I would encourage programs where you can exchange your guns for money or gift cards, especially ones you don't use or are old. That's really not the issue though. The issue is doing SOMETHING, whereas you want to do NOTHING. 

We're an outlier in the world, and hence have more shootings. It's insane. Can't get rid of the second amendment, true. No one wants to do that except extremists. Extremists on the other end want to prevent any regulation, even those that NRA and conservatives support overwhelmingly. 

Greater security? Yes, let's have police and security guards everywhere -- much cheaper solution than regulations. Maybe even a police state? Much safer. Or just arm the teachers, the priests, and the kindergarteners. 

4 in 10 Americans own guns - highest in the world. 
Percent of homicides using guns - 60%. 
Roughly 300 million guns in America. 

The stats are staggering. Compare to the rest of the world and it's mind-boggling.

To answer the question about how we purchased the rifles/shotguns, we started by just fucking around and shooting at a local range.

And there's arguments to be had about whether the second amendment even gives citizens the right to own guns, if we're honest. Perhaps it should even be amended. 
Look at the UK gun crime and tell me what you think. There's simply no argument on your side any more, which is why things will change. Sure, it will still take some time, and traditionalists will resist, but you'll die out, the next generation will understand a little better, and the right argument will win out.

Most people who die from gun related deaths are suicides, but according to you it's because of 'gun culture' and not mental health issues.

"Just some facts that everyone can find on Google...

1) America has the most lax gun laws in the world. Assault weapons (like the one used in the Florida shooting) were banned from 1994 and 2004 and deaths from mass shootings went down. Republican-controlled Congress let the ban expire in 2004 and deaths from mass shootings shot straight up. In fact, 7 of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in America occurred after the assault weapons ban expired in 2004. The others occurred before the weapons ban took effect in 1994.

2)  Gun control works. For instance, Australia had a stream of mass shootings and in 1996 banned assault weapons (not all weapons) - they removed almost a million guns from circulation via a voluntary buyback program - and mass shootings ended immediately. They had zero mass shootings since, even though they do still have guns for hunting. But we can look inward at America: The states with mandatory background checks for gun purchases have half the number of mass shootings as other states. Gun control works and it doesn't mean anyone loses their right to bear arms.

3) The government isn't allowed to draw these conclusions because of lobbying by the National Rifle Association. The NRA poured hundreds of millions of dollars into successfully lobbying a Republican-controlled Congress to ban the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from researching gun violence. The CDC's job is to research why Americans die so we can prevent it, but Republicans in Congress threatened to shut the CDC down if it studied gun violence at the NRA's request. (Practically all of the NRA's money goes to Republicans.)

4) Armed guards and more guns haven't stopped these mass shootings. The most common argument you hear from pro-gun people is that there needed to be armed guards to stop the shootings, despite a track record of that not helping. The Florida school had armed police officers. In Las Vegas, the Mandalay Bay hotel had armed guards too. The problem is that assault weapons can fire about 300 rounds per minute - they are fast, easy, efficient machines designed to do one thing: kill people. In the Las Vegas shooting, he shot 851 people and killed 58 people in just 10 minutes of shooting.

5) Mental health is not the cause. Every country in the world has mental illness. The reason America has more shootings than any other country is that anyone, mentally ill or not, can easily access assault weapons with high-capacity guns. Mental health problems alone do not result in massacres - easy access to guns is a requirement. 

To claim that these mass shootings can be directly attributed to anything other than easy access to assault weapons is insanity. We need gun control now and we must put pressure on Congress. In November 2018, maybe don't vote for Republicans who have taken thousands of dollars from the NRA.",-0.9987,537

Since bump stocks do not change the mechanical nature of the weapon, they are not machine guns according to the ATF. But banning those is pointless as you can bump fire any semi auto weapon with little more than a belt loop. I personally believe we need better security for soft targets, and much harsher penalties for gun related crimes.

Australia passed strict gun ownership laws that go far beyond simple background checks, and installed heavy regulation over types of guns and reasons for requiring a gun (farmers, competitive shooting etc).

United States: 19 mass shootings in the first two months of 2018. Is that correct??!

From my limited knowledge of the topic, my understanding is that many US senators and congressman are in the pocket of a gun lobby. If that's the case, either such political funding has to be removed, or the president must use extraordinary powers to enforce a change or national vote in the interests of national security. That's the point it's at right now, obviously something different and possibly controversial has to happen for change.  

Yes it's written in the US constitution that everyone has the right to bare arms,  however that document was written in a different time and I'd like to think that globally, western society has progressed since such times as slavery. Sometimes people must have change forced on them, for the greater good of society as a whole. In my opinion the constitution's currently failing in its underlying function to protect its citizens. The system's also failing its citizens, and the framework in place to support the system only goes to support the failure, not the repair.

It's not really my place to comment or provide advice, I understand, however I find these school shootings extremely disturbing and am just trying to help.",-0.7155,359

This is a terrible shooting, but come on for fucks sake. You USA people allow your own troops to go in and massacre innocent women and children all so your few wealthy families can have some more oil and resources for themselves and you the peasant middle class American don't even get any of that either, other than cheap fuel for your dam car addiction. wow  And then when one cares to look, we all find that over 70% of all Americans are on some type of medication for emotional disorders now. Over 70% of the country high on drugs. WHAT THE FUCK - and at the same time you carry guns. holy shit, its like a sick as comedy. must be a joke. And on top of that, the government won't get rid of guns as that is a major financial crotch for your country, and the people won't put them down, as your troops, your police, are so bloody corrupt that the peasants cant go without weapons as then the only people left would be the medicated troops and medicated police, fuck that shit.

"Yo what's going on with the world, momma
Yo people living like they ain't got no mommas
I think they all distracted by the drama and
Attracted to the trauma, mamma

The meaning of karma
Overseas, yeah they trying to stop terrorism
Over here on the streets the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
But if you only got love for your own race
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind and just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate
To the love, so the whole world celebrate it
It just ain't the same, always in change
New days are strange, is the world insane?
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
Where's the love when a child gets murdered
Or a cop gets knocked down
Black lives not now
Everybody matter to me
All races, y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody
Guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protests with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart
Why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around
Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
And if you never speak truth then you never know how love sounds
And if you never know love then you never know God, wow
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
Can't we all just get along?

That's not necessarily true. As you can see in Australia, most guns were returned during amnesty periods and most that weren‚Äôt were reported by neighbors, traced by cops from common venders, etc..

Not to mention that, since mass murders are often premeditated around 1 year to 1 month before the occurrence, most possible future murderers would turn in their before they snap.
