"""Satellites help track hurricanes"" Small example of how satellites helped on the ground. I see you used Irma for that graphic. I too STARED at that path graphic for about 2 days. While most read it and said time to leave A couple friends and I used it to see where was going to be the worst hit. See we had filled our box truck with hundreds of pounds of supplies and more fuel than i care to remember (yea riding in the back of a full box truck with 36-5 gallon gas cans filled is not really enjoyable especially on a 20 hour drive lol) Those maps were extremely important to us in conjunction with news reports. We ended up going to the keys and being some of the first allowed down (they were turning everyone away except for us.....) So in short NASA helped us get much NEEDED supplies to people who were in DIRE need of the supplies we had to offer. Im not gonna sit here and say we saved lives alright i dont know if we did but what i do know is the local radio personalities were saying there were supplies at sugar loaf key school. There were not...at least until we got there. Now we may not have saved lives but gettin the young mom some food for her and her child, Gettin a man some dry socks so he can continue helping his neighbors or gettin food to an elderly gentleman who hadnt eaten in 2 days and could barely walk was worth the effort. Yes we helped clear road and even cleared a boy scout camp that was used as a base of operations for the military support efforts. Without NASA we may have gotten there too late to be of any meaningful use but because the resources provided by NASA we were in the hardest hit areas a mere HOURS after the storm instead of days. While I have the forum a special shout out to the Key West Police Department. They did a magnificent job givin the situation. They also were a bit confused when we first pulled up to the station and said hey we got all this water lets unload most of it to you guys so you can pass it out. Admittedly 1 off the coolest most gratifyingh assembly lines ive ever been in (it was something like 100 cases of water to unload lol). They allowed us to park in a lot along the water and even gave us honorary badges the night before we left (thats a hilarious story for another time lol). So yea to KWPD thank you and hope to see you folks under better conditions soon.",0.9944,486

The issue is money itself. Money is an idea of controlling the human masses. Fractional reserve money does not exist because you'll find those promissory tokens are not written against a physical object (precious materials).

NASA has a tendency to innovate new ideas and inventions and alot of the time its got a very real practical use for here at home not just in space exploration. Advancement in both tech and discovery leads to a much better quality of life for us. examples include (but not limited to) super computers, MRE's, robotics etc... NASA is important for so many reasons, dont get me wrong spaceX is AWESOME and Elon Musk is a god damn hero....a living legend really but that does not replace ALL that NASA does.
