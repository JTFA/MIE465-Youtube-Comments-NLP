Both teams suck. I thought the giant's was going to be a playoff team this year because of last year. Giants had 11 wins and 5 loss in the regular season. And now the giants suck giants record now is 1 win and 8 loss nope the giants no longer a playoff team even they win 8 games in a row still no playoff team 8 and 8 no giants trash even the 49ers are better. But if the giants play Cleveland then I would say the giants would win. But I'm a viking fan and I'm glad I'm not a 49er fan or a giants fan their both are trash and both of them are ass.,0.9641,123
