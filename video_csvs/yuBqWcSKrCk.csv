"Cardio needs to be part of your  everyday life style to live a healthy life.  One easy way  to introduce cardio is to ride a bicycle.   Riding a bike is fun and good exercise plus you save money on transportation.  Walking, bicycles, mass transit and electric vehicles will all be part of making cities livable.     Ride to school.   Ride to work.   Ride for fun.
Bike to work day should be everyday..  Employers need to provide places to park and lock bicycles and encourage employees to ride a bicycle to work. Children should be riding a bike to school instead of being dropped off by their parents. Cities need to do more to provide safe walking and biking trails and paths that connect homes, schools and businesses. Speak up and ask for more bicycle paths in your community. Obesity is a growing problem around the world leading to an increase in heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. Walking and biking can help improve health. Buy a child a bicycle.  Your son, daughter, niece, nephew, grandchild or donate one to a local charity as a fund raiser giveaway. You will change a life.",0.9773,217

"OK I love Ellen, I really do .. but credit where credit is due...  look up Markiplier meow.. 2 years ago he was doing this, and it's a lot funnier =) .. not saying this isn't funny.. but it comes off as if this was an original Ellen show idea kind of irked me.. 

And .. disclaimer.. I'm not even a Markiplier fan anymore.. but he did do it first, a lot more effort went into it, he did a dog version which wasn't as popular.. and I think he did a second meow video .. 

Key differences though.. 

1. His isn't PG
2. His is his own voice, there's something funny about using owen's wow that gives it a boost.. for sure.. 
3. He invested a lot of time ( or paid someone to ) editing his mouth onto the cats which is what made me laugh most.
4. He's not Ellen.. 

=)

Enjoy them both, I doubt Ellen knew about Mark, and perhaps someone did it before Mark.. but it annoys me when a big time syndicated show takes credit or doesn't give credit at least .. someone on the writing staff OBVIOUSLY knew about this and decided it would b e fun to implement it.",0.99,233
