The dupes look better I think,0.4404,6
"The matte shades lasts pretty well (but won't hold up against greasy food like pizza). The ColourPop lip liner all over the lips is definitely the most long-wearing. The creamier shades aren't long-lasting so you'll have to reapply! Thanks for watching, Nicole!",0.9183,49
"The vital thing to me is how long-lasting makeup is.  I always look for 8, 12, 24-hour stay power in lipstick.  I think this is the important fact to mention when reviewing makeup--especially lipstick. :-)",0.6486,42
