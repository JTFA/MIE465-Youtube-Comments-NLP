"I agree and disagree. Nolan has in way done somethings revolutionary.... I feel as though Nolan gave us a modern type of silent film. Instead of black and white, gave us color, instead of no speech with subtitles, gave us minimal dialogue ( just to give some people a sense of what is happening) with an extraordinary score that goes along with epic visuals, providing that intense factor. Films have come so far that an ""old-style silent film"" won't have much effect or impact on us or give us that intense 'wow' factor. But Nolan did strip many of what most films do nowadays, which is focus on dialogue and an in-depth complex plot. Like Stories of Old youtube channel, gave use an example of how Dunkirk film could have been maybe. Although it was greatly done Nolan does what Nolan does best and that is provide epic intense visual scenes with amazing story ( although Dunkirk was an epic intense visual film minus the amazing storyline) provided the best of the best Hans Zimmer scores.",0.9738,196

I remember noting how many scenes went without dialogue for a while.  Nolan really let the cinematography speak for itself (in both the scenery and the actors' faces).

This was a great idea, and I'm happy it was done expertly.  My only hope is that it finds its way to Christopher Nolan so he can see this passion project.",0.9766,105

"Nimrod is also, of course, another word for moloch the Babylonian luciferic ‚Äúgod‚Äù to the war machine

Go back to the source. In Babylon around 4-5,000 years ago it was Phoenician controlled. All the public were conditioned to worship a trinity of nimrod/ baal/ bel, semiramis/ virgin queen connected to owls and tammuz (a reincarnation of nimrod) / later called Jesus in the christian stories. In Egypt this was similar characters called Isis, Horus and Osiris. The story was a battle was between the dark Set and the light Osiris/ nimrod. So as these rich bullion dealer bloodlines moved through Rome the names changed from semiramis and tamus to Horus and Isis to Mary and Jesus . The dove and the sun. The torch is nimrod on the Statue of Liberty. Dagon the fish god is also apparently a representation of nimrod. Nimrod became Osiris.

"This is a special project of mine unlike anything I‚Äôve ever done before. What started off as a regular essay on Dunkirk‚Äôs visual storytelling and its influences from silent films, slowly turned into what is by far my most experimental video to date. It began when I re-edited a few clips from Dunkirk into a silent film style to compare it to existing silent films that Nolan mentioned as his inspirations (and also; because it was just really fun to do). I was amazed at how well it translated and how well it highlighted Nolan‚Äôs use of camera angles, body language, facial expressions and staging in Dunkirk‚Äôs storytelling; a great use of visuals both in portraying minor conflicts as well as in telling the story as a whole. This last point presented an interesting challenge for my video essay, because translating individual scenes into silent ones is relatively easy; I think there are many recent films that have scenes with strong visual storytelling, but I can‚Äôt think of many films that can be turned into a silent film in their entirety and still work. Dunkirk however, I believe, is one of those films. For a second I considered re-editing the entire film, but because that would obviously lead to copyright issues I decided to transform it into a short that showcases Dunkirk‚Äôs strength in visual storytelling in both the small details as well as the story as a whole. I tried as much as possible to maintain the essence of Dunkirk, but I also wanted it to stand on its own which meant I had to pay a lot of attention to its internal logic and do some creative editing. 

Anyways, I figured this would be a great and fitting way to end the first year of Like Stories of Old. I started this channel a couple of months ago, mostly worrying about whether or not anyone is going to respond to my voice, my ideas and my desire to approach topics with sincerity. Now, over 35.000 subscribers, more than a 100 Patrons and almost a million total views later, I feel only gratitude, and confidence that 2018 will be even greater!

It also never looks like there's actually an army of 400k people on that beach.",-0.4491,67
