"He doesn't need eyes to destroy a toy ... just good teeth (teeth that might be damaged by chewing undesirable items). There are some things, that you might want to think about. Chewing that toy might not be good for his teeth, nor his gums, and he might swallow small parts, all things that your watching over him (during the process of him chewing the toy apart) will not prevent. Another thing, that I don't understand is that you are allowing and encouraging him to have destructive behavior. What is going to happen is, he is going to chew up something that means a LOT to one of you, and you will get very upset and wonder why he did that. Remember, he cannot see to discriminate what, exactly, he is chewing apart. I am not trying to be critical. I have rescued all kinds of dogs (including dachshunds) for decades, many of them turned into pounds or dumped, because of undesirable behavior. I just don't think, that you are doing this dog any favors by allowing/encouraging/liking this destructive behavior. You might think that it is a cute game, while trying to get people interested in watching more of this how-long-will-it-take-to-chew-up-a-toy game on Instagram, but I don't think that people are going to share your enthusiasm for this dog's activity, and, in the end, you are going to be left with a destructive dog, chewing up your valued possessions. When this happens, the dog will not understand why he is being scolded for chewing up one item, when you thought it was cute when he chewed up this toy. Also, WHY would you want your dog chewing up his toys? I, also, noticed that when you got your hand in ""the mix"" that you had to avoid being bit. He was snapping at your hand, another behavior that should not be allowed. What if that was a child's hand or a smaller pet (which dachshunds have a tendancy to not be good with, and will kill). It is NOT cute to allow these behaviors. Dachshunds are tough little dogs, with or without good eyesight. He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, just because he is a blind senior dog. I am only saying all of this, from an objective perspective, not to be critical, but to be helpful, because I might be able to see things, that you haven't noticed or thought of, yet.",0.9746,472
