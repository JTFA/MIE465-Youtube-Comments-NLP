I can see being angry at kneeling during the national anthem, if the protest has nothing to do with you... but winning the gold, and him trying to represent his country by holding it up in the air and then wrapping himself up with it... and it accidentally touches the ground... Lets be realistic please. If you seriously think he did that intentionally, you are something else. He just won, and I doubt he had any idea the flag touched the ground. He didn't lay it on the ground and step on it... get a grip. IF YOU CARE ABOUT AMERICA, YOU WOULD CARE ABOUT MASS SHOOTINGS, POOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND FACILITIES, CORRUPT POLICE OFFICERS/POLICE BRUTALITY, OUR CORRUPT JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND RACISM.
