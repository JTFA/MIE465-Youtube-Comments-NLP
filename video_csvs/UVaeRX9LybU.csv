"I just wanted to share my story with you Ellie and Jared.I have 3 older children and wanted to try for our 4th. We never struggled to get pregnant before so when we tried, we were confused as to why it wasn't happening. So we started to track and finally got pregnant.but lost our baby in August 2015. We were heartbroken but were overjoyed when we found out we were expecting again but lost that baby in October 2015 which resulted in having a DNC do to excessive blood loss. So our stories are somewhat similar. This changed every aspect of who I was as a woman, wife, sister, aunt, mother, ect. We had a loss in 2006 as well and these last two were the ones that made me become a different person. We got pregnant a 7th time and had such mixed feelings. We wanted to be so happy and share it with the world but were the most scared we have ever been. Once we heard the heart beat, it did help but not that much. Until we had our 2nd rainbow baby in our arms, we could finally relax. I pray for you and your entire family that everything works out and I KNOW you will get your rainbow baby!! God bless",0.9658,239
