"Was it Cuomo who had the conversation with the Roy Jones defender about swearing on the Christian bible? That's seriously the funniest clip. That guy is also a gigantic moron. The further right they lean, the lower on the intelligence scale these guys seem to be.

"Where do they get these Republicans ? A Republican Pat Meehan said he sexually harassed one of his aides because of Obama care, also the one in Texas Blake Farenthold settled a sexual harassment claim with his former communications director. All of these were settled with TAX payers money. This guy comes on and sounds like he is Alex Jones. I can remember not so long ago the Republicans claimed to be the party of family values and personal responsibility.",0.4767,85

"Why are Republicans more concerned with covering up Trumps treasonous actions then addressing Russian interference on our Democracy. Their lack of action and concern speaks of their loyalty to this country, none. maybe they tasted a little Russian money themselves. Their was a time when foreign interference would have outraged us all. When you try to derail a legitimate and Nationally important investigation concerning treasonous actions your defending the wicked. Your defending Russia.Maybe Matt should move to Russia so he's closer to his friends. I have 4 honorable discharges, served during Dessert Storm and the invasion of Iraq. Has Matt ever served? Easy to betray your country when you've never learned about honor and integrity . Is Gaetz a Russian name?",-0.8621,132

"this was the cream on the cake of what was yet another partisan disgraceful performance by Cuomo.  ""Since the immaculate conception"" is a phrase which means ""in a very long time"".  I can only assume the congressman failed to get that out because he was still coming to terms with the train wreck of a display Cuomo had been putting on up to this point.  Cuomo trying to get some cheap points out of a common expression (and unfortunately succeeding) which has a religious reference says a lot about the man.",-0.8225,101

“The Holy Spirit did not go into such detail about the Pharisees in the New Testament just so we could understand a group unique to the first century.
