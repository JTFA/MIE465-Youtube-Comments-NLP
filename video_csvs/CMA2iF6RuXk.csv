"Remember the episode where Phoebe has a cold and is singing “Smelly Cat” or was it “My sticky shoes” or something in that so called “Sexy Voice”. This is how Fergie sounds here except Phoebe might have won the battle of the voices on this one. She hits that so called high note and all I can picture is nothing but dogs howling Wha-Hooooooo!!!!!!! Get F of Here!!! She needs to get back “Sipping Champagne and living the Fabulous life” People should stop trying to be the next Marvin Gaye and singing the Star Spangled Banner to the next level. There is no next level to our national anthem except either you can hang with the song vocally or not. By the way, Whitney Houston didn’t do a different arrangement of the song Ms. WH vocals were so powerful that she was able to do the song .....unlike many JUSTICE!!!!! Plain and simple....stop playing on here and if U can’t handle a lyrically challenged song than don’t do it.",0.901,202
