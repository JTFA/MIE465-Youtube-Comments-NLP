It hasn't even been 2 yrs since Harry met Meghan and most of their time was spent in a long distance relationship. Living with someone for years is different from spending few weeks with them especially when it comes to members of the royal family whose daily lives are dictated by protocol and media interest.

Meghan is a ghetto gold-digging American whore who is also a divorcee. This whole thing is a well-planned scam. She couldn't care less about Prince Harry or his family.

She is older than Harry and when someone watches her with open eyes and an open brain it is so crystal clear that she is acting a role. She is so fake! She is not genuine and insincere. Meghan has no class, no poise and no posture. She is not graceful and she is dog shit ugly! I hope Harry gets some brains before marrying this abomination. Mark my words, after the wedding she will empty Harry's bank accounts and bugger off back to her ghetto land. She and her family are going to raid the royal jewels, money and assets like a committee of hungry vultures. Meghan is the biggest scammer in the world. She is nothing but a cheap whore who is craving for money!!! I hope this almost 40-year-old woman can't reproduce with Harry. These disgusting black inbreds are all the same.

"Its not about being down to earth. Everyone who has met William has said that hes incredibly friendly and down to earth. Hes well known to go around in events letting fans and the public take selfies with him and even sometimes offering to take the selfie himself since hes taller. Go watch his BBC radio interview with Kate and see how humble and hilarious he can be. The reason he appears more reserved is because hes the future King and is being held to a standard. He cant fool around too much in public especially when hes sitting there doing an interview that will probably stay in history archives till the end of time. Harry is more of a celebrity at this point in time than a real contender for the throne so he has far more room to mess up and fool around. I personally didnt find anything stiff about him especially in this interview. He was calm, confident and dignified. Plus, Kate was sweet, appeared calm and had good teamwork with William. Harry and Meghan's interview may seem bubbly but you cant deny how many times she would interrupt him and how pushy she sounded. Having said that, I hope this is only because of how excited she was rather than it being her typical personality and I hope Harry is happy with his choice.",0.9788,244
"Jen Perreault  why do you think that? Maybe I'm missing something? I think their a very good match! I remember when Harry's parents got married it was yes beautiful fairytale! I'm Diana's age my attitude was Charles is an old soul marrying a girl that knows nothing about life! Diana's wasn't given the opportunity mature she wasn't ready! I wasn't ready! I thought Sarah n Andrew were to immature Fergie for sure! But our generation believed in knights in shining armor! William n Harry are much more mature than their parents were! It's obvious they looked at all the mess up marriages and realized no one would pick their wives. Charles would be supportive; he looks so damn miserable at he's wedding! Everybody calls William n Kate boring; he's the older n has to be the example! I say try not to predict negativity on these two people. Give them a chance at less. Divorce, biracial, older, actress educated and very articulate doesn't= failure! I personally think are right for each other! A man like Harry isn't stupid! Maybe people were expected to hear 👂 and see 👀 the stereotypical woman of color! Instead Meghan is relaxed, refined which makes one uncomfortable! Don't get me wrong she isn't a push over. She's got a very strong backbone, we woman of color must have a backbone. We rely on no one to define us!

"Will and Kate were engaged for a lot longer than Harry and Meghan so that could explain why they appeared ""calmer"" during the interview. Plus, they dated and lived together for many years so I get the feeling that they had reached the level of emotional stability and security long time before their marriage was even announced. Harry and Meghan are on this whirlwind romance that hasn't settled yet and frankly this is what I would consider worrying about this couple. I just hope that once they come down from their ""high"", they will still wish to remain together.",0.9282,109
"William & Kate engagement announcement was stiff, formal and awkward to watch !  William is like father Charles, so prim proper royal protocol by the book, he's a stiff shirt and Kate appeared really fake.
Harry & Meghan engagement announcement was a pleasure to watch.  Two people so clearly in love, glancing at each other lovingly and so relaxed; although Harry appeared a bit nervous at first. Understandably  so.   Diana, Princess of Wales would of loved loved Meghan Markle !",0.985,90

Don't even think of denying it. It has been PROVEN from the DNA of mummies. You can look at the mummies and still see the blonde and red hair too. So you really need to follow your own advice and do some research... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rZpPXQBUjI 

You should actually thank me too. 

Ok, moving on, the second point I'd like to make is: stop calling me stupid when I am OWNING you over and over again in this debate. You keep losing and making snide remarks, but I am winning. 

I haven't insulted you once. 

Thirdly, IQ is just one of hundreds of genetic racial differences that exist. So no, this is not just about IQ.",0.8711,159
