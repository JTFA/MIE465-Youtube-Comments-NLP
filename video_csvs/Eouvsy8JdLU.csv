"Actually the focal point is the focal plane but for one single point. For an image, the light converges down to only a miniature size of the image. You cannot focus an image down to a point. The focal point for a point or an image is the same. The focal plane, image plane, sensor plane are all locations where the image is in focus and they all contain the focal point.",0.0,80

"Also for fun finger experiments - Feynman (yes him) in one of his lectures mentioned that if you find a bright point source, like the reflection of the sun of a chrome bumper or something, you can observe diffraction by just using your fingers. You have to hold your fingers relatively close to your face and close one eye - keeping your fingers in focus - and push your fingers closer and closer in on either side of the point source eventually the light will spread and you may see rainbows. Additionally I tried this when I was under a sodium vapor lamp and got a nice stripe pattern since the light was monochromatic. It's tough to do though doesn't always work (very important it's a point source), also capturing on camera might be really hard.",0.8781,147
"As a kid in school (before I got glasses) I figured out a trick that helped me read the board if I needed to when I was sat towards the back of the class. I accidentally did it the first time by rubbing my eye while squinting at the board and all of a sudden the words became crystal clear. Basically it worked by pressing on the skin at the crease of my eye and moving it towards my ear (essentially forcing that one eye to squint). This gave me crystal clear vision, if I found the perfect spot, for the time that I held it like that. 

I've wondered for years what kind of witchcraft I was practicing back then. Please help explain this.",0.93,137

"Diffraction is so far fetched in this topic because diffraction needs a material with a different refraction index to cause diffraction.  As you are staying in air, there is no reason for diffraction. Btw you can observe the same effect when you look on the shadow of your fingers of a point like light source, like the sun. When you bring your finger closer and closer together the shadow suddenly closes the gap between your fingers although they are not touching yet. And as an addition to you explanation in the video. You dont see the ball on a different location more blurred. You see less of it, that is the reason why the image is smaller. And therefore you think its more focussed, but actually it is just smaller but blurred the same way. Please excuse my english, I am not native :D",-0.0172,157

"Here's a TOUGH one. I hope you create a video or atleast reply to it with ur comments (cause vid maybe difficult). Other comments are also welcome.

Now, E= (MC) squared. Which means mass is turned into energy. What if Energy is just mass, but so minute tht it can't be measured (optional: cause it's travelling and directly proportionate to mass)? What if light has weight and it's own mass and cudn't be measured as yet? What if the mass of travelling objects is different,  cause of 'C' in the equation. 

This could possibly rewrite what we think of energy and in whole physics if it can be looked into. The inspiration comes from Newton's corpuscular theory which also explains why light can't escape a black hole and bends across high mass objects.",0.896,156
