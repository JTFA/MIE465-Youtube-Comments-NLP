I heard all year how you had the best D line ever and mayfield made you look silly and I believe you only got one sack yesterday against our patchwork line. Total underachievers. You beat us. You've done that a lot so I can swallow my pride. But I'm just saying we've seen Harbaugh bring a better prepared team to the game these past couple years compared to Meyer. If your biased Ohio refs know how to spot a ball we would've won last year.
