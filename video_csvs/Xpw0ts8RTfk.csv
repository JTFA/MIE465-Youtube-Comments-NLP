The violent black James Bond (played by Samuel L. Jackson) with the badass bond girl who double crosses him (played by Uma Thurman) and the villain would be Tim Roth, the movie won't follow a lineal time and it'll be extremely violent and funny.
(Quentin Tarantino's James Bond).

Leo DiCaprio is a drug addict MI6 agent who is telling is memoirs to the audience in this 3 hour Martin Scorsese's James Bond movie, with Robert DeNiro as the villain.

Simon Pegg fights Nick Frost in this James Bond comedy by Edgar Wright.

Johnny Depp plays a PTSD crazy James Bond, and Helena Boham Carter plays his crazy bond girl, they fight against Micheal Keaton, in this horror James Bond by Tim Burton.

James Bond is played by Bruce Willis in the Shyamaland version (it ends when he discovers the villain is vulnerable to water).

The Rock is James Bond and Megan Fox is the bond girl In this Sci-fi explosion porn version by Michael Bay.

And there's room for much more! I feel like the spy movies should mix and match with other genres to keep it fresh (like marvel is trying to do).

Any film or TV series that is of cinematic/historical merit, or that is in a sense, ""classic"", Tarantino has usually expressed a great love for that work.. That said, I think all members of the panel here, seem to see Tarantino's take on doing this project as almost 'whimsical', and if that were the case, I don't think that the idea of this happening would be nearly as impressive, nor exciting.

"I'm a fan of Star Trek, I grew up watching Next Gen and have loved this first chapter of Discovery and I'm also a massive Tarantino fan but this feels like something that.s theatrically amazing but in practice a terrible idea. There are certain directors where you know you just know what a movie of there's is and thus forcing them to work within any sort of framework will be detrimental to their art and also detrimental to the mythology of the pre existing property. I would like to clarify I'm not saying these sort of directors can't adapt source material as Tarantino himself has done that with Jackie Brown. But They are normally they one the ones first adapting it or at least the first in the new series for that source material, (Nolan with the Dark Knight Trilogy). In this instance it appears that Tarantino would be making the official 4th movie in the current series, whilst you could point to marvel and argue they've had directors of real vision come in and work wonders the movies that they've made have still felt like ""Marvel"" movies within the universe that they've created and I just can't imagine Tarantino creating something that could feel like a Star Trek movie and a Tarantino movie that fits in both universes. Also if the movie is a continuation it would feel weird for Tarantino to have a movie that requires the context of other movies to be watched and understood, as every Tarantino movie today has been its own origin if you will",0.9708,276

"Robbins v. Lower Merion School District  -- School distributed laptops to students with surveillance software (supposedly for anti-theft purposes), then turned on the software (even though the laptops were not missing) remotely collecting snapshots of students at home without their knowledge or consent. They took millions of photos like a photo every minute, or every X-number of seconds, and sent back to school's IT staff over the internet who did not bother to turn off the software or track and control who had access to the surveillance photos being collected. They probably collected thousands of photos of these children naked or changing clothes in their rooms or in the bathroom if they took the laptop into their bathroom.",0.5,130

"The three episodes of ""Star Trek:  The Original Series"" that might be interesting for Quentin Tarantino type of film might be interesting to see expanded on in a new ""Star Trek"" film would be either season 2's ""A Piece of the Action"", or season 2's ""By Any Other Name"" or season 3's ""Day of the Dove"".  Let me take all of those on why they would be an interesting episode from the original series for a Tarantino-Abrams film to re-explore and an expand on:  1.  ""A Piece of the Action"" putting  the crew back into a planet that was influenced by events that happened in the 1920's Prohibition era in Chicago, would be fascinating and something Tarantino could work with very well.  2.  ""By Any Other Name"" was a great episode, that got sort of short changed in its final execution, especially with the intergalactic invaders into our galaxy of the Kelvans.  Also the concept of the Kelvans turning the humans into those 'blocks"" (actually porous cuboctahedrons -- you'll have to look that up via google or yahoo) made up the persons base minerals where it the person's essence (and of course in that episode you have the only death in the series of red shirt, or in her case red dress crewperson while in that form -- crushed to death), could be something with Tarantino on board to expand it, might be something very interesting to watch.  And season 3's ""Day of the Dove"" where the Enterprise is invaded by the cloud that caused everyone to start hating each other, and giving them false memories to do so, while the Klingons were also on board, sounds like also a type of film from Tarantino (although that episode was basically a 'bottle show', meaning it took place for the good part of the episode, except near the very beginning on board the ship -- which might be difficult translate into a full movie version of that episode, but it isn't a bad or awful possibility of being a larger film in the Tarantino type of way.)   Just my two cents about this news.",0.9561,415
