"I actually can tell whenever I'm making people uncomfortable, but I get so nervous I can't stop talking. It's scary when you realize that the other person doesn't find your story funny or interesting, you feel like there is this huge spotlight on your head. Then you have to stop the conversation because you feel so bad, but you can't just stop talking mid sentence. At this point, you are so panic-striken, that you don't have any coherent thought in your head, so your story turn into a utter nonsense and that makes it harder to try to figure out a way to end your story in way that is quick and neat.

After 10 minutes of word salad my friend is trying to give me an out. Like that he's late or he's gotta run. I am relieved. I respond by saying how I should skedaddle too, because <blank>. That turns into a story about all the things I was planning to do that day. I realized I started talking again and I can't stop. I don't even know what my mouth is doing, I just keep thinking ""Why can't I stop?!"". Finally I just scream ""OKAY YEAH I GOTTA GO"", run home and don't talk anyone for days.
