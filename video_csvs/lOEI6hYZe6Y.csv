Universität Wien Study: Muslim Migrants Have Medieval Attitudes Towards Jews, Gays, Women, and ‘Infidels’
muslim
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/01/18/study-muslim-migrants-medieval-attitudes-jews-gays-women-infidels/

by Jack Montgomery              18 Jan 2018

An academic survey of asylum seekers in Graz, Austria, has found increasing religiosity and deeply worrying attitudes towards Jews, gay people, women, and ‘infidels’.

The study was carried out by Ednan Aslan, Professor of Islamic Religious Education at the University of Vienna (Universitätsring 1 | 1010 Vienna | T +43-1-4277-0), on behalf of local authorities responsible for integration, the Kurier reports.

“We wanted to know, who lives with us?” explained Kurt Hohensinner, a city councillor for the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), which currently governs alongside the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ).

Professor Aslan interviewed a sample of 288 of the approximately 4,000 predominantly Afghan asylum seekers in state care in Graz, and discovered that some 54.5% believe Jewish people do not care about anyone but themselves, with 44.2% saying that Judaism is actively harmful to the world.

“For certain refugees anti-Semitism is a matter of course, which has given the refugee movement a new dimension,” Professor Aslan observed.

    — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 17, 2017

More than half – 51.7%– of migrants said they regarded homosexuality as immoral, with 59% voicing opposition to same-sex marriage.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were young men under 30, and Professor Aslan found attitudes which would be considered decidedly misogynistic by Western standards: 44.2% said they would support the use of violence against wives who were disloyal to their husbands.

However, the Muslim women Professor Aslan surveyed appeared no less prone to extremism than their male counterparts, with 62% saying they attached great importance to wearing the Islamic headscarf in public, and 44.3% saying they would refuse to shake hands with a man.

    — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 12, 2017

Perhaps most striking was a finding that almost half of the migrants surveyed — 49.8% — said Islam played a bigger role in their lives in Austria than it had in their native countries.

“Mosques have a certain influence on these people,” observed Professor Aslan, with 70% saying they attended prayers every Friday, and 55% saying they believed unbelievers would burn in Hell.

Breitbart London has previously reported concerns that Graz’s mosques have already turned the city into a “stronghold” of radical Islam, with experts saying that 11 out of 20 are under constant surveillance for extremist links.

    — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 21, 2016

It is possible that hardline attitudes may be even more prevalent than Professor Aslan’s study suggests, too, with European Union Counter-Terrorism Co-ordinator Gilles de Kerchove noting that “most fanatics disguise their convictions [through] increasing use of taqiyya” after the Barcelona terror attacks.

Taqiyya is a form religiously-sanctioned deception which allows Muslims to lie about their beliefs in the service of a greater cause or to avoid “persecution”, without the threat of punishment in the afterlife.

Indeed, a Bosnian migrant who ran down and killed four people in Graz in 2015, including a small child, was found to have lied about being a Christian, when he was really a devout Muslim who attended mosque six times a week.

"As no-go zones riot, the next Dutch government could be more leftist
http://freewestmedia.com/2017/04/14/as-no-go-zones-riot-the-next-dutch-government-could-be-more-leftist/
The Netherlands is a country where the Muslim community shows few signs of integration. There are now forty no-go zones, in which constant rioting take place, most recently in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Nijmegen and Veldhoven.
Published: April 14, 2017, 10:18 am

The government has released the list of 40 “no-go” zones, mostly Islamic.

The Kolenkit area in Amsterdam is the number one Muslim “problem district” in the country. The next three districts are in Rotterdam – Pendrecht, het Oude Noorden and Bloemhof. The Ondiep district in Utrecht is in the fifth position, followed by Rivierenwijk (Deventer), Spangen (Rotterdam), Oude Westen (Rotterdam), Heechterp/ Schieringen (Leeuwarden) and Noord-Oost (Maastricht).

Veldhoven riot

The Dutch police had to break up an illegal and violent religious protest this weekend by Etritreans in Veldhoven.

The Dutch public broadcaster NOS television reported that the Netherlands has become one of the major European suppliers of Islamic jihadists. According to NOS, about 100 Dutch Muslims are active as jihadists in Syria, and most have joined the notorious Jabhat al-Nusra group.

According to the Hungarian government there are 900 areas across the EU where “the norms of the host society barely prevail” due to increased levels of migration.

The French government has listed 750 areas determined to be “Sensitive Urban Zones (Zones Urbaine Sensibles, or ZUS).” ZUS areas tend to have high crime, low unemployment, and drug trafficking/black market issues.

Germany’s Steinke Institut (SI) has mapped 51 separate areas which have been explained as “law-free” and with “high danger potential”. In 2011 Chief Police Commissioner Bernhard Witthaut, in an August 1 interview with the newspaper Der Westen, revealed that Muslim immigrants are imposing “no-go” zones in cities across Germany at an alarming rate.

Some regions in Russia are known as hotbeds for radical Islam, including Chechnya and Dagestan, which are “virtual no-go zone” for Russians and tourists.

In Italy, Muslims have been commandeering the Piazza Venezia in Rome for public prayers, and in Bologna, Muslims repeatedly have threatened to bomb the San Petronio cathedral because it contains a 600-year-old fresco inspired by Dante’s Inferno which depicts Mohammed being tormented in hell.

In 2014, 2015 and 2016, Islamists demonstrated and shouted slogans in support of the Islamic State. One area of The Hague, known locally as “the Sharia triangle”, is being run by a form of unofficial Sharia police.

Meanwhile Dutch AFA (“anti-fascist”) socialists use every opportunity to create riots, and they team up with radical Islamists to do so.

In the district of Schilderswijk, about two kilometres from The Hague’s city centre, an almost entirely Muslim population of some 5 000 residents surrounds the El Islam mosque. Dutch-born citizens are repeatedly attacked by foreigners in these zones. The perpetrators are often so sure of their impunity that they publish online videos of their crimes.

But local police chief Michel de Roos told the Irish Times in 2013: “We have no indications there is a form of Sharia police here. That is not to say it does not happen, but we are unaware of it.”

Non-Muslim residents often say they feel harassed even in taking care of their pets. In Islam dogs are considered haram (impure), and dog owners are asked to keep their pets indoors.

The percentage of Muslims jailed for various crimes is notably higher than the percentage of Muslims in the population. Six percent of the country’s population are Muslim, but some 20% of all inmates are Muslim.

The Washington Post, 29 April 2008, reported, ironically that research by the George Soros Open Society Institute, an advocacy group for open borders, shows that in the Netherlands 20% of adult prisoners and 26% of all juvenile offenders are Muslim, while the country is about 5.5% Muslim.

Labour (PvdA) leader Diederik Samsom said in September 2011 in NRC Handelsblad that Moroccans have acquired “an ethnic monopoly” of certain forms of crime.

According to the local Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool, young Moroccans continue their “unstoppable march to become the largest group of violent criminals” in the country, despite decades of government programs aimed at steering young Muslims away from a life of crime.

Research done in 2014, found that more than 1,200 youth gangs are active in the Netherlands, and about 300 of these gangs are extremely violent. The Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice, who ordered the report, said the gangs were Moroccan youths.

The researchers suggest that one in five members of the investigated violent gangs were retarded or even slightly mentally disabled. They had an average IQ of between 70 and 85. In this study, the criminologists believe many have an IQ below 75.

But while the culture clash continues, the VNL, a conservative party established by two former Party for Freedom members, was beaten so severely during the past elections, that it will have no seat at all. Only Geert Wilders’ PVV have aquired slightly more seats.

Wilders was charged and found guilty of “hate speech” because he had singled out Moroccans as group prone to criminal behaviour.

A candidate of the Dutch party Forum voor Democractie (FVD), has been attacked while campaigning in Amsterdam.

The 71-year-old man is a candidate for the local elections in Amsterdam in March 2018. The man was handing out leaflets, when several activists assaulted him. They shouted “Not then, not now, never fascism again”, a famous Antifa slogan in the Netherlands.

The activists tried to remove the elderly man from a square and make him stop campaigning. After bystanders intervened, the activists disappeared. According to Dutch media the incident lasted at least 5 minutes.

"Europe's Hate-America Brigade   Back in business.
January 26, 2017     Bruce Bawer 
https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265555/europes-hate-america-brigade-bruce-bawer

They're back.

One of the pleasant things about the very best Dutch cafés is that most of them subscribe to a dozen or more newspapers from all over western Europe. It was thanks to this amenity that I became aware, soon after moving to Amsterdam from New York in the late 1990s, of the European media's poisonous hatred for the United States. In the eyes of almost all European journalists, I discovered, America was a land of illiterates, cretins, racists, xenophobes, warmongers.

And that was under Bill Clinton. It got even worse under George W. Bush. To be sure, on the day after 9/11 a few editorialists took  the “We Are All Americans” line, but others enjoyed the opportunity to spit at the victims of Ground Zero, declaring that America had asked for it. Swedish author Jan Guillou cheered the strike on “U.S. imperialism.” Norwegian author Gert Nygårdshaug sneered at somebody's concern that the next target might be in Europe: Muslims, he explained, hate Americans, and with good reason; for Europeans, however, they had nothing but goodwill.

The Afghanistan war further intensified the European media's anti-Americanism; and the Iraq war took it up yet another notch. Newspapers all over the continent accused Bush of terrorism, equated him with Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein (or said he was worse than either of them), derided him as a puppet of Israel, depicted Guantánamo as the ninth circle of hell, and called for an end to the Atlantic alliance. “It is not easy to know whom one should believe in this world of Bushmen and Saddamists,” wrote an editor at Norway's Dagsavisen, “where the truth is for sale and friends can hardly be distinguished from enemies.”

Then, one day, the anti-Americanism almost completely vanished from the European media. The date: November 4, 2008. Americans elected Barack Obama president, and suddenly America wasn't so terrible after all.

Part of the reason for the shift was, quite simply, shock. For a long time, a core belief of the European media had been that the overwhelming majority of white Americans were racist cavemen. How to make sense of the fact that millions of them had voted to put a black man in the White House? European journalists couldn't make sense of it.

But they knew one thing: they loved Obama. They had to love Obama. And they had to love him even more than Americans did – even more, indeed, than American journalists did. Because if they didn't, they'd be the racists. (Of course, the fact that they thought this way made one thing crystal clear: they were racists, the whole lot of them.)

In any event, for eight years, the presence of a black man in the Oval Office not only made it impossible for the European media to criticize him; it made them hesitate to go after America itself, at least in the take-no-prisoners way they'd been accustomed to. Guantánamo remained open, and Obama's policies helped make the Middle East even more destabilized and dangerous and led to the creation of ISIS. But you'd hardly have known it if you read the European press.

It must have hurt, having their hands tied like that for so long.

Well, now their hands are untied, and – with a few scattered exceptions – they're making up for lost time with a vengeance. As much as they loved Obama – well, that's how much they hate Trump. Most of them hate him even more, and clobber him even more brutally, than the majority of the American media do. No, maybe that's not possible. But they sure do hate him. One reason, surely, is that they know that Trump's victory has helped boost the prospects of Geert Wilders, Marine Le Pen, and others who – riding on waves of unease about the EU and Islam – seek to replicate the Donald's triumph in their own countries.

So it was that, on January 21, a writer for Spain's El Mundo compared Trump to Chance, the retarded gardener in the 1979 movie Being There who becomes a top White House adviser; over at that country's other big paper, El País, a commentator called his inauguration an “exhibition of male, white, privileged power.” While one piece in Denmark's Politiken was headlined “Obama was a magnificent president,”another spoke darkly of “TrumPutinism.” Sweden's Dagens Nyheter contrasted Trump, “the wicked troll,” with Justin Trudeau, the “fairy-tale prince.”

A Le Monde editorial snickered that while Obama “leaves power with an approval rating that his successor can only envy,” Trump is “a devotee of dystopia” who has “never felt constrained...by the facts” and the brevity of whose inaugural address “testifies to an obstinate denial of the complexity of the world.” (In fact, Trump's inaugural address was two words longer than George Washington's first, 1,298 words longer than Washington's second, and more than twice as long as Lincoln's second.) Also, Trump, in Le Monde's view, fails to recognize the “roots” of jihadism. (The problem here, I daresay, is that Trump grasps the “roots” of jihad all too clearly for Le Monde 's comfort.)

Then there was Morten Strand, who in Norway's Dagbladet called Trump a liar, then strung together a series of flat-out lies about Trump, then mocked him for accusing the press of lying about him. Strand sneered that Trump had “gone bankrupt four times on foolhardy ventures” (as if Trump were a pauper and not a staggeringly successful builder). Strand actually headlined his screed “Mr. Me Is President” – this about a man who, in his inaugural address, used a first-person singular pronoun only three times and the word “we” 46 times, whereas Obama, in his farewell address, said “I,” “me,” “my,” or “mine” no fewer than 67 times. After Trump's first day, Ole Moen, “one of Norway's leading U.S. experts,” told VG that Trump “creates his own reality” and “surrounds himself with lies.” (This is the same  “expert” who, pre-Obama, wrote that Americans were too racist to ever elect a black President.) Fellow “expert” Svein Melby agreed: Trump “lives in his own world.”

Accompanying all the Trump-hate in the European media is a newly resurrected contempt for the nation that elected him. To be sure, many are still so busy trashing Trump that they haven't yet gotten around to sticking the shiv into America generally; others are so far content merely to slam Trump's supporters as “uneducated” and “racist” while holding up Clinton's higher popular-vote total as evidence that most Americans remain on the side of the angels. (Ines Pohl of Deutsche Welle, for example, blamed Clinton's loss to a “demagogue” on “an antiquated electoral system.”) But others have quickly picked up the America-bashing where they left off in 2008 – and as Obama fades even further into history, more and more of them, I suspect, will climb back onto that saddle again.

Just check out Strand's Dagbladet colleague Marie Simonsen, who revealed her own ignorance about Obamacare in what was apparently meant to be a gibe about American stupidity: “It has begun to dawn on some [American] voters that what they thought was the work of the Devil is the same thing as the public health insurance they are grateful for and dependent upon.” In VG, Rune Berglund Steen wrote that American racism played a “central role” in Trump's election. In Aftonbladet, a Swedish daily, Karin Petterson agreed, charging that “there's something fundamentally wrong with...a country” that could elect “a lying, misogynistic half-person [sic] with delusions of grandeur...a bully who hugs racists and mocks weakness...a corrupt madman.” Though the masterly Obama, according to Petterson, “saved the U.S. and world economy in 2009,” even he “was unable to cure the greater trends that are tearing the country apart” – those trends, naturally, being resurgent “racism and hatred.”

In short, the same electorate that put a black man in the White House is, somehow, racist again. The same voters who twice anointed a demigod have now opted for Satan himself. Needless to say, a big part of the reason why Trump won is that Obama didn't save the economy. And if there are racial tensions, it's almost entirely because Obama inflamed them, viciously stoking the victimization culture and racializing absolutely everything he touched.

Not that racial tensions are really tearing America apart: that's an overstatement, and what Obama has damaged can, fortunately, be fixed. But one place that is actually going down the tubes – and is probably well beyond fixing – is Pettersson's own country, Sweden. It's on its way out precisely because she and other cultural-elite types refuse to face up to the very problems Trump has called out and has vowed to address. It's a country where the media, including her own paper Aftonbladet, systematically whitewash the horrific impact of Islam on their society. And many other western European countries, thanks to their own craven elites, are not terribly far behind Sweden on the path to utter self-immolation.

But hey, don't waste your time trying to explain any of that to the European media. They're back on the warpath against America. And this time they'll likely be more vitriolic than ever, driven by an alarm that the Trump revolt may soon be duplicated in their own backyard.",-0.9992,1863

Migrant Crisis: 77% of Belgians ‘No Longer Feel at Home’
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/01/18/majority-belgians-no-longer-feel-home/
by Virginia Hale            18 Jan 2018

The massive rise in the proportion of Muslim migrants in the country has resulted in 2/3 of Belgians feeling their nation is being “increasingly invaded”, according to a new study.

This sentiment was especially marked among respondents to the detailed survey aged 65 and over, 84% of whom likened the influx of migrants and refugees to an invasion.

Overall, 2/3 of the 4,734 people polled believe there are “too many immigrants in Belgium”, while 77% agreed with the statement, “Today we no longer feel at home as we did before [mass migration]”.

Entitled Black Yellow Blues 2017, the research was an initiative of public broadcaster RTBF and liberal newspaper Le Soir, carried out by sociology research institute Survey and Action and the globalist ‘This is Not a Crisis’ foundation.

Reporting on the study, which looked at the attitudes of French-speaking Belgians and how they have changed since a similar survey was taken in 1997, RTBF laments that it depicts a population which is growing “increasingly xenophobic”.

“The results raise many questions, but they revealed a society that is filled with fear and the rejection of otherness,” writes the taxpayer-funded broadcaster.

Produced by This is Not a Crisis, an organisation which seeks to tackle populism at a time it says societies in the West must undergo “permanent transformations”, the report claims researchers “observed the development of a true anti-Muslim paranoia [among Belgians], which has taken on a pathological dimension”.

According to 74% of people surveyed, Islam is “not a tolerant religion”, while 60% said the presence of so many Muslims in their nation presents a threat to its identity. Just 12% said they believe the religion is “a source of enrichment” for Belgium.

On its website, the foundation states that its mission is to replace a Europe in which people are “nationalist, tribal, xenophobic, withdrawn, closed [and] nostalgic of borders” with one that is “cosmopolitan, universalist, inclusive, open, with a strong legitimate citizenship and appreciation for diversity”.

“There have been attacks against the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Charlie Hebdo, Bataclan and terraces of Paris, 22 March 2017 [terror attacks] in Brussels, the failed attempt in the Thalys, Nice in July, 2017” the report states, acknowledging just a portion of the bloodshed inflicted on Europe by Islamic extremists in recent years.

However, these events are brought up in the context that This is Not a Crisis was pleased that “anti-Muslim paranoia … has not worsened following the attacks”.

RTBF was similarly disapproving of scepticism towards Islam, decrying Belgians for holding “the Muslim as a scapegoat”.

It argued that the “identity crisis Europe is facing” has left natives feeling “confused” and “[seeking] simple explanations like ‘there are too many immigrants’” to what it says are “complex problems”.

“Seven out of 10 Belgians think that immigrants want to impose their way of life,” the article notes disapprovingly, nowhere mentioning any of the attitudes disclosed by the 400 Muslims surveyed in the study.

These included 33% of Muslim respondents revealing they “don’t like Western culture”, 29% asserting they believe the laws of Islam to be superior to Belgian law, and 34% admitting they “would definitely prefer a political system inspired by the Quran”.

With regards to the question of openness towards the other, the research found that 59% of Muslims in Belgium would “condemn” the marriage if their son chose a non-Muslim partner, with the figure standing at 54% for a daughter.",-0.8937,808

Indonesia’s Hard-Line Muslims Push Ban on Unmarried and Gay Sex
Proposed changes to criminal code would expand definition of adultery to include sex between unmarried people
https://www.wsj.com/articles/gays-unmarried-couples-face-jail-for-sex-as-islamists-push-legal-changes-1517485322

By Ben Otto and Anita Rachman  Updated Feb. 1, 2018 10:32 a.m. ET

JAKARTA, Indonesia—Sex outside marriage, gay sex and cohabitation of unmarried couples would become illegal in Indonesia and punishable with prison terms under proposals from Islamist political parties whose influence has grown with the popularity of their conservative agenda.

The proposals are part of a draft of a revised criminal code that has been the subject of debate this week between Islamists who seek heavier penalties and more moderate lawmakers who want to restrict the scope and severity of such punishments.

The revisions cover a wide range of rules including those on freedom of speech, in what would be the most significant changes to the code since its adoption from a Dutch colonial-era law in the 1940s.

“This is one of the biggest Shariah-inspired shifts by revision of a law since the fall of Suharto,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, referring to the longtime dictator whose ouster in 1998 launched a democratic era in Indonesia.

Mr. Harsono said the new code would encourage hard-line groups to take the law into their own hands. In recent years, such groups have gone beyond sweeps of bars to organizing protests, at times numbering hundreds of thousands of people.

“We respect private rights, but we must not let private rights undermine the public’s rights,” said Nasir Djamil, a member of Islamic Prosperous Justice Party.

The revision is moving forward now partly because of regional elections this year and a presidential election in 2019, leaving mainstream parties less willing to oppose the conservative Islamist parties that have gained ground in recent years in this country of 250 million people, the largest Muslim-majority nation.

    Men Punished With Lashings for Same-Sex Relations in Indonesia (May 23, 2017)

“While the secular-nationalist parties are not driving this, I can’t see any of them risking their Islamic credentials ahead of elections by opposing,” said Hugo Brennan, Asia politics analyst with risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.

The new code, a recent draft of which was seen by The Wall Street Journal, would expand the definition of adultery from marital infidelity to include sex between unmarried people and make the offense punishable by up to five years in prison, up from nine months currently.

The debate comes as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights face increasing opposition, particularly from conservative Islamist and right-wing groups.

Same-sex relations are currently only banned in the province of Aceh, while same-sex marriage isn’t allowed anywhere in Indonesia.

Islamist activists in December 2017 appealed to the Constitutional Court to criminalize all sex out of wedlock and cohabitation, defined as living together as a married couple outside of marriage. The court narrowly rejected their petition in a 5-4 vote as being beyond its mandate.

Other articles in the new code would ban people from criticizing the president. The draft also expands an article on blasphemy—increasingly used to jail adherents of minority faiths, including Jakarta’s Christian governor last year—and increased the severity of punishment for the crime.

One participant in the discussions on behalf of the government said that talks were focused on toning down some of the articles, such as reducing punishments or by punishing singles for having sex only if reported by parents of the couple.

Another participant said one goal of the adultery provisions was to better protect women and children.

“There are many cases of women being tricked by men into sexual relations, and [they] have no grounds to report it,” said Ichsan Soelistio, a member of the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.

For gay couples, Mr. Soelistio said, a punishable violation could be limited to public displays.

Lawmakers have attempted to revise Indonesia’s criminal code for decades, arguing that it is out of step with a modern country. Various drafts have appeared over the years, but none has made it into law, partly a reflection of the complexity of opening up hundreds of articles to revision.

Amsterdam: One Dead, Several Wounded in Shooting
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/01/26/amsterdam-one-dead-several-wounded-shooting/
by Chris Tomlinson        26 Jan 2018

Dutch police are responding to an apparent mass shooting on Grote Wittenburgerstraat, east Amsterdam Friday evening 26 January 2018 which has left one dead and two wounded.

Update 18:08 EST: Police have confirmed that the individual killed was a 17-year-old young man of Moroccan descent. Witnesses to the shooting say the attackers were wielding Kalashnikov rifles.

The news has fueled speculation that the shooting could be linked to the so-called “Mocro War” between rival Moroccan gangs which has seen a series of killings over the last several years including a decapitated head left in an Amsterdam street in 2016.

UPDATE 15:40 EST: Dutch media have claimed that the victim in the shooting was a teenage male and that the shooters were wearing balaclavas to conceal their faces. Police have so far not commented on the identity of the victim or the shooters who are still on the loose.

The Amsterdam police released a statement Friday evening stating one man had been killed in the “multiple shootings”, while two others had been transferred to a nearby hospital with injuries.

A police manhunt for suspects is underway and several streets adjacent to the shooting have been closed off. No arrests have yet been made.

    Schietincident Grote Wittenburgerstraat:

    1 persoon is overleden, 2 andere personen zijn met onbekend letsel naar ziekenhuizen overgebracht.

    — Politie Amsterdam eo (@Politie_Adam) January 26, 2018

National newspaper De Telegraaf states police have received a large number of enquiries over whether the shooting was related to terror, to which they reportedly responded: “that is certainly not the case… it seems to be a criminal matter.”

EPIC VIDEO: Flemish Patriots Tear Down Massive EU Flag From Historic Castle At Open Borders Event. Shocked Leftists React In Horror
http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/03/video-flemish-patriots-tear-massive-eu-flag-historic-castle-open-borders-event-shocked-leftists-react-horror/
by Damien Cowley   7 March 2018

Historic Gravensteen Castle (Ghent, Flanders) was selected by a coalition of left-wing groups last weekend to represent ”Fortress Europe” in a migrant solidarity event billed as the symbolic storming of an EU closed to migrants.

Instead it was the event itself which was unexpectedly stormed by a newly formed nationalist youth movement, Schild en Vrienden (literally ”Shield and Friends”) https://schildenvrienden.com/  https://twitter.com/schildnvrienden?lang=en , several dozen members of which purposefully strode into the 12th century castle, proceeding to cut down a gigantic EU flag from its walls and challenging what they referred to as ”state subsidized propaganda.”

‘’He’s sabotaging the action!’’, a leftist organizer cries out from the upper walls of the castle as Schild en Vrienden leader, the photogenic Dries Van Langenhove, dramatically climbs over a crenellated rampart to cut down a vertical banner promoting the storming of the fortress, the fortress in this case being a metaphor for a Europe supposedly closed to migrants.

This is an AMAZING video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1dAFSdRciI

In spite of NGO narratives, official statistics show that a staggering 5 million migrants arrived to claim asylum in the EU between 2011 and 2017, with almost 3 million asylum applications being made in 2015 and 2016 alone.

Beneath the castle walls meanwhile, members of the newly formed nationalist group – sharing similar aims but not related to ”hipster nationalists” Generation Identity – displayed Flemish crests and signs calling for ‘’Secure Borders, Secure Future.”

Weekend visitors to the touristic attraction soon began to notice the commotion taking place as tensions rose and the central prop of the event, a gigantic EU flag bearing the phrase ‘’Europe it can be different’’ was cut down from its prominent position, left hanging neither up nor down until a handful of nationalists at ground level tore it away from the castle walls.

Angry shrieking and gasps of incredulity can be heard from supporters of the open borders event as the flag is torn down. Cheers erupt simultaneously.

At various intervals during the day, left-wing organizations – including a theatrical troupe – had led small children in mock attacks on the castle, storming through its gatehouse in a politically themed spectacle featuring people smugglers and stern border enforcers. Informational stalls calling for politicians to ensure safe migrant routes into Europe also featured as part of the event.

‘’Flemish youth will not allow their cultural landscape to be abused for leftist open borders propaganda’’, Van Langenhove confidently asserts whilst surrounded by supporters in a slick video released by the group following Saturday’s action.

‘’We want to change the mindset of the Flemish youth. We want them to stand up and be proud of who they are’’, he explained to The Gateway Pundit, adding that since founding last August, his organization has attracted almost one thousand members.

‘’Our ambitions are very big. We want to become a mass movement.’’

And the name?

”It’s an historical reference, ‘‘Schild en Vriend’’ [”Shield and Friend”], not really meant for translation. It was something the Flemish used to shout when the French tried to invade us in 1302, but the simple Flemish farmers and craftsmen beat back a whole professional French army of knights.’’

A rallying cry he sees striking a chord with countrymen in more modern times, regardless of ”state subsidized propaganda” for open borders.

1.  There are approx. 900,000 Muslims in your country (2006 data).  You have fewer than 60,000 soldiers.  You're in trouble.

2. ""There have been calls for an urgent debate
    in the Dutch parliament about the integration of Muslim immigrants amid
    claims that one area of The Hague, known locally as “the Sharia
    triangle”, is being run by a form of unofficial Sharia police.

    The claims relate to the district of
    Schilderswijk, about two kilometres from the city centre, where an
    almost entirely Muslim population of some 5,000 people surrounds the El
    Islam mosque, fuelling criticism that the government has failed to
    ensure a proper ethnic mix in schools and local housing. One recent
    investigation, in which local people were extensively interviewed,
    concluded that Schilderswijk had become “orthodox Muslim territory”
    which was now largely ignored by the city authorities, by politicians
    and even by the police, on the grounds that it had become
    self-regulating.

    The investigation found that orthodox
    Muslims had become so dominant that they were dictating what people in
    the neighbourhood wore and how they behaved.

    “The norms of the majority are beginning to take over,” it said.

    In the case of women, dress was a
    particular issue. One woman told how her daughter had been approached
    and told her short skirt was inappropriate, while her son had been
    called a “kaffir” – a racist term formerly used in colonial South Africa
    to refer to a black person – for smoking.

    A youth who had previously been involved
    in local gangs said that criminality had dropped off, not because of the
    police, but because he and his friends were “afraid of the wrath of
    Allah”.

    Another man said he felt he was gradually
    being driven out of his home because he had a dog, and many traditional
    Muslims tended not to keep or favour dogs.

    A veiled Muslim woman, however, defended
    Islamic practices, and said dressing modestly would “do the locals
    good”. She pointed out that women in the Dutch ultra-conservative,
    largely Protestant, Bible Belt also wore long dresses, and that shops
    there were closed on Sunday – as many in Schilderswijk were on Fridays.

    Local police chief Michel de Roos said:
    “We have no indications there is a form of Sharia police here. That is
    not to say it does not happen, but we are unaware of it.”

    Last Tuesday, social affairs minister
    Lodewijk Asscher and right-wing Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders paid
    separate visits to the area, and are to report to parliament.""

1.  Tell us all about the ‘Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie’.

2.  Dutch were pro-German in WW1 and therefore 'conquered"" and like a conquered country, had little control over its own territory and internal politics:
https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/intelligence_and_espionage_the_netherlands

"" Dutch Responses to Foreign Espionage Activities
GS IIIs policy was not to interact directly with representatives of the belligerents, but only via intermediaries. The intermediaries were the municipal police, the military police and state detectives who continuously shadowed the comings and goings of many foreign agents. The system of keeping in touch with British and German agents gave the Dutch a reasonably good insight into the workings of foreign spies on Dutch territory. By giving foreign agents some leeway to ply their trade, but also by questioning them and preventing clashes between spies of different countries, the system worked two ways. Foreign agents collaborated with the Dutch authorities, who in return gave them some freedom as long as Dutch interests were not violated. Moreover, via the agents the Dutch let the belligerent states know time and time again that maintaining neutrality was their one and only goal. In addition two liaison officers were appointed to report on the court cases and other developments relating to espionage within the Ministry of Justice. GS III’s idea was to get as much information out of the agents as possible, while leaving them in peace as long as they did not disturb public order, endanger Dutch neutrality or entangle Dutch citizens in their activities. Dutch law had not foreseen a situation of long-term mobilisation in which foreign spies used Dutch territory for activities not directed directly against Holland but against other belligerents. The number of court cases remained low, and not all cases brought before a judge ended with a conviction. It was difficult to prove both that neutrality had actually been endangered and what the exact intentions of the accused had been.

The Dutch penal code contained three articles relevant to espionage, articles 98, 100 and 430. The first put a maximum of six years’ imprisonment on handing over state secrets to third parties by which the interest of the state or its allies could be harmed. Article 100 put a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment on actions that could implicate Holland in war. Article 430 set a maximum sentence of two months on the unauthorised drawing or measuring of military installations. Article 98 demanded criminal intent and proof that information had actually been handed over to a foreign power. In court this proved difficult to establish. The same problem arose with article 100, which demanded evidence of criminal intent to create a situation from which war might follow. Article 430 did not mention photography and was vague on what could be considered objects of military interest. Moreover, the modest maximum penalty prevented temporary custody for suspects.

When the first cases were brought before a court, they resulted in acquittals because neither the intention to harm neutrality nor the actual fact of jeopardizing neutrality could be proven.  Another course of action proved more successful, but could not be considered a real alternative: in March 1915 a Dutch employee of the State Telegraph who had sold military information to the British, was convicted under article 363, which put a four-year maximum sentence on acceptance of money or services in exchange for dereliction of one’s duty.  From 1917 to 1919 eight other telegraphists were similarly prosecuted and convicted.  The sentences were relative mild, not exceeding one year. The longest sentence during the war years was three years for selling Dutch military information. The perpetrator was a Dutch soldier.

Another option was forced eviction from Holland based on the 1849 Law on Aliens. Article 12 of that law gave the possibility to evict somebody who was disturbing public peace and order.  At the local level the military authorities could evict people from the areas under martial law. This was done many times, after suspects had been charged for smuggling or espionage. The commander-in-chief, appalled by the behaviour of the foreign consuls, regularly stressed the need both to strengthen the laws against spying and to expand military rule over the entire country, but the government was not prepared to follow his far-reaching proposals.

The minister of justice did put forward some proposals to amend the penal code and adjust it to the fact a large number of foreign agents, who were in general not acting against the Netherlands, had to be monitored and kept within acceptable bounds. In 1914 the new article 103a had already proposed a six-year maximum sentence for handing over military information to a foreign power, with the intention of harming the interests of the Dutch state. Also, in the spring of 1915 a new article (100b) was proposed, which put a four-year sentence on delivering information to a belligerent state, while Holland itself was neutral. This information had to be damaging to the interests of the opponent(s) of the belligerent. Neither proposal was ever implemented, but it is interesting that the government in its explanation mentioned that the general sense of justice demanded action against spying, even when Holland was neutral and even when international law was unclear on this. In daily practice GS III’s pragmatic solution prevailed and worked.""

3.  Like Ireland in WW2: Ireland said, ""We're neutral!""  The Reichswehrministerium and Hideki Tojo then said, ""Fine!  We can deploy our agents on your territory to surveil Allied shipping!"" And so Japs and Nazis ran all over Ireland, gathering intel on troop convoys and killing those OVERWEIGHT Christian American merchantmen you hate so much.

Now, THERE'S another worthless country for you---Ireland!  They're having trouble with muzzies also (recent killing in Dundalk).

"Voice of Europe: Mohammed Most Popular Name For Newborn Boys In The Netherlands For Second Year In A Row…

Celebrate diversity!

Via Voice of Europe:

    Dutch mainstream media reported that Noah was the most popular baby name for boys in the Netherlands, but a little digging turned out a different finding.

    The name Noah was putatively considered the most popular boy’s name for 2017, having been given to 635 new-born boys in the Netherlands. A journalist from broadcaster Powned did some research into the database, however, and noticed that another name, a non-traditional Dutch name, was slightly more prevalent.

    This journalist checked for Mohammed and its alternative spellings. He thus counted:

    Mohammed 221, Mohamed 211, Muhammed 110, Mohammad 51, Muhammad 43 and reached a total of 636. Other forms like Mohamad, Muhamed, Muhammet, Mouhamed, Muhamad and Mahamuud could not be checked for “privacy reasons”.

    Of course, other forms of Noah like Noa and Noach should be checked as well for the sake of fairness: both, however, were not listed according to the Dutch journalist.

    The author says, it is the second year in a row that Mohammed is the most popular name for baby boys: In 2016 there were 724 baby’s named Mohammed (or one of it’s Arabic alternatives) in the Netherlands.

    He also mentions that the same tendency was seen in England in 2016: It is not Oliver, but Mohammed (with all its permutations), that is the most popular name for baby boy",0.9816,292

While its true that the new party VNL did not get any seats, another new conservative party (FvD) got two seats. Your info on our new coalition is wrong too.

"dizzymasekela he could never say that. For one, I think he believes the lies at this point. And second, his boss, the guy he is beholden to, would never allow one of his subordinates to speak so bluntly. 

That was a man between a rock and a hard-place today. Just absolutely exposed to the world. And he couldn't say anything. They had to get some state dept intern to come in and save him.",-0.2165,85

"doctorale666 Dude, just the shut fuck up. You have no idea what you’re even talking about. The U.S. isn’t Europe, there are considerably more ignorant people here than there. People here are gullible, and easily conned into voting for politicians who power hungry, and unfit for their position (just look at who is president currently). Our system has also been corrupted by the Citizens United decision, which allows corporations to pump any amount of money into candidates, for advertising and campaigning, as they please. And that’s on top of the highly abused lobbying system we have on capital hill. So please, stop fucking acting like the system can be fixed in a day. Stop commenting on an issue you obviously know very little of, just so you can try and feel superior to the U.S. by acting like this guy lying in the Netherlands is somehow all of the American peoples fault.",-0.7323,184

"doctorale666 who says I’m crying? Lol, all I’m doing is criticizing your unhelpful suggestions, because all you really want to do is take a swipe at the U.S. You don’t actually care whether or not our country improve, so it’s annoying to watch you come in and try to make these suggestions without understanding the context of why we face these problems to begin with. Criticizing every U.S. voter for the reason this idiot is the ambassador to the Netherlands, is moronic to say the least (because those guys don’t get voted to be sent to the Netherlands as an ambassador by the citizens of the U.S. The president appoints them). And the majority of the U.S. electorate actually didn’t vote for Donald Trump, but he won anyways because the Electoral College skewed the vote in favor of the dumber, less populated states. It’s things like that, that dishearten and inspires apathy in the American voting population. But the Democrats have been making a comeback recently (something I guess you didn’t take the time to read about since you were too busy taking cheap shots at the American voters to make yourself feel better about yourself).

Clorox Bleach is right, your argument of “we just need to own it” is fucking moronic. It’s like saying, “well black people wouldn’t be getting arrested so often if they didn’t commit so much crime!”. It ignores the context in which the Trump victory occurred, and getting rid of the Electoral College isn’t as simple as you idiotically put it. So please, for the love of god, stop talking about things you don’t understand.",0.2728,340

son of Susan So which scary place exactly do you live? I live in Molenbeek in Belgium and I’m Dutch. It’s just an interesting news story when there is a slow day not much actually happens here. I’ve been here for two years not a single thing has happened to me. And I lived in the Bijlmer also nothing ever happened. In America the murder rates are much much higher and then there are the mass shootings. If you’re looking for a safer place then the Netherlands I’d suggest Antarctica.,-0.5688,107
