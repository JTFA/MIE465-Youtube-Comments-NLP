"Nobody follows ALL the rules and directions of a religion, nobody admits but everyone has different level of judging feasibility and convenience  of a religion's directions. Religion is simply in how to live a life easily from the centuries of experiences and learning of ancestors (normally and spiritually). Various religions have their way of god. BUT RELIGION IS NOT GOD. GOD DIDN'T CREATE RELIGION. No religion is more right or better than the other. Religion is unnecessary but (generally) it is easier for people to read a guidebook than to write their own novel. Believe in god or don't just don't be mean to people with whom you don't agree.",0.9792,123

"They mostly use the RED series. RED Epic or the Weapon, since filming takes a number of years they most likely used the latest camera when available. Most of the slow motion is shot on a Phantom camera, usually the Flex 4k or similar model. In some special scenarios like very dim or dark conditions, cameras like the Sony A7sii are used which are known for great low light performance. And of course, GoPros are not uncommon to see as well.",0.872,90

"Yes, the squeaks and chirps are from those animals, but not usually from the same moment. There's an audio guy recording audio with the film team, but you have to be close to get good audio, and you will ruin the shot in many cases with a big mic boom. Everything from grass noise and water splashes is added in afterwards (just like music and voice-over). But it is usually recorded at the same location, just not at the exact same time. It is the process of filmmaking. Just like a hunting sequence where they cut from prey to hunter is not usually filmed at the same time. It's almost impossible to get that in the wild.",0.5187,131
