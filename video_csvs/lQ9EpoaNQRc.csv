"Andy Cohen is growing less and less likable and just a bit obnoxious, sorry to say. Timmy was too smart for him, however; he (Timmy) stayed polite but just refused to have his privacy invaded any further than he wished. Andy also needs to lose the scruffy beard; he's not 30 anymore and is looking pretty ragged. He's awfully impressed with Andy; hence, embarrassing and boring. Perhaps he's suffering from burnout.",-0.7852,84

Because Andy was very rude talking about PRIVATE things when they were talking about the movie...it's embarrassing. ..probably it will be more bearable if the relationship is in the present like Armie and Elizabeth but no .it's his past ..and it was totally out of line asking for details üòê,-0.6119,55

"Johnny Grande Lol. That ""age gape"". Stop giving away the game. I don't think you even know wth you want to argue. It's not molesting when they are 14 but some guy you don't like that boned a kid is a molester? Is it only molesting if you don't agree with their politics? If you like their positions they can screw little kids?",-0.8478,72
Johnny Grande Well then get out there and start banging little boys and girls. Why are you wasting time talking to me? Do you know how easy it is to seduce children? You are one pocketfull of candy and a stuffed unicorn away from bliss. Maybe head over to the Philippines and get you a piece of those totally acceptable and legal 12 year olds. Yum yum!,0.8753,73
"Johnny Grande Yep, It's super ok to screw little girls. Myself and society is totally into college age guys and high school girls and never never ever calls it out ever ever never ever... Lol...

Seriously that question was really unnecessary and nothing related to the movie at all and it‚Äôs PERSONAL! Stupid interviewer. I have the seen such a rude interviewer before. The nerve üò°,-0.8122,36
"Something that I applaud you totally. I am not a celebrity, and it still makes me unnerved that a person tries to get into my intimate life. Timmy will only answer that question the day he finds a person (regardless of whether he is male or female) that he feels strong about. And you do not have to force things, when two people connect everything, it happens naturally, I believe. But the rest stays out, and it seems very good to me.",0.8588,94

"riverw007 No thanks, molesting children is more of a Republican thing, see Roy Moore. A 17 yo is definitely old enough to date a 24 yo, that's hardly a shocking age gap. Teenagers are sexual beings, get over it, they're not fucking children.",-0.4228,52
