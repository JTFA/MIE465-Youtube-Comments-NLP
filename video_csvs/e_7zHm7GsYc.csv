"[Verse 1]
Look at you, just look at you
You’re perfect, that’s for sure
Diamond eyes and beauty like I’ve never seen before
You should be shining like a star instead of crying like you are
Held by a man who don’t know what he has
How can I make you see…
[Chorus]
You should be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
You should be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
You should be missed by somebody
Kissed by somebody
Loved by somebody, like me
(Should be loved by somebody, oh, like me)
(Should be loved by somebody)
[Verse 2]
If I were him
Yeah, if I were him
I’d never leave your side
I’d take you out and take you home
Take up all your time
I’d never steal you from his arms
I don’t mean him any harm
But I can’t keep my silence as hard as I try
All I’m trying to say is…
[Chorus]
You should be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
You should be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
You should be missed by somebody
Kissed by somebody
Loved by somebody, like me
[Bridge]
Oh, if he don’t make you laugh until you cry
Hold you like you’re telling him goodbye
Dance with you, seen with you every day and night
Tell me why, why, why am I?
[Chorus]
You should be loved
Baby, you should be loved, loved, loved (loved)
Oh, you should be missed by somebody
Kissed by somebody
Loved by somebody, like me
Somebody like me
Oh, you should be…loved",0.9993,336
