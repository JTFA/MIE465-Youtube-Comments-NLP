"I believe that the swiss method. involves heating the egg and sugar together 1st. I have another meringue recipe that calls for heating the sugar/water to softball stage, then adding to fluffy egg whites, then whip to stiff peaks. When I bake it's at the same temp as Jemma's, but bakes for 4 hours, and without opening the oven door, you turn off the oven and allow to cool in oven. I usually leave it to cool overnight. Takes forever.  I did this last night. Excited to try Jemma's recipie today, and compare the two. Hope my experience helps.",0.9538,116

"Jeremiah 10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.

5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.

6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.

7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.

8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.

9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.

10 But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.",0.9725,274
