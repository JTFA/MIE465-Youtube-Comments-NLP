This time around hopefully it will be more civil than the circus Trump managed to dominate.  Foresight and learning from history should make an appearance.  Oprah will fall under then same scrutiny as Trump did, lacking experience and uninformed to the level we might expect of a President. But surely she possesses values far surpassing Trump's lack of them.  The debating format its apparent needs improvement out of its current chaos.",0.7845,140

Hollywood and its stars could have dwindled this problem mamy years ago but of course they all, especially Oprah, see nothing and say nothing.

like a human being in her old age? You could have afforded it. Or did you just ""tolerate"" her poverty until the day she died?

this is disgusting...what about all the people who should have showed up who didn't have power or money.  What about the women and men who are not white who do honorable things every single day and deserve mention.  In the global awards you said, ""All the Men and Women""  when are you going to mention all the ""Women and Men."" When is it going to be about the people, not the people who triumph in exceptional reasons.  Please, Oprah...I beg of you...Do not use Rosa Parks as a reference because as a billionaire  you could have easily helped Rosa Parks, who Little Caesars founder Mike llitch from 1994 when Rosa Parks was Robbed and assaulted, payed for her apartment until 2005, when she died.  It seems you have too much going on and you forget very easily.  For the people, by the people means the People...not just those who serve as examples in the broad scope but those who try in example, under little examination, to be models of hope in nature.
