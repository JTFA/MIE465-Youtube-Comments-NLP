"They should have 1) Put people more inclined mentally in the ""future"" house and more physically able people in the ""past"" house to begin, 2) filmed in the summer in a place with little humidity, 3) make pros and cons for each house. For example, those in the future have to eat dehydrated food or rations or something, like an astronaut would. Those in the past get fresh ingredients to eat and attempt to make food with. Everything in the future could be purely efficient too, so it would be less luxurious and more having to make certain sacrifices to keep up the efficiency of the future. It will probably still be favorable to the past, but it will be closer to equal that way. There could also be incentive to switch where your team stays after winning a challenge if you get a different reward for each place. What I mean is, for example if you chose to be in the past, then you would get a hint as to what the next challenge is and be able to prepare. If you chose to be in the future, then you could call and chat with family or friends. And the prize for each will be different every challenge. 4) SAFETY PRECAUTIONS OBVIOUSLY! HOW DID THEY FUCK THAT ONE UP?? 5) make the challenges half physical, half mental, and some with overlapping qualities of both. Knowledge of history and evolution should help you in these challenges. Again: No one should be in harm's way for any of these challenges.",0.9876,295

You then start handing out punishments like not allowing a person to eat; you basically do everything you can to let them know you are actively trying to kill them, and that to continue participating would be risking their health. But then, you sweeten the pot by saying that not only would winning the challenges help win you the game, but you would also get to rub it in the faces of those future bastards and have them live like you did for a change, and see how they handle it. And then you sit back, take notes, and watch the ants run around.
