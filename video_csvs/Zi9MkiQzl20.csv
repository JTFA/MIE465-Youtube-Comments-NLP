"(Paul's way of Repentance, turning from his old behavior/way of life and becoming a new man in Christ, accomplishing deeds worthy of repentance):

First to those in Damascus 
and Jerusalem,
then to everyone in the region 
of Judea,
and then 
to the Gentiles,
I declared that they
should repent
and turn to God,
performing deeds
worthy of their repentance.

(Acts 26:20).

***(Repentance): Indicates a complete change in thinking.

***(Romans 12:2)<---And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God).

***Paul speaks of the ""renewing of your mind."" We do what we think is best, what makes sense to us. 
Paul was killing Christians because he thought it was the correct course of action. Christ's revelation changed his thoughts, but his preaching of the Good News was visible proof that he had repented of his former ways.

***Genuine repentance is evidence by changed behavior!

(The Great and terrible Day of the Lord. When Jesus comes back to take up his bride and punish the UNREPENTANT Sinners of this Earth. Those that trample the blood of Jesus under foot):

For the stars of heaven 
and the constellations thereof
shall not give their light:
the sun shall be darkened
in his going forth,
and the moon shall not 
cause her light to shine.
And I will punish the world for their evil, 
and the wicked for their iniquity;
and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,
and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
I will make a man more precious than fine gold; 
even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
Therefore I will shake the heavens,
and the earth shall remove out of her place,
in the wrath of the LORD of hosts,
and in the day of his fierce anger.

(Isaiah 13:10-13).

(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9)<---And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ).

(Isaiah 66:15)<---For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.

(Isaiah 29:6)<---Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.

(Revelation 19:12)<---His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

The Holy Spirit is given only to those who OBEY Acts 5:32...Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil/(Holy Spirit) of gladness above thy fellows. (Hebrews 1:9)....But the wise/(VIRGINS) took oil in their vessels with their lamps. (Matthew 25:4)..

The Wise Virgins have the Oil/Holy Spirit, that is given to those who OBEY; (Acts 5:32); (2 Thess 1:8); (Romans 2:8); (Hebrews 5:9).

(REPENTANCE):

(Greek. Metanoia); Strong's #3341; This Greek word is a compound word derived from meta, meaning ""after"" and suggesting some type of change, and nous, meaning ""mind."" 
Thus the word strictly denotes ""a change of mind.""
But it also connotes remorse for sin, accompanied by a desire to turn away from one's sin, to God, for salvation.
Both John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries with a call to repentance. (See Matthew 3:2, 4:17)---A call that many of the social outcasts and ""sinners"" of that day answered, (See Luke 19:1-10),
but that the religious people rejected. (Luke 11:39-44; 18:9-14).
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(The Almighty requires REPENTANCE to be saved):

Wash yourselves, 
make yourselves clean;

put away the evil of your doings 
from before mine eyes;

cease to do evil; 
Learn to do good;

seek judgment, 
relieve the oppressed, 
judge the fatherless, 
plead for the widow.

Come now, 
and let us reason together, 
saith the LORD:

though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red like crimson, 
they shall be as wool.

If ye be willing and obedient,
ye shall eat the good of the land:
But if ye refuse and rebel,
ye shall be devoured with the sword:
for the mouth of the LORD 
hath spoken it.

(Isaiah 1:16-20).

***The invitation to repent has two parts.

***(1): The people must wash themselves by turning from their evil ways and by seeking justice, by rebuking the oppressor, and defending the fatherless.

***(James 1:27)<---Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself (unspotted from the world).

***(2): God himself would wash the people if they were WILLING and OBEDIENT to meet this condition.

***As the righteous judge, God both reproves the wicked and defends the innocent.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Jesus warning about HELL FIRE):

And if thy hand causes you to sin,
cut it off:
it is better for thee
to enter into life maimed,
than having two hands
to go into hell,
into the fire
that never shall be quenched:
Where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not quenched.

(Mark 9:43-44).

***(Cut if off): Should be taken figuratively; it means to take whatever drastic action is necessary to avoid sin.

***The imagery of Hell (Frequently called gehenna) comes from a garbage dump outside the walls of Jerusalem. Jesus hearers were familiar with the smoldering fires that always burned there.

***(((Obedience))) and (((self-control))) are necessary to overcome sin.",-0.9967,1260
