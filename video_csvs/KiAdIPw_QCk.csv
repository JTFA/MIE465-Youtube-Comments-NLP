"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!!! Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus!!! 

He LOVES us so much! He came down from heaven to die on our behalf. He rose again on the 3rd day and assured us of our redemption! Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus! 

So my friends, if you don't know Jesus, please call upon Him today. He will help you through the trials and tribulations of life, He experienced it all. He knows how it is to be human. He is willing to help you, so make this moment you seek Him. You don't need a fancy prayer, just speak from your heart. Be real with Him, and He will be real with you. 

He will also make a Way for you to escape the oncoming judgement that is quickly approaching this earth. He made a Way by His Body on the cross. He took our punishment upon Himself for us! Thank You, Jesus!!! Be exalted, Lord! 

To die without Jesus is very dangerous. So please call upon Him today, you WILL be saved! Hallelujah! 

Shalom. :)",0.975,222
