"As a oaxacan i respect you effort into learning the languange and exploring the culture, but there were a couple problems. Im not sure if you or you team asked for consent to film men and women working or to intrude on their work space. Another thing was that you consistently called quesio string cheese, as lover of quesio, that is disrespectful to art of the creation of this magical ball of quesio. Thank you for putting in the effort into making this video but for future reference you should do some research on the culture and the topic of your videos before filming.",0.8593,111
