"AWE---FUL... No. Seriously, Mike Mizanin is one of the top 5 BEST in WWE today... Its a shame they don't push him more. I'd like to see an ""earn it"" type championship run. Where its not a briefcase contract beating an already beat up champion, and then someone else does the dirty work retaining. No do a more REAL ""earn it"" run. Not to say he didn't EARN it before.

WWE just always downgrades him..
If WWE did another 'Nexus' or 'NWO' he'd be a great second or first maybe with Chris Jericho and Randy Orton if Randy had the same personality if he were younger..I don't know its just my opinion..most people would be fit for it..they just need to do a rewind and redo..",0.9451,82

I almost forgot how much I originally liked The Miz,0.4215,10
I also get the feeling John told miz that he was gonna propose to Nikki that night which is why it was so focused on John doing that at mania,0.5949,30
I always thought The Miz is angry because daniel bryan call him a coward. But the miz tell us what really happen. He angry because the creative control did have nothing for him when he was Intercontinental champion. But now he is a 8th time Intercontinental Champion. And to tell you the truth I hope the miz passes Chris Jericho's ninth reign Intercontinental Champion. Because the miz earns it. I respect Chris Jericho for everything he has done when he was Intercontinental Champion. For now somebody else  make history,0.9531,96

I love Miz,0.6369,3
I love The Miz. He deserves an important WWE World Championship run <3,0.8957,14
I never liked or appreciated the Miz until the past year and a half or so.  I think it might have actually been the talking smack segment.  now he has become a next-level talent that is capable of being the 'man'.  good for him - he has fought for absolutely everything that has been given to him.,0.242,63
I remember him as that spiked hair punk rock type look haha,0.4588,12
I think I add like maybe 2 or 3 videos a year to my favorites. This was one of them,0.6486,21
I think my favorite part of the video was at the very end where he talked about cutting that vicious promo on Daniel Bryan I still go back to that promo that he shot and I believe he is absolutely right you know in the WWE people like the rock John Cena Daniel Bryan they are getting praise and big opportunities where is people like them is there looked at as the mockery of the company so I believe that promo is just years of a frustrating times that he had the one thing about The Miz is that he worked entirely harder than everybody else because he had more to prove because he came from a reality show people didn't think that he would essentially last a year in the company and look he's the damn veteran I think what he said about Daniel Bryan is absolute fact you know Daniel Bryan said that he in one year's time he would be back on top and all of a sudden his s*** went rock bottom so in a sense Daniel is a coward because if I went downhill like Daniel Bryan did I would do everything in my power to at least come back in the next two to three years and come back better than ever before and I am going to defile the doctors and I am going to do the things that make me happy because if you really love this business you'll do anything to stay in this business and I just think that at that particular time Daniel really just quit just to quit I just wish that his now wife would have told him listen fight and fight like you never have before I know there's concern because of his health but I think he should have at least thought and at least worked harder to get back in that one cuz I don't know about everybody else but I don't really like him being him I would rather the GM rolls of Raw and SmackDown go to CM Punk on AJ Lee I think they would be really good tell me what you guys think,0.9421,366
I truly enjoy the Miz and I think he is an excellent IC champ,0.9169,14
I used to get yelled at by my friends. I cheered for him while he was wrestling at raw 1000. I was the only one in my section.,0.7506,31
