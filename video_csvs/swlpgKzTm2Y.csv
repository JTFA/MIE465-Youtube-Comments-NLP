What exactly is mental illness control? I assume you are referring to creating measures to keep guns out of the hands of people like the dick who shot up that school in Florida. How do you propose that happens? The NRA, sure as shit isn't going to be helping out, their only concern is protecting the sales of weapons and not the safety of the American public, noted by it's opposition to the Brady Act and thus the NICS background check system which ironically was in response to the attempted assassination of Reagan, a Republican and therefore in the pocket of the NRA. The bodies keep piling up yet for some reason our current leadership over the past two decades, cannot seem to get anything meaningful passed. The phrase ""special interest group"" comes to mind.",-0.8268,182
