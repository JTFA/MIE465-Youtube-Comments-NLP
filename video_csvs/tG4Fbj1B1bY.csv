"I like how everyone's bitching about the movies and films Netflix releases. 
Then says ""that movie"" is better than that. Then they watch and the plot turns out to be overused.
This movie is not that bad. Just average or mediocre.

I like how the prince is not that SO YOUNG (Not in his 20s). Having a prince that is in his 20s being crowned the next king is so overused.
The summary is different compared to the other ""prince"" movies.
In the end, there's a twist (For example, he's adopted or what so ever blablabla) that involves the prince and the journalist. The other movies is just one character, ONLY.

I believe there's other movie where the prince went to high school disguised along with his ""partner"" and fell in love with a woman.",0.8945,159
