"Chappell Roan came to my middle school in December 2017 and sang this song. I was crying for nearly 45 minutes straight. I felt this song resongnating deep in my bones and felt so moved. This song spoke so clearly to my soul. I have been singing this song over and over again. After she sang this song and felt instantly changed. Now I try my hardest to please those around me. I confront my wrong doings. I am truly thankful to her and her song. Thanks for waking me up, Chappell.",0.8516,103

"Run with the devil, go ahead run free
Run with the devil and dream
Smoke that cigarette, puff those rings
Blow it in my face as I breathe
It's alright now, you're just high now
You'll be fine now, you're just high now

Look at your mama, now she's crying
Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want?


You say, ""I wanna die young""
Wanna die young
You say, ""I wanna die young""
Wanna die young


Sleep with the devil, go dance with him
It's your life, do what you want to
Baby, why you so locked up in lies?
Don't you know you could have the truth
You say I'm boring, so you ignore me
You hear the phone ring, so you ignore me



Look at your mama, now she's crying
Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want?


You say, ""I wanna die young""
Wanna die young
You say, ""I wanna die young""
Wanna die young


You say ""I don't know how I lost myself""
With a bottle at the bottom of an ashtray
Smoking my regrets and realizing what I need to do is pray


And I know I've got more than enough
And I think I know now what I really want


And I think I want love, wanna find love
And I wanna be loved, wanna find love
And I sure as hell don't wanna die young
Don't wanna die young, wanna die young",-0.9977,390

Saw you open for Declan McKenna you‚Äôre amazing!!!,0.6884,13

You know what I disagree. The way she uses her voice in this video captures the essence of the music and forms into a piece that clearly displace how life can be hard but if you persevere you could be greatly rewarded.,0.6798,44
You may or may not remember me cause we didn't talk much in school but I just wanted to say it was a pleasure knowing you and I'm so proud of how far you've came and can't wait to see what the future holds for you! Beautiful voice,0.9594,49

"[Verse 1]
Run with the devil, go ahead run free
Run with the devil and dream
Smoke that cigarette, puff those rings
Blow it in my face as I breathe
It's alright now, you're just high now
You'll be fine now, you're just high now

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your mama, now she's crying
Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want?

[Chorus]
You say, ""I wanna die young""
Wanna die young
You say, ""I wanna die young""
Wanna die young

[Verse 2]
Sleep with the devil, go dance with him
It's your life, do what you want to
Baby, why you so locked up in lies?
Don't you know you could have the truth
You say I'm boring, so you ignore me
You hear the phone ring, so you ignore me
 

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your mama, now she's crying

You say, ""I wanna die young""
