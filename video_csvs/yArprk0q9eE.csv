 Please answer to this. 
While I was studying in my balcony, I just found out amazing thing.

 I have magnet hanging on a string. It aligns with the Earth's magnetic field and acts as a compass. I conduct my little experiments on it if I get exhausted by the books.
I found out that area of contact of between magnet and the test object is related to the strength of attraction or repulsion. I tried two different objects - a hairpin and a metallic scale. The hairpin was weakly attracted to the north and south pole. I tried with the scale in many ways. When I brought the corner end of the scale to both the poles, it was weakly attracted to it and when I tried to pull it out, it seemed to be easy. When I brought the flat surface to the poles, it was very strongly attracted and was very difficult to lift it from the pole without touching the magnet with my hands.
Can you please explain this?

"after watching this video i feel like once all particles expand far enough away from each other and the universe comes to a deep freeze or a standstill, that the process will go backwards and the universe will crunch, eventually creating another big bang, and perhaps even all of our experiences in reverse.

maybe in some trillion trillion years, becoming younger, will be just as normal as becoming older is now.",0.7351,78
"but what if the mirror isn't ""planar"" (or superdimensionally planar) and instead had a focal length where the image reverses.  this could mean that symmetry is only broken at the quantum level, right?",-0.631,40

"idk much about physics,  much less about anything, but lets imagine that a mirrors while it reflexes me it still works under the laws of the physical space it occupies, while i see an opposite reflection,  it doesn't mean its an opposite direction, lets say for example the mirror acts as one of those optical illusions we tend to see, in which changing the light makes the difference between deep . so, what we see is a paper thin image such a water, and while we think its going in the opposite direction as we close in, as soon as i in-merge my hand into the  object and it molded to my hand, it wouldnt stop reflecting as long as i it has light, it would still be oposite reflection but the reflection in the mirror would follow the same direction as my hand. i`d understand that in such case there would be no discrepancies. since it is very probable im wrong due to my lack of education in the field of physics, ¬øwould you be kind enough to tell me why?.",0.8843,201

"ken ho Time isn't a vector. It is without direction. :) We don't say ""See you in 10 minutes southward""",-0.357,24
"ken ho ken ho we can only measure it. It can't physically go ""back"". 

Time will always remain positive. It can slow and speed up depending on gravity and such. (And we can measure that).

But I'm not sure if we can see it go in reverse. We can apply theories as to what COULD happen, but that's it. :)",0.7021,72
"ken ho yeah, but for now time is relative to a few things. Recently if I'm not wrong, Einsteins old theory of Gravitational waves was confirmed. This was measured by identifying difference in times as well. So gravity affects time. But if time can be manipulated, it can be done through gravitational waves probably. 

Like, imagine a spear so dense in mass that it would slow time around it. Meaning if you threw it, for us, it would be extremely slow yet if u put a watch on the spear, only a few seconds would have passed.",0.7529,111

"particle spin towards the mirror when looking at the mirror 
You said üëâlüëâ when you look in the mirror you see your face not the back of your head üëâlüëà not üëâlüëâ, they are both spinning clockwise but for the particule in the mirror for its self it's spinning counter clock wise.

"so just a question on relativity/special relativity... when reference frames collapse or come into the same reference frame.. what happens? just as a hypothetical... a large hollow sphere with in-compressible objects (i know that all objects are compressible on atom level scales but lets just assume they have a fixed state forever, no amount of pressing can make them collapse and lets assume the same for the sphere, no pushing will make the radius expand) flying at near light speed into it, those items would take up less space from the point of the sphere correct? so the crux of the question is... would the objects fill it PAST the spheres reference frame by being smaller or would they same amount of STUFF just fit into the sphere as just packing it like a moving truck? i honestly dont have an answer (not that im a genius or anything just a dumb thought that might have a dumb answer) be interesting to here any and all solutions cause im just curious",-0.5252,187
