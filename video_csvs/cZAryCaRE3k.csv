"Since 1991 Star Wars has been my favorite franchise but in 2015 I became a little unsure then last year seeing The Last Jedi opening night first showing I felt ripped apart. 
As I watched Luke Skywalker die alone for no good reason in my heart Star Wars died too.
I still love the George Lucas made movies and the EU but it‚Äôs just not the same. For a character so special that is very Christ like to be betrayed that way by the director with the backing of Disney will always feel sickening.
Luke conquered the dark side and saved his father and the galaxy through love; in Last Jedi all that he was ripped to shreds by having him virtually turn on his nephew out of fear unwarranted, beaten like a bum by Rey and die alone because making a hologram of himself was supposedly too draining. That movie did not show love for the character who gave everything he had to save his family and the galaxy so I have no love for it and just utter contempt for the people responsible betraying Luke.
Star Wars was great with George Lucas because he taught us moral truths and spirituality, Star Wars is trash with Disney because they teach no lessons past women being superior to men lessening women and men in the process.
