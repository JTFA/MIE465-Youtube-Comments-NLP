"The Real Deal Look man. IT was having a historic season. At the time it wasn't a stretch saying IT was better or just as good as Irving. The man was balling. I personally was saying he was a better scorer. Which was right if you were watching that season. You're the exact type of person I was talking about. I say something good about the Wizards and you start talking shit. ""You said we're cancerous."" Correct. Most Wizards fans are indeed cancerous to Celtics fans mainly. Of course I don't mean all of them. However you proved to be one. Are Celtics fans cancerous? Depends. If you think always talking about how great our franchise is or how possible it is for us to get star players is cancerous then you would be correct. But we could say something as simple as, we have a chance at making finals and immediately get insulted by every cancerous fan that hates the Celtics. Don't associate me with other C's fans though. I respect players even if they aren't on my Celtics. I have little pride, so me saying Wall is better than Kyrie is no sweat if it's true. I still like IT though. Most Celtics fans don't show the man the respect he deserves. People would call him a midget here and then celebrate games he'd win through sheer clutchness as if they were in a position to be excited.",0.9854,267
