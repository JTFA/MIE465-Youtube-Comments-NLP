"April Nguyen so in the interview, she says that it was the first time in 13 years. Well according to google, 2014 would be their 16th year together. That means that when Tessa was 10 or 11, they kissed. My heart just grew 6 times larger",0.5719,52

"Erika Pereira I'm giggling so much right here, I actually just got sucked into this couple hard after we had the discussion about them on the Fred&Ginger tumblr. I love Fred&Ginger SO much and like, holy shit, this is exactly like it. Perfect synch, intense affection, flawless magical dances. I'm so in love with their art, I'm just binge watching the ice skating videos. 
Oooooh, yet another couple to squeal about and follow closely. Goodbye personal life, hello ice dancing. ♡♡♡",0.97,101

I came across a video on my tablet that shows the kiss up close. I'll post it here soon.,0.4215,21
I didn't see any kiss?,-0.3252,6
I don’t want to start rumour but one of my friends know them coach personally like I think it’s I’m uncle and he say that they actually have a romantic story (like in the past 5 years or lest) but he don’t really know everything you know but we keep having hope lol (sorry for my English),0.962,69

"I have another theory: They are well aware of all the attention they get with their ""supposed romantic relationship"", so they are trying to get as much out of it as they possibly can. They are just business partners who are trying to sell you something.",0.5859,52
"I have another theory: for the sake of ice dancing and their career, they have decided a long time ago  unconsciously to repress their feelings towards each other. When times comes that they won't compete anymore and start to live their lives away from each other, they will realize how much they need each other. there is not one man or one woman, i.e potential lover, who will come that close in understanding, feeling, to either one. Over 20 years, they have gone through ups and downs, they grew up together. It is pure love.",0.7964,111
"I have this theory that theyre secretly in love, but have hidden it from their families, coaches, and the world, so the ONLY place they can express their feelings is on the ice. The secrecy and the release of finally expressing it is so passionate that it makes their skating the sexiest thing the world has ever seeeeeen",0.8641,63
I know they've stated that they're not in a relationship but honestly how can you do something so romantic for so long and not fall in love with each other?,0.6352,31

"Tessa and Scott are so very talented and have the perfect partnership.  I would also love to see them become an item but as an ex Ballroom  (Dancesport) Dancer, I can tell you that a lot of couples form an intense connection and are Acting when they perform each dance and they're usually best friends who actually sometimes have actual partners on the sidelines cheering them on. This just proves how AMAZING they are. So talented, perfect Skaters and perfect Dancers. They play each and every part to perfection. 
They are especially close and after 20 years together, can read each other and sense each other. True passion for their performances and true respect and love and friendship as a Couple ... Dancing wise.... yes it would be awesome to see them as a Couple in real life but the amount of time they spend together, they'd probably have to take breaks and need space if in a relationship with each other.
Either way, Tessa and Scott, you are both amazing and are so beautiful to watch performing together.  MAGIC.
I'm Australian and I love you guys as if you were Aussies. 
You have my full support.
Thankyou for all of the behind-the-scenes work you do in gyms, studio's, on the ice and in preparation all together which sets you apart from everyone.  You're definitely a class act and have the world at your feet. Go for it and I wish you both every success.
Warmest regards from Australia xo⚘⚘⚘⚘♥⚘⚘⚘⚘xo",0.9992,283

"you can’t say to me that they aren’t in love. It’s too obvious. You can’t dance showing a connection like THAT and not be absolutely in love. If anyone disagrees please watch some youtube videos of couples dancing, you’ll note the exact sync between the two pairs, I promise you. (unless that couple ain’t actually in love)",0.9217,77
