Oprah Winfrey  is a sellout. She never takes a stand on racist issues in her own community and even works to promote political party that spreads hate and division. She is old enough to know truth. Malcolm x broke from nation of Islam. HE held press conference and told media and America that NATION of Islam and Nazi party and kkk  was aligned with Democrat party.  The nation of Islam killed him. They also gave green light on Martin Luther King Jr because they wanted segregation. HE was a Republican and Christian trying to bring races together.  The Nation of Islam has 2 million members and every college and prison on America catching lost black youth and brainwashing like isis. They are the largest hate org in America. Farrakon has admitted to having a civil rights icon killed. Nothing has changed since George Wallace said segregation now and forever. The Democrat party  is the same they just use misdirection tactics with race baiting tactics . Naacp race baiting Democrat org. Black caucus Democrat race baiting org. Aclu misdirection Democrat org. Charlotte white nationalist democrats pretending to be republicans.  Antifa flying world workers party symbol Nazi symbol. Naacp there to get people in feelings  and left media there to get people in feelings and mold the story. BLM  started by nation of Islam to tear down civil war statues in Democrat controlled cities because they know those statues was put up by southerners when seen government Marxist schools changing history before phones and facebook. If study those statues you find that history books don't match history on statues.  You may find a diff history.  You may find North may not be good guy and you been lied 2 . People better wake up . He'll you got a hate org of 2 million members meeting every week have YouTube channels preaching people around country and CRICKETS from black leaders and media.

The hypocrisy in Hollywood is second to none. These rich pieces of shit have known about the corruption and sexual misconduct for decades. Suddenly now its a issue when it fits the left agenda because they think trump is a sexual predator. When in fact Hilarys husband was an actual sexual predator but that's ok. Give me a fucking break. Where was the woman's march or antifa at the globes? Shouldn't they protest the event? Oh wait they can't because they have been programmed by the same Hollywood agenda. Wake.the.fuck.up,0.2519,98

These comments are a cesspool. You know why they were talking about sexual harassment? Because this has been affecting the media and entertainment industry in a way that can't just be ignored or set aside. They're not going to gloss over it and pretend it didn't happen in one of the biggest entertainment events of the year. Everyone calm down.

"These people that seem to be taking offense... Don't take this as an assault to men, but rather an empowerment to women. 
Women have dealt with awful shit for a long time and been silent about it, but now they finally feel strong enough to speak up for themselves. They finally feel like their word matters.

So let them be proud. Let them boast.

The only reason they haven't yet is out of fear from backlash from men... so are we still at that point?

"Wow, the people in the comments are all riled up! They are entertainers, they have great influence, they are watched all the time and looked up to. As much as we may want to just focus on the talent, art, and entertainment, you guys would be complaining had they not addressed the bigger issues that we cant ignore and that affects us all. It is a weird trying time right now and we must speak. Those of us with voices loud enough for everyone to hear; those with platforms should use it wisely. If its on their heart to speak on these issues and bring awareness then why not? Its not entertaining to me that trying to become an entertainer causes women & men to fall victim to sexual abuse. It is a job. We dont want to feel like we have to fuck our way to the top when we have talent, and the work ethic to be great. Its shameful and disrespectful. This is about men, powerful men (who mainly happen to be white and the history with that is soooo big that how can you not bring up race? Its not about being racist, its about noting how little has changed. White women are being affected by their counterparts power as well. How can we deny this truth?) who use their power (& perhaps privilege) to abuse women & men. This is wrong and should not be a practice at all. Sexual abuse is out of control its not ok. Might I add! This is taking place in the entertainment industry which makes it even more fitting for them to discuss this. Also movies are not just art, its stories, true stories sometimes, and the art has always been used to bring LIGHT to the dark to spread truth and awareness about love, murder, heros. Thats what acting is all about anyway. So why are they being penalized by some of you about the things they discuss? Actors & actresses are not running around playing with dolls. They‚Äôre telling compelling true stories and sometimes just entertaining stories that always have a lesson or purpose. They help shape our minds rather we want to admit it or not. To have that much power, how could you not speak?",0.9822,428
