2) Foxconn is practically a city in of itself. Suicides are to be expected if compared to stats from World Health Organisation. It's actually lower than the average of many countries.
3) Apple is doing more than anything to address issues like this. They have more detailed checks than anyone else using their factories.
4) I don't see you crying over people getting cancer in chemical factories owned by Samsung, then Samsung threatening their families to stay quiet.
