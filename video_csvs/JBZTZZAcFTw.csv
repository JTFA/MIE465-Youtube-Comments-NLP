My entire household expenses such as all utilities,personal property tax,home/car insurance,TV,internet,HOA,etc. is just $1250/mo. 
And that is just one place. I have another condo on Marco Island that's paid for and its still less than the rent of that place at around $1k/a month and still no roommates.
Also have a apartment rental in Rome and a place in Lugano Switzerland that paid for.
I make $160k a year working 4 days a week and zero debt as well.
And I save at least $3k a month towards 401k/Roth 401k,Roth IRA,emergency fund,taxable saving,investment,etc..

Even my 24 year old niece is doing better than that with no roommates in Singapore working at LucasFilms.

Don't know about anyone else but that's the reason why this woman lifestyle is insane to me.
