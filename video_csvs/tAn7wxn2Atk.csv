"Round 1: Ricky Bell, Michael Bivens, (Ronnie DeVoe), & Group]
This battle should be illegal, just like some fake IDs
Three dudes and one girl, you're like the White Eyed Peas
A capella cover tunes, huh? You think that's the bomb?
I guess it is for Pikachu, Fake Bieber, and Uncle Tom
Pentatonix!
That name's a hot mess
Sounds like a bad laxative with a hundred side effects
Never trust a big butt and a smile
(She couldn't pass)
More like never trust pretty eyes, a frown, and a flat ass

[Ronnie Devoe]
Here we go. Here we go

[Pentatonix's Mitch Grassi]
Okay. Okay. Okay, that's cool. That's cool. Hey, Josh, drop me a beat, will ya?

[Round 1: Mitch Grassi]
For '90s R&B, people say you're the best
If that's true, I can't believe our parents ever had sex
So when kids our age hear tracks from Bell Biv DeVoe
They turn the song off, more like Bell Biv Biv De-Hell No
They used to rock the flyest necklaces and shirts
Now they're only necklace comes from MedicAlert
Now run home and tell 'em Pentatonix sent ya
You shouldn't battle us when you're battling dementia

[Mitch Grassi]
I'm just sayin'

[Round 2: Ricky Bell, Michael Bivens, & (Ronnie DeVoe)]
One, two
(Yo, one, two)
(Yo, speed it up, speed it up)
Here we go, here we go, my man, speed it up
This the second verse
[Fast-tempo beat begins]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hold up, hold up, man, it's time to slow the beat down
Hear me clearly, like Halloween, it's time to dress these clowns
Hurry, hurry, step right up, these cats is lame
Only ten seconds left in their fifteen minutes of fame
(Stick a colonic in Pentatonic, let's get this shit out
Kirsten, come with us, baby, you three get the fuck out)
Yo, we only took this challenge so we could steal your fans
Teach you a lesson, show you how to rock with a real mic in your hand
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

[Pentatonix's Kevin Olusola]
Oh yeah, y'all think you nice?

[Michael Bivens]
Yes

[Kevin Olusola]
Let's drop that beat

[Round 2: Kevin Olusola & Kirstin Maldonado]
So y'all called me Uncle Tom, nah, that's just lazy
I'm still more black than three little black babies
When Bobby Brown left your group, you didn't have much to give
He hated you three, I think that was ""his prerogative""
Michael discovered Boys II Men, and that's cool too
Then they made a bunch of classics and ran laps around you
Don't talk about my ass, I'm a ten and you're a two
And, by the way, this ass'll never come home with you

[Beatboxer Josh Silverstein]
Oh, damn

[Michael Bivens, (Ronnie DeVoe), & Both]
Round three
This is it
(You ready?)

[Round 3: Ricky Bell, Michael Bivens, (Ronnie DeVoe), & Group]
First of all, we got the stage and the rage
What's that, Similac? I'm starting you smell your age
(You Sunday-school singers try'na kick your praise
So take a step back, this is the BBD stage)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, all you can say is we old
You got 10 million likes? We got 50 million sold!

[Pentatonix's Scott Hoying]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, it's not over, it's not over, I'm about to finish it

[Round 3: Scott Hoying]
You made so much money, you needed security guards
Now their only money comes from Social Security cards
We're gonna tuck you into bed, since you showed up in your jammies
Come talk to us once you won three Grammys
You have the laziest work ethic of any career
Had one hit, then hid for basically 20 years
But we like that jam and we think we can improve it
So listen to Pentatonix, the way we like to do it
