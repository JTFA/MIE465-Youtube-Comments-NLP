"I remember the shamWOOHOO video. Man, when this channel first started, I loved it to death. Sadly, my passion for it faded away with time, only because I grew and moved onto different content to eat away at my time. As I return to this channel, big as it is (can you believe I remember when it had less than 1 mil?), I see the fire in his eyes. The unrivaled creativity, with such clever execution and sharp wit gets me every time. Especially the conspiracy theory videos. Man, the Beyonce ""Lemonade"" video will always hold a special place in my heart. Expertly crafted, with engaging delivery. If that's how conspiracy theories are really made, I am awestruck. The slippery slope fallacy at its finest! Keep doin ya thing, Ryan. I never unsubscribed, and I never plan to. I do plan on watching your future content, from now on. You just recaptured the heart of an old fan :). By the way, my other two favorite videos from the early days of this channel were the ""How to be a ninja"" video and one where everything was a transformer. Your reaction to the computer saying ""you got mail"" had me weak af!

EDIT: Just watched the rest of the video! Superb writing as always! This entire video was nothing but a joy to watch, and I wish there was a way to watch this video for the first time again! Watching the magic unfold across my screen.... let's just say that with every video you continue to impress. The mention of having an imagination followed by the entire stop-motion sequence warmed my heart. Amazing work!",0.9488,323
