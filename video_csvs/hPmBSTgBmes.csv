"Dear friends you may feel lonely and lost in this big world, but just know you are NEVER alone. Jesus Christ always have been and will always be with you on this earth. He is all around you, hovering over you even as you seek Him. He is nearer than you dare believe, closer than the air you breathe. If His children could only recognize His presence, they would never feel lonely again. Jesus knows every thought before you think it, every word before you speak it. His presence impinges on your innermost being. Can you see the absurdity of trying to hide anything from Him? You can easily deceive other people, and even yourself; but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom loves you so much, can read you like an open book, large print.                                                                                                          

Deep within themselves, most people have some awareness of Jesus imminent presence. Many people run from Him and vehemently deny His existence, because the closeness of Jesus terrifies them. But His own children have nothing to fear, for Jesus Christ have cleansed them by His blood and clothed them in His righteousness. Be blessed by His intimate nearness. Since Jesus lives in you, let Him also live through you, shining LIGHT into darkness. Become one with Christ by telling Him you will give you life to Him this very moment. Repent and as Him to forgive you of your sins. Believe in Him, have Faith in Him and allow Him to lead and guide you in EVERY aspect of your life. Jesus Christ's love for you can't be measured or described using mere words. It is deep, eternal, and special just for you. ❤️❤️❤️ (Psalm 139:1-4;  Ephesians 2:13;  2 Corinthians 5:21)",0.9417,334
