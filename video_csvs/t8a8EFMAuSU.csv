There is untapped potential galore, and plenty of room for growth.",0.8807,70
"If you want to do the XFL right, then steal players from the college ranks that the NFL won't touch yet.  Offer to pay college's top talent with only 1 year out from high school unlike the NFL's 3 years out from High School.  Allow good players that meet the NFL's qualifications to move into the NFL and be drafted.  Get top coach candidates from NFL and NCAA, even the CFL.  Your real potential is to steal college talent before the NFL has them, but don't lock them into the XFL if the NFL wants to draft them/sign them.  Show you can be a developmental league for the NFL, one that is better than the NCAA that won't pay their players and that NCAA talent will flow into the XFL easily.  

I can not emphasize enough that XFL teams need to have professional coaching and safety rules. However, the reasons are nothing like what you might think.  Stupid stuff like the XFL's original 40yrd dash for winning the toss need to go.  Fair catch needs to be there.  How do you even BEGIN to run an XFL based fantasy league if you are setting up top players for being injured all the time?  Fantasy play itself is going to be big money you are throwing away if you don't look in that direction at the XFL's relaunch!  Give more incentives to watch XFL games by having a fantasy league with real money prizes launch alongside the XFL!

If the NCAA changes its mind and starts paying its players to compete with the XFL, that is when you start pouring the money into players (but I'd still have a team salary cap at that point.  Don't turn it into the NBA and MLB where people don't watch because a team can buy its way to a championship.  It's the one thing the NFL does right).  People want a winter league to watch on Saturday's/Sundays when there are no NCAA/NFL games on major networks and not cable.  Not everyone can get cable (or wants it) so XFL games still need to be broadcast over the air or be able to be streamed for free or at a reasonable cost.  Cable cutters aren't just streaming, many are putting up aerials to get signal.   

ESPN/ABC needs to NOT DO what it does best, and that is turning to social media for comments.  Just have experienced commentators that fans will want to listen to comment on the game and really REALLY limit social media coverage during games.  If a fan wants that, they know where to get it.  Instead of eliminating the kick for an extra point, make going for it 3 points instead of 2 points but still allow 1 point for an extra kick.  It'd give teams way more incentive to go for it if it was 3 points instead of 2.",0.9936,525
