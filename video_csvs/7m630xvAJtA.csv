"Hi!  Big Sarah Jarosz fan here!  I love this!  These 3 ladies are all so amazingly talented, so the combo is just out of this world!  I've been following Sarah J.'s career for 3 years, ever since I saw her perform ""Annabelle Lee"" on PBS' Transatlantic Sessions, and she just keeps rising higher and higher!  I am so happy for her!  I have all of her CD's to date, and can't wait to get this one!!!  Beautiful song here - beautifully performed!  Love your voices!",0.9835,106
