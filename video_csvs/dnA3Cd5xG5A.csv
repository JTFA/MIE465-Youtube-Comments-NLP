products that are cruelty free,-0.1531,5
"shaming non-vegans to become vegans is classist and ableist. veganism isn't exactly accesible to everyone nor is it affordable. being vegan is not exactly cruelty nor is being non-vegan. and being vegan is also not the healthiest choice for everyone and being non-vegan isn't inherently unhealthy. 

by expecting everyone to be vegan you are erasing the existence of those who cannot be vegan, shame those who do not have a choice to what they can or cannot eat, perpetuate a culture of guilt and shame around food diet, blame poor people for being unable to be vegan, and blaming disabled people who cannot survive on a vegan diet.

Being Vegan is Cool. Shaming Others for their diets is not.
