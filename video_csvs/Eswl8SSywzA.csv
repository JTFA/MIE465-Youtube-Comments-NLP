"As an ocarina player, I can tell you that you can tell the relative sizes and placement of holes for a simple 10-hole ocarina by looking at one. I can also tell you, though I have not made one before, that typically holes are cut before the two halves are put together. Mostly from reading about them. It's neat to see someone actually do it, though. People who make the nice ones by hand already know from experience what hole size goes where, and they make the halves around a mold to ensure that the internal sound chamber is the right size for the key they want the instrument to play in. That is a REALLY thick clay wall on that ocarina you made.",0.9042,137

I'm surprised I haven't seen any comments to attempted to correct your methods first thing you kind of did wrong is that you don't need to throw the clay on the table to get the air bubbles out all you really need to do is the Rams Head you gently push the clay with the palm of your hand so the part that you didn't press down onto the part that you did press down and just keep doing that until you get kind of a Rams Head shape then you can softly hit the sides of the Rams Head on the table no wonder there are so many cracks in your projects I'm not trying to be offencive or anything but did you even watch some videos of how to wedge and sculpt clay?,0.2263,136
"I've played around a lot with river clay and termite hill clay and what I've found works best is to slowly let it dry next to the fire, moving it every so often, making sure it's completely dry. After that I'd elevate it and put it in a pit with all the hot hot coals, then I'd cover the pit. I rarely get cracks this way but it does take longer",0.5239,76
"IMPORTANT!!!!

 i think the problem to the crackings is that you need to bury them with the wood of the fire that way it will take less time and less air-drying. Also you can put play over the cracks. Either way I hope it Helps .",0.6083,51
