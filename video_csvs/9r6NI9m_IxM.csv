I have seen him many times since the 70`s. What I hope for in this last tour is that he gives us some songs from his amazing career that he don`t usually play. Instead of the standard hit songs. There are some great songs that never been played live,0.9035,56

"I just found out that Elton had surgery on his throat in the 1980's. That's why he sounds like an entirely different person today!  Apparently he think he sounds better than before his surgery. Personally, I find his voice uninspiring and rather ordinary now. Much better in the god ol' days, and for this reason  I will not be going to his farewell concert.",0.8655,74
"I like Elton, but at 70 years old, take on a three year world tour Mmm. I won’t be buying tickets for the last year as he may well be dead. At least he sits down while he sings, that must be a bonus for the poor old dear.",0.1154,57

I've been fortunate enough to see him twice...I would absolutely love to seem him a third and final time <3 I hope and pray at least one of his dates will be Vancouver Canada. I hope I'll be able to afford the price of a ticket...concerts are much more expensive nowadays compared to when I started going to concerts in the early 80s. Of course there is more of a show than there was back then. Unfortunately security needs have increased as well.  Vancouver loves you Sir Elton John! Yours was the first album I ever bought.
