"notice how Wendy downplayed everything that happened to Terry Crews? instead of talking about the serious situation that happened to Terry Crews with him being sexually assaulted, she made it about her, like how she got so offended that he said African American instead of black, and then she even downplayed it even more by saying that it wasn't brave for him to speak out about being sexually assaulted, and talked about how he can lose his job by talking about it, then she even try to dig in his past and bring up that he had a sex addiction. This is basically what the corrupted industry does to scare the celebrities into not talking or speaking out about real situations that happens, they use people that has big platforms such as Wendy, and they have people like her to downplay the situation so that it is swept underneath the rug, and if the other celebrities continue to speak out, they lose their jobs and they get shunned by the industry, and they even get set up to get murdered.",-0.9661,193
