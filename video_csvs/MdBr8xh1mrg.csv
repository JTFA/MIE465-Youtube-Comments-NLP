"Animation doesn't make a story. It was a crap joke, and by the time we'd watched him go over it 3 times it'd become monotonous, Twice would've been ok. I was just a lame joke that's been done many times before. My guess is the award screen was added in editing and wasn't awarded. It's too crap for that.",-0.0408,66
