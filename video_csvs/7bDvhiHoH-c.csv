"Dear Friends Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life. He is the only way to eternal life. Did you know that salvation is the gift of Father God's grace?

All who trust the Savior are forgiven of their sins and born into the family of God by the miraculous work of the Holy Spirit. Dear ones, give you life completely to Jesus Christ this very moment.

"Hey John! So you took a bunch of liberties to personalize this (browning in butter, the pan sauce, mashed 'taters, etc.) and it looks *beyond* fantastic. Just stopping by to say: I know you don't often dig too deep into the Asian palate, so I don't know if you know this, but until your personalizations came into play, this was *incredibly* similar to the preparation of fish cakes found in cuisines across Asia. If you weren't aware of it already, you should check them out! If you like this, and also like the Asian pantry, there are some amazing surprises out there for you!

"I encountered something similar many years ago on St. Thomas US VIs at a place called Victor's Hideout, which was very much indeed, hard to find. I forget the name of Chef there but anyway, what was unique was that he did the salmon as the core of the sausage and then the white fish was the outside. It was served cold as an appetizer and other than Lobster Thermador, it was one of the most memorable dishes from that trip. I think it would be cool to do the layered sausages with your idea of browning them and serving them as you suggested. But, as always, you make it look much easier than it is for a hobby cook. I really enjoy your channel. Thank you Chef John! I'll give it the old college try!",0.9376,151

It is done with river fish meat (cheaper, not very tasteful), blended with a panade (a sort of heavy bechamel), formed into sausage shape and boiled
Typically they are then broiled in an oven, covered with a tasy sauce which makes up for the lack of taste from the fish",-0.5651,97
