"* ***SPOILERS*** *



Leave it to the This Is Us writers to stick very close to how we all assumed it would go down (they weren't playing with all the hints about the dog), and yet somehow make it hurt EVEN WORSE than we could have expected!! 

There's just something in how ordinary and quiet it all was... he was a freaking superhero for the fire itself, but as soon as he came out all heroic I was like ""oooh no, they're all going to be be all 'phew, you're amazing and now we're out of the woods!' and THEN he's going to die unexpectedly from complications, isn't he? D': "" And even at that point, I still couldn't have predicted how utterly devastating that whole hospital sequence would be. That they wouldn't go the whole ""intense medical drama"" route and make a big scene of Jack coding, but rather it's all just happening in the background while Rebecca has NO IDEA. And then it's over... and Rebecca's reaction was SO real. Just.. this show is too much, man!!",-0.9046,212

"... He's not? He was a moody kid and teenager (for reasons that were just explored a bunch in terms of how he felt like a 5th wheel), and yes he was especially mean to Randall growing up, but I really fail to see why people seem to think he- especially seeing adult Kevin- is suuuch a horrible person. Especially when, as an adult, part of the reason he so rarely opens up to anyone or takes off the ""actor mask"" is because he's clearly been carrying around this intense, intense guilt and grief over never having had any closure with Jack before he died. 

Yeah, Kevin in his anger over his situation with his leg had a bratty moment and took his frustrations out on his parents... plenty of teenagers have moments like that. Only most don't end up losing their parent in a horrible fire before ever getting to say ""sorry for being a jerk to you""... most people don't have to walk around the rest of their lives knowing that their last interaction with their parent, whom they loved, was a rude one, and having no way to make it right no matter how much they want to. 

I just don't get the hate for Kevin... yes, he messes up because he's not great at handling his emotions and never particularly has been. But almost every time he messes up he shows *genuine* growth from it. He's easily the most acutely self aware of the Big 3, and deserves a lot of credit for how hard he's worked to become a better version of himself even just within the present day timeline so far.",-0.9396,309

Everyone thought he had died from driving drunk last year.

There's also a big chance that he doesn't die in the fire at all, and that the kids and Rebecca are all crying over the house burning down.",-0.0654,84

"That's the part I have no idea about! With the information we have now, from Kate's side of things it really does seem to point cleanly to Jack running back in for the dog, but that's the thing.. this show is almost never that straight forward.

I don't think they're going to pull any suuuper random thing out of a hat, like Jack dying in some way totally unrelated to the fire or anything like that. But I think they're setting up this Kate connection to be the thing that's the misdirection. It just seems too intentional that they put in that line about Jack thinking Kevin might be home.. and even the fact that in the note he left him, he said ""you owe us an apology"". If Rebecca had told him Kevin had called to apologize, why would he say that? 

I think, ultimately, Kate's reasons for feeling guilty will probably be something we only learn in the next episode.. .but I think there are too many hints that Jack isn't aware Kevin's not there (even if we as the audience are) for that not to be the main reason he goes back in.",-0.1143,217

"This series has been building up to this moment, even though it's shown much of what happened to the family before and after Jack's death. The family in present day is still affected by it and they don't talk much about it with other people or each other, and definitely never in detail, so the viewing audience doesn't know everything about that night, either. There have been hints, but we got the biggest hint at the beginning of season 2 (this season), and then little hints ever since then. The biggest reason it's showing after the Superbowl (outside of trying to get even more viewers) is because it was Jack's favorite day of the year, and also because Jack died the night of the Superbowl in 1998 (20 years ago), so they will probably lean into that a lot in this upcoming episode.",-0.4215,161

"You know, I think I had assumed everyone but Kevin was there just because of how they set it up in 2x1, but actually seeing it really does make you realize how truly, truly traumatizing that whole experience would be! It's horrible enough to lose a beloved parent unexpectedly at 17 years old, but to actually be there to have to see said parent die in a horrifying fire while also losing *everything* of the only home you've ever known at the same time? Or, in Kevin's case, to be the only one who *wasn't* there and have to live with the burden of not having any closure? They're really not doing too badly all things considered!! Really, they probably all could have majorly benefited from therapy from then on out just as a matter of dealing with such serious trauma... Rebecca as well.",-0.9633,162
"You know, as much as it makes so much sense for it to be the dog based on the information we have so far, I'm thinking there'll be a curve ball in there! Usually when the show makes something seem very much one way, that's when they'll do a twist and it will be something you don't expect. 

The more I think about it, the more I can't shake the thought that if Jack thought there was ANY chance whatsoever of Kevin being home, and Rebecca wasn't there at that moment to tell him he had stayed over at Sophie's, there's no way Jack *wouldn't* run right back in. Even if he wasn't sure, he would never risk the slightest possibility that Kevin could be stuck in there without doing everything he could to make sure he wasn't. And there's one moment that stands out as indicating that Rebecca hadn't told Jack Kevin would be out for the night: when Randall came home, Jack thought at first that it might be Kevin. So he was expecting him.

So yeah, much as Kate's feeling guilty and her hangup about dogs is really pointing to it being about the dog... there's just a LOT of sense to the idea that Jack might not have known for sure that Kevin wasn't home, and that would instantly be reason for him to run back in. I'm not quite sure where Kate's issues would play in in that case, but I just don't think this show would be so on the nose with things. The more they hint that it's the dog, the more I think it must be something else.",-0.2992,301

"You're right, he'll get Kate and Randall out and then go down to the basement for Kevin. We see Rebecca in the promo gathering things in panic (I think what she's holding there is the transparent plastic bag with the Big 3 Homes notebook we saw in her car from Episode 1 this season). 
I think that Kate's guilt might originate from her yelling to dad to get Kevin because she too thought that he was at home. As for her issues with dogs, I suspect it's not even related to the fire. As we saw in this first episode of the season, the dog makes it and is alive, so something else might have happened along the way that discourages her from getting another one.",-0.8519,137
