tbh it's a little much to expect her to speak out on American issues _and_ Honduran issues just because her parents happen to be from Honduras.  I mean, I don't expect Tina Fey to talk about the Greek economic collapse just because she's of Greek descent.  Like, I'm sure she cares, just like I'm sure America cares about Honduras's problems, but is she actually qualified to speak on the issue with any authority?  ""My parents are from there"" doesn't mean she's actually knowledgeable about the situation in the country.  And if she doesn't have a decent understanding of the situation there, she probably shouldn't be trying to speak on it with any authority.",0.7579,201

Henry Haile tbh the only reason the show is famous is because Stephen Colbert was one of the first to slander Trump to get ratings. Trump is why he does so well as he is one of the main talking points of every episode of his. Also the commenter is probably right.
