"About Cyborg wearing garments: it's similar to the Andrew Martin android in Bicentennial Man (played by Robin Williams) wearing garments when he begins to yearn to become human; he initially wears a tuxedo because the daughter of the household, Amanda, wants him to be a groomsman in her wedding; and then he continues to wear human attire after the wedding as he continues his quest to become more humanized.

About Cyborg shedding his attire: it's like the scene in the first Avengers movie where Captain America tells the team mates to suit up as a Prelude to preparation for battle; Tony repairs his armor, Hawkeye stocks up his quiver, etc. When they reunite with Bruce Banner in New York City, cab says the same thing about suiting up to Bruce. And Bruce says he doesn't have to. In fact he sheds both his literal human clothing and his human good manners in order to assume his angry battle persona. Ben Grimm AKA The Thing of the Fantastic Four follows the same custom, even though he doesn't change his post transformation appearance. In battle he goes bare-chested with his boxing trunks, and when he's just socializing with his teammates or his fiance Alicia, he conforms to the custom of wearing attire.

Cyborg has embraced his altered metahuman persona",-0.2732,239

Superman is supposed to be the best possible embodiment of American ideals.

America might be a bit grim, dark, narcissistic and vulgar right now, but the last thing I want is a grim, dark version of Superman. If we don't feel comfortable making an unabashedly optimistic movie about American idealism, we probably shouldn't be making Superman movies at all.
