"(Immorality Must be judged):

But now I have written to you
not to keep company
with anyone named a brother,

who is sexually immoral,

or covetous,

or an idolater,

or a reviler,

or a drunkard,

or an extortioner‚Äî

not even to eat with such a person.

(1 Corinthians 5:11).

***(Not even to eat with such a person): Eating together is a key part of fellowship and closeness with others.

***The Corinthians were not to have fellowship with those who claimed to be Christians but whose lives were dominated by SIN!
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Immorality Must be judged) (Cont):

For what have I to do with
judging those also who are outside?

Do you not judge those
who are inside?

But those who are outside
God judges.
Therefore

‚Äúput away from yourselves
the evil person.‚Äù

(1 Corinthians 5:12-13).

***(Do you not judge...God Judges): The church's responsibility is to discipline its members while trusting the Lord to judge the world.

***(Matthew 13:30)<---Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

***Paul explains that he was not speaking of the pagan culture around them. If they withdrew totally they would be unable to function in the world. Instead, he was talking about the immorality in their midst.

***They should judge the sin among themselves, while still reaching out to the lost in Corinth.",-0.959,318

"Team talent trumps individual talent. That said, these young players are exciting to watch, and they are showing that they have an innate knack for the game. Simmons knows where the ball is going, and so he allows Lebron to feel like he's got an easy catch and post-up, but Simmons beats him to the ball. Embiid knows Korver only shoots 3s, so his only job is to force him off the 3pt line and force him to put the ball on the floor. On offense, Embiid is getting better of using his size and height to his advantage. Coupled with his post moves and shooting ability, he is going to be a threat for years to come.  While the game is moving away from the post to the 3pt line, I believe that having a player who can play out of the post brings a sense of stability, especially when shots are not falling. Embiid's next step will be building his facilitating ability out of the post. If Philly can run offense both through Simmons and Embiid...they will be unstoppable one day, and that day is going to be very soon. In my mind, they are only 1 wing player away from being a top 5 team in the NBA (e.g., Paul George, KCP or Danny Green).",0.9188,248
