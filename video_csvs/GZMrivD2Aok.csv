"""the first show was about tolerence, our show is about acceptance."" Really?  WOW.  Yeah, I am not going to be very popular with my post, but it needs to be said.  The original show, especially Carson Kressley & this show & especially Van Ness - do NOT represent the gay community. Look at the official picture of the guys, with Van Ness' hair wind blown - that pose he does is exactly what Carson Kressley would have done.  Straight people think that this is what all gay people are like.  Way out there guys that are on these shows are the reason straight people, especially straight men have issue with gay men.  look up Mark Bingham & flight 93 - that guy is a better representation of the gay community.  Wikipedia: ""Both for his presence on United 93, as well as his athletic physique,[2]Bingham has been widely honored posthumously for having ""smashed the¬†gay stereotype¬†mold and really opened the door to many others who came after him.""[3]""  As long as people like Carson Kressley, Van Ness and others are pushed on TV representing gays - there will always be a stereotype.  They are a very small sub-group in the gay community - and yet a lot of straight people think they are a large group of gay men.   Anyway, sorry, this is just my opinion.",0.9856,265

"@Jaiden Fox I admit the concept might sound if you were to describe the show in one sentence. Gay men help give a straight man a make over. On the surface, that dose not sound like that big of a deal, and possibly an odd thing to build a show around. But I did watch the original show.

It might seem odd, but one of the things the original show might have done was help humanize gay men. Or possibly bridging a gap between the world of gay men and the rest of human society. In the U.S.A since the original Queer Eye Straight Guy show,  my country has made some big steps in tolerance and accepts of gay people. Yet at the same time, my country still has a lot work ahead of itself.

The beginning of the trailer someone says, ""The original show was fighting for tolerance. Our fight is for acceptance.""  Which is possibly fitting description for the current atmosphere of my country. Gay people may has some more legal rights with the right to marry and the right to sever in the military. But there is still a lot of anti-gay hate and prejudice in my country that needs to be overcome. So maybe this show can being that bridge of worlds once more.",0.7896,244

When homosexuality is built up as an identity in and of itself it becomes a major problem. Manly Homosexuality is love of maleness, STOP TRYING TO ASSOCIATE IT WITH FEMINIZED DICKLESS TESTOSTERONE DRAINED SISSY BOYS! Homosexuality is so often associated with anti-social behaviour, but homosexuality is no longer something to be ashamed of, SO STOP TRYING TO BE PURPOSELY TRANSGRESSIVE, STOP TRYING TO UNDERMINE CULTURE, BECOME FULLY FUNCTIONING GOOD MEMBERS OF SOCIETY BEFORE YOU BECOME A PROBLEM!",-0.9502,127

And I was surprised by the location they chose -- Atlanta; the different backgrounds of the nominators and the nominees for the makeovers; and the more enlightening/rewarding conversations the Fab 5 and their clients were having at this point in our time.
