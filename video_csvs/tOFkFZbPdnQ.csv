"(REPENTANCE is required to be hidden from the Lords anger/JUDGMENT DAY!):

Seek ye the LORD,
all ye meek of the earth,
who have upheld his justice;

seek righteousness,
seek meekness:

it may be ye
shall be hid

in the day of the LORD'S anger.

(Zephaniah 2:3).

***(Seek The Lord): This is the language of true (REPENTANCE), renewal, and regeneration.

***(You will be hidden): Zephaniah used a play on words with meaning of his own name, ""Hidden in the Lord."" Even in the midst of the most calamitous judgment scenes, the mercy and grace of the Lord is still available to a (REPENTANT) people.

***(Luke 13:3)<---Jesus)<---I tell you, Nay: but, except ye (REPENT), ye shall all likewise perish.

***(Luke 5:32)<---(Jesus)<---I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to (REPENTANCE).

***(2 Peter 3:9)<---The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to (REPENTANCE).

***(Romans 2:4)<---Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you to (REPENTANCE?)

*** (REPENTANCE):

(Greek. Metanoia); Strong's #3341; This Greek word is a compound word derived from meta, meaning ""after"" and suggesting some type of change, and nous, meaning ""mind."" 
Thus the word strictly denotes ""a change of mind.""
But it also connotes remorse for sin, accompanied by a desire to turn away from one's sin, to God, for salvation.
Both John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries with a call to repentance. 
(See Matthew 3:2, 4:17)---A call that many of the social outcasts and ""sinners"" of that day answered, (See Luke 19:1-10),
but that the religious people rejected. (Luke 11:39-44; 18:9-14).
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Jesus is warning us to be watchful for his Second coming, because people will be asleep and will be partaking in the world and fulfilling the sinful desires of their flesh and not walking according to the spirit):

And take heed to yourselves, 
lest at any time your hearts 
be overcharged with

surfeiting, 
and drunkenness, 
and cares of this life,

and so that day come upon you unawares.

(The DAY of Jesus return should not take us by surprise. We should live as if it is imminent. Are you going to be a WISE or FOOLISH Virgin???).

For as a snare 
shall it come on all them 
that dwell on the face 
of the whole earth.

Watch ye therefore, 
and pray always,

that ye may be (((accounted worthy)))

to (((escape))) (((all these things))),

(The Wise virgins will go with Jesus when he comes back for his bride. (Revelation 3:10-11)<---Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown). (Matthew 13:30)<---Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers/Angels, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn). (John 14:2-3)<---In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will (((come again))), and (((receive you))) (((unto myself))); that where I am, there ye may be also).

that shall come to pass,
and to stand before
the Son of man.

(Watch...pray): Jesus encouraged his disciples to be persistent in prayer and faith, looking for the day when the Son of Man exonerates the faithful in the judgment, so that they are able to stand before him.

***(1 John 2:28)<---And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

***(John 3:2)<---Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.

(Luke 21:34-36).
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Jesus warning about HELL FIRE):

And if thy hand causes you to sin,
cut it off:

it is better for thee
to enter into life maimed,
than having two hands
to go into hell,

into the fire
that never shall be quenched:
Where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not quenched.

(Mark 9:43-44).

***(Cut if off): Should be taken figuratively; it means to take whatever drastic action is necessary to avoid sin.

***The imagery of Hell (Frequently called gehenna) comes from a garbage dump outside the walls of Jerusalem. Jesus hearers were familiar with the smoldering fires that always burned there.

***(((Obedience))) and (((self-control))) are necessary to overcome sin.

***The longing of the disciples for greatness needed to be reshaped according to God's purposes.",-0.8711,1151
