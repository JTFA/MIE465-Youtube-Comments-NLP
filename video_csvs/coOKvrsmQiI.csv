I am really pissed off about all of this, and how The Rock talks about ""breaking the curse of videogame movies"" doing another bad videogame movie. It is 1994 again?

I just don't think he's a good actor however he is a great wrestler and I think the rock needs to go back to WWE and start wrestling again for good.
