"It's so far fetched, but the Dyson sphere is such a cool idea. You could do so much more than just gather solar power with such a thing. Imagine a giant sphere in the Goldilocks zone. If you spin the sphere fast enough you could create a centrifugal force that mimics Earth's gravity around the sphere's 'equator'.

First of all do you even realize how much matter it would take to completely cover a star, you would literally have to travel around other solar systems to gather enough of it and that is just one of many problems you would have to overcome, secondly it is incredibly selfish to do such a thing  because the heat and light of a star is meant for all life and many simpler life forms would perish without it",-0.5081,95
