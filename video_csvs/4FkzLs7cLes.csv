I'm a hobbyist metal worker (I make armor and stuff) and am thinking of ways I might use this and I could see stacking up a few pieces before I fire up my kiln during off peak electrical hours (that sucker is expensive to run. :D ).  Taking it up to temp and just pulling one crucible out and placing in another one would save me heat up time and the power consumption that goes with it.

"I understand that argument. I just do not agree with it. Stratasys did not spend million of dollars to invent plastic deposition, it is a simple idea and it just blocked everyone from using it for 20 years. Once that expired (2009), the 3d printing industry took off. Indeed, it's one of the best cases to show why patents prevent progress. The incremental evolution of extruders shortly thereafter has quickly beaten stratasys'  own attempts of patent fencing and A LOT of these inventors are now having profits with their open-source designs (e3d and prusa come to mind immediately). Why? They adopted a different strategy. Instead of trying to stop everyone else to work on the problem, they fostered community and ecosystems, which helped mindshare and actual progress in design. There's a good amount of documentation on how to have a business with no intellectual property issues in the way. The Mises Institute wiki has a page titled ""Without Intellectual Property"" with 8 ways to do that and hundreds of examples.

"I'm not disputing that you can, but the point I was making was that you need a larger infrastructure for this system then just getting a printer. With a Laser Sintering 3D Printer you could put it in any room in a house that has the electrical wiring for it (well that is if an accessibly priced one was available for the hobbyist). 

With this system you would need to have the 3D printer near the kiln in order to reduce loss of material due to accidents (like bumping the crucible or dropping it), as well as having to deal with the additional issues of managing both the printer and the kiln. You also end up with 100% loss on all the materials used while the Laser Sintering process only uses the material that is fused. 

I do think that this way of thinking (bringing metal printing to the small time user) is a great path to follow, but I think that the Laser Sintering Process would be a better way of going if the idea is to make metal printing accessible to the home user.

"Interesting tech, but requiring proprietary powder filament & a kiln is a bit of a stretch for 'home' printing, along with the price.

"Just from a purely decorative standpoint, copper/bronze type metals have clear uses.  Brass is probably less useful since I suspect that the nature of the powder will make all the prints slightly porous, making a proper mirror like finish impossible.

Water blocks and such would have to have some sort of sealant applied before use, I'd expect.  Also, cleaning the interiors could be trouble, since you really don't want loose bits of sand and metal dust going through your pump.  In addition, it doesn't look like the machine's currently capable of laying down thin walls, like you'd see in a heat sink or heat exchanger.  Finally, the level of fit and finish you need to attach the pieces together in a proper watertight way means you'd have an awful lot of post processing work to do.

"So cost of ownership would be the printer, the consumables, and the furnace / kiln needed to fire the print. Depending on the type of metal you want to use will decide how to fire it. Also, if you bump the crucible things will shift a bit. if a binder could be added to to fix in place each layer that could work. It would not have to be much, like hairspray in a way. After each layer a thin coat of spray that will burn off during firing so it should not interfere with fusing the metal powder. Plus the burning binder will aid in preventing oxidation so things will fuse better. Just my thoughts on the matter.",-0.128,131
"So it could be described as a 3D printed sand cast that is pre filled with powdered metal. A rearrangement of the process of casting. You would still need a kiln to melt the powder but do not have to have a forge that produces molten metal.

It doesn't matter if something can be easily made, and it doesn't matter if people will ignore the laws. It is easy to kill people, and killers could give a shit about murder laws, but that doesn't mean we should make murder legal. 
Proper regulation would discourage irresponsible gun ownership, period. Even if someone breaks the law to have a gun, bet they would be more responsible when they have it, even if it is simply to prove that the laws are stupid.

I ran into this report while studying for certification in ""Dust Explosion Control"" through SACHE. Your machine might cause an explosion if you're not careful with the size of metal particle that you put in it. Both organic matter and metals can make dust explosions.",0.1421,130
it would be a lot fast if it was able to put sand and steel powder in there without always picking up a container. would be nice if the printhead could hold a certain amount of both ingriedients.,0.5994,40
it would be cool if they could make a software tool that makes cnc post processing very simple and streamlined.,0.3182,21
"it's only a matter of time before they have a machine that will make a completed solid part right at your desktop without any kiln or forging needed....

When that happens, look out, the world will change drastically (and not always for the better because you can bet people who have no legal grounds to own an automatic weapon will be printing them).",0.1779,69

print a hobby turbine engine with the metal printer.,0.0,10
really hope this technology takes off and we start seeing even lower cost versions of this.  I'd be curious to hear more about the kiln (I assume this has to be connected to a gas line)?,0.5095,40

idk how you gonna temper that thing

way better than plastic",0.5719,21

"sooo it's pretty much a sandcasting machine, interesting",0.7096,9
still easier just to use wax filament in a FDM and investment cast.  Metal printing is just not really effective without a 100w CO2 tube.,0.0075,27
this is so cool. if only i had a place for a furnace. I can see this coming in very handy for prototyping custom engine blocks.,0.2712,29
"this is what I'm into, love seeing new and accessible ways of sculpting metal
at my work I do some engraving, but we don't really do trophies and awards so much because of the amount of different stock / types / shapes of trophies. It's a bit too much for us. 

however, to have a library of trophy styles on a computer (which can be created/edited digitally) seems ideal to me - unique bespoke metal statues printed within a couple days. I've never in the past been convinced about the metal filaments for 3d printers - seems gimmick/brittle, but hopefully the tech is only getting better :D",0.9829,120
"while you can't use them inside, propane powered kilns/ovens are VERY cost effective to operate. I made one using plans from instructables for about $20.00 and to melt 4 lbs of aluminum, it costs about $3.00. 

It does get hot enough to melt light gauge steel, (I found out by accident) and I haven't tried any iron, or other ferrous metals though as I don't have a carbon crucible.

One thing with wax is then you'd need a heating element to liquify it during the ""printing"" process but if you wanted to make hollow parts, to save on your metal powder, you could simply design a drain hole in the bottom so when you fire it, it flows out. The problem though with mixing liquid wax with powder is the powder would get absorbed into the liquid wax.",-0.0537,158

otherwise, this is very exciting.",0.5413,22
would it be possible to use an induction coil around the crucible instead of a kiln.,0.0,17
would like to see how the printed parts look internally - and how much structural integrity is lost.,0.4215,19

wow! that is so awesome :) at 2k $ i would def get one but at 5k $ i think i'll continue getting cnc'd parts for now :/,0.5929,29
