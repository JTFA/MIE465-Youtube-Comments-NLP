American Idol hasn't really produced someone that big since Carrie Underwood either.  She was way back in season 4 and it went through 15 seasons.  There were a few past her but not many and most of the recent winners never released a record or had much success.  Will be interesting to see if that trend continues.  The Voice will need to have a successful winner (hoping Chloe can break out) or else they may lose the better talent to shows like AI where they have a better chance at promotion/exposure.,0.9904,100

"Dana you mean mean you think the producers didn’t want Blake to win again right? And yes I fell in love with Addison and Chloe, but in this case I was leading more towards Addison, but I really liked Chloe because she’s different and I really like different talent but however it’s getting boring when Blake keeps winning.

"Except the artists do the work for them so technically the show still focuses on contestant not coaches. The focusing on coaches is for entertainment and drawing viewership, same goes with judges on X factor and Got Talents shows too. The reason coaches are eager for great artist is to also leave a lasting reputation to themselves by making them superstars. Its a double win for both. If contestant is secondary, then coaches will not give a damn about the contestants let alone fans will not cheer for contestants.",0.9268,96

She deserve it and I'm happy for her but  I wish for a little bit of competitiveness... part Due because contestant gets eliminated.. but everyone was good... just more head head competition would be a dream. Where more contestant could be just as powerful to where no one knows who's going to win. Everyone was great and competed, after always watching the show I already knew she would win definitely after when Noah and the others got eliminated. (Anyways that just my opinion) everyone was great seriously and hats off the chole.",0.9894,150
HaleyVic17 yeah between this season and season 11 I thought had the best talent.,0.8481,16
"Honestly Brooke is very talented but she didn't really seem to define herself as an artist.  She could hit big notes but there wasn't the same connection that she had to the lyrics.  Chloe was the dark horse who sang her way into the live shows by delivering emotionally packed performances.  She didn't hit the big notes because she didn't need to.  And she stayed true to who she is an artist, making it very easy for the audience to connect with her.",0.9059,89

I actually felt bad for Ashland. The minute she chose Miley. How do you. Not go with Blake. She would probably be a superstar if she did. The man knows country music period. There is no country not to mention artist period. That's a better singer then he is! In my opinion! The people that don't pick Blake. Must not know what he is capable of.

"I am so happy Chloe won. Its refreshing to see a rock artist winning the Voice! Addison is also unique and Brooke is a powerful vocalist. Love the top 3!
Saw a lot of comments bashing Miley for letting go of the winner  😂. But I think its hard to predict the winner during the knockout stage, it could go either way.  (Adam DID let go of Josh Kaufman in favor of Delvin Choice in the knockouts too). I just wished she made her decision based on who had the better knockout performance (DEF Chloe did WAY BETTER than Ashland). This gives Miley a lot to think about. Although previous seasons have favoured pop, R&B and country artists as winners, I think she should have given more faith towards other artists with alternative genres too! (This season is a great example). Nevertheless, its a blessing in disguise for Miley to let go of Chloe so she can work with someone who has more faith in her artistry.",0.9951,191
"I don't like her at all...Her audition wasn't memorable at all...A lot of talented people didn't make it to the final because they didn't know hoy to play the game...This girl just won favoritism in the live shows because she looked commercial, because before the live shows her battle rounds didn't even have that amount of views... soooo.

"I personally think the voice sucked this year. I stopped watching half way through. Adam, who I normally think is so cool was WAY to RUDE to Jennifer Hudson and he could hardly contain his glee when Hudson's last voice contestant didn't make it through. You wonder why all the more dynamic voices were eliminated surprisingly early. It just appeared this whole season was one big set up. Two of Miley's contestants should have at least been a finalist.",0.5248,86
"I really don't think they wanted Blake to win again.  America fell in love with Chloe the response to her is HUGE and she happened to be on Team Blake.  In actuality she had a harder time in the finale because she also had Red from Team Blake to compete with and he was more likely to pick up the traditional Team Blake voters.  CHLOE won this, of course a big part of that was Blake letting her be herself so America could see how talented she is.",0.9586,93
I still don’t understand why Miley gave her up - to me she was the clear winner from the beginning.,0.7506,23

"I wonder who that Asian girl was around Chloe? Goodness, she was crying like she won the voice lol",0.836,21
I'm Back Sucka yeah that’s the funny part but I wonder if Chloe would’ve still won if she was with Miley for the whole time because seems like people vote for the coach instead of the real talent and seems like people like Blake a lot more than Miley and the nation didn’t want Miley to take in a win.,0.9812,67
I'm just going tobe honest. Chloe won before the finale and every coach knew it. Even fans of other singers! Why else would  start telling people not to vote for chloe. They knew their singers didn't have a chance. Addison was better than Brooke! Kiesha was better than everybody.,0.9126,56
"I'm literally crying because of my happiness. Since her first preformance with ""the chain"" I knew she's special, I've never supported anyone else but her and I'm out of US so it's hard for me to watch the voice even online so I watch everything only on yt and I was teling all my friends about her. I'm just in love with her voice and I'm so happy for her she's amazing OMG SHE WON!!!!!",0.9789,83

When I heard The results at the time. Because, He was My original first pick to win I was rooting for him Since The beginning When first audition & Sang ''Way Down We Go'' By Kaleo. Because, He was Unique & Different. Because, He did came up with The arrangement of The song choice He was going to sing Who does That??? All the years I been watching The Voice I never ever saw body like him before In the competition. Well, I knew somebody screw him over. Because, He did had more retweets on twitter compare of Red But He still got Eliminated anyway & I wasn't too sure Who It was That screw him over at the time By making look like Red got more retweets Instead of Noah &  If That's true producers votes??? NBC shouldn't let them to vote Then. Because, American suppose to be voting for The contestants Not The producers Not too sure Why Davon & Keisha didn't make It through to The finale Either at the time??? Because, They were My second & Third pick to win Since Their Blind Audition Ever Since Davon sang ''Me & Mrs. Jones'' By The Late Amy Winehouse & Ever Since Keisha sang ''I Can't Stop Loving You'' By The Late Don Gibson I was surprise They didn't make It through. Because, I think they both deserve to be there too at the time I felt bad for Jennifer though. Because, She look like She wanted to win too Either with Noah or Davon Besides Adam winning with Addison though. Well, Original Addison & Chloe were both on Miley's team But they both got Eliminated & Your right Addison was steal By Adam during The Battle Rounds  & Chloe got steal from Blake during The Knock Rounds But still I'm glad Chloe won She deserve to win. Because, She was another one That was different & Unique too,  She was My Fourth & Final pick Since The Blind Audition Ever Since She sang ''Chains'' By Fleetwood Mac But She definitely won me over Since She sang ''Landside'' By Stevie Nicks during The Knockout Rounds.  & She was the only one left That was different & Unique compare of The other contestants. Because, I don't find Addison, Brooke or Red different or Unique. Because, Their ordinary there's nothing special about them there are plenty of singers like Addison, Brooke & Red But there's not too many singers like Chloe Either Besides Noah. Well, This 13 Season Of The Voice Is over, Let's Just see What happens next season!!!",0.9673,557
"Jason Andolina Well, There was a couple of reasons Why Chloe won Instead Addison Number 1. Chloe had more votes compare of Addison The night before They crown Her as The winner, Number 2. Addison might of been Number 1 on iTunes charts  the night before But Chloe was Number 1 on iTunes charts three times In a row. Number 3. It was So Obvious The original song choice Chloe sang ''I Wish I Didn't Love You'' was 50 times better compare of Addison original song choice ''Tennessee Rain'' & 4. Another reason Why Chloe won Instead of Addison???? It's also Because, I guess people were really Impress with Her perform Since She sang ''Landside'' By Steve Nicks during The Knockout Rounds & Ever since Then She won them over & That's probably the only reason Why She won??? & I have to admit to you She did sang That song really good sounded like She was singing from the heart though. Anyway, I'm also a huge fan of Adam music too Well I'm Not too sure How He Is as A person In real life though Because, I only know him based on His music & Him as A coach on The Voice But as far as I know What I see on T.V.??? He seems like He Is nice guy funny too I actually get a kick out of him & Blake ever time they start to kidding around with each other!!!",0.9954,282

"Richard I get your point. This isn't the first time that a steal has won.  Moot. My point is that if you listened to the comments from Blake and Adam each week, you know that they were simply looking for someone they could promote to American Idol Kelly Clarkson level. 
I  just got the sense that they weren't  about finding and rewarding the best voices. It's about the Benjamins now. I was referring to the top 4 and not the top 10 finalists.

Um she is one of the most popular winners.  She set iTunes records during her season and had 3 songs peak at #1.

"We barely got any time for the announcement or celebration of the winner.  That was disappointing!  But Chloe totally deserved this win.   She kind of came out of nowhere and just blew America away.  If you listen to her post show interviews she put a lot of thought into staging, costuming, makeup and emoting the song.  I think the way that she draws you into the whole experience and emotes the song is what made her stand out.  Most The Voice winners have great voices, but Chloe is a great all around package.  I'm thrilled that she won and I hope she has a long career.",0.9811,117
"Well the show has never had a winner that has had much success.  They are going up against American Idol in the next season so they are promoting the snot out of Kelly Clarkson as a new coach.  But if they don't fix the problem that the contestants can have success outside of the show, those contestants might choose to audition for American Idol, or even The Four... the girl who is likely to win on there is already getting better promotion than the Voice contestants do.  And many in America obviously thought Chloe had the best voice, when she comes on the radio you will instantly know it's her... She doesn't embellish or run, and may not be pitch perfect... but her voice is distinguishable.  ""The Voice...""",0.8928,142

jillian balcazar yeah I thought for sure it was gonna be Addison too but I’m very happy that Chloe won because I knew since when Adam stole Addison and Blake stole Chloe that one of them were gonna win but I do feel bad for Adam cause you can tell he really wanted to win but maybe next season will be his season unless the producers rig the show so Blake doesn’t win again.,0.9774,79
jillian balcazar yeah I’m with you it’s getting boring when Blake is constantly winning but yes seems like Adam and Blake always has somebody in the finals but Carson said that Blake is 13 for 13 having someone in the final and Adam is 11 for 13 having someone in the final. And yes going to see Adam in concert is one thing you can’t regret cause I almost did and it was so worth not being able to hear right for almost a week probably cause the teenage American girls screaming constantly. So I’ll definitely go to another concert that Adam does probably when I can cause I almost went to the show here in Albany New York with a girl that asked me but of course we were unable to go since we both had to work at night that night.,0.9119,154
jillian balcazar yes I really started liking Chloe when she sang “Landslide” and I really like that song. And yes I only know Adam based on his music and him on this show but still the way he acts on this show makes me just want to hate him as a person but the relationship he has with Blake is so funny. And I have been to one of Adam’s concerts with the family we went to the last show before Behati had Dusty and it might’ve been one of the best concerts I ever been too.,0.9169,106
