"Eminem is such an disappointment as I grew up he was a role model to me. I come from a broken home too much like him so he become the mainly man figure in my life. He used to say he was an inspiration to kids. The kids that he used to rap about well, I was one of them. Much of my personality was developed by his way of act and thinking

But since his colab with rihanna Ive began to lose my admiration. I mean whats the difference between rihanna and britney  or cristina aguilera? He used to trash them so much then he goes and feat a song with the same kind of artist wich was despicable to him.?!

So I became more and more aware of his incongruence. Now he sings with beyonce! And ed sheeran... If he anounces a feat with taylor swift it wouIdnt be a surprise. 
I realize now that it was all just a show. Like that time he perfomed with elton john and said didnt known he was gay. I overlook so many things....
Honestly his last good song was Not Afraid and before that i cant even remember. His last good album was the eminem show since them he only came up with a few songs that was half good and the rest was totally shit.

How could he change so much? Oh and I realize now that being veracious like I learnt and was inspired by him wasnt that much helpfull in real life.   
And the worst of all is that he wasnt even like that it was just a caracter, he was just acting. Everything for the fortune and fame right?",0.9699,307

When I needed to use the churches hand for a job and my own life people only cared aout everything they are about now in my past and the future. I am well aware that it isn mt alright to ask the church for help everyday with this against the rest of society and waste their resources why you lie to them through new youth and get them caught up further. You all are that weight and always have been on the churches and don't get without you, we can't stop the television and things that make you miserable in this world. Wait not wait until Buddhists are settled the same way? You get the Idea? Yeah, that was from my life, but who did you hear it from or wo provoked from me instead of what I need to talk about. Make yourselves weight to this country, not me if you can't handle the truth. I know you are nothing to them without me, that's a problem I have with you not knowing Jesus for your own sake too! Stop attacking me over a life I am telling you that is true. It's not ""business"" for us. Really, when people are telling me that they know why I need to be inside in their way with me, and should help on their own hand. I don't feel alright with being outside begging or asking the church. Especially when their reasons are immaturity and sin in others. Not myself.",-0.649,293

"Lyrics :

[Ed Sheeran:]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Eminem:]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Ed Sheeran:]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Eminem:]
One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...

He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Ed Sheeran:]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Eminem (Ed Sheeran):]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Eminem:]
Always the bridesmaid, never “The bride, hey!”
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Ed Sheeran (Eminem):]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
