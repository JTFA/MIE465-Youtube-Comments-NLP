"I feel the man in blacks pain though! Years of coming to the park and yet the saloon gal treats you like a brand new newcomer. Perhaps facial recognition for each guest who has visited the park. After all, how else could one ever achieve legendary status such as a Jessie James or Billy the kid type status throughout the park with the hosts. Yes I know the hosts die often and reloop their roles, also I’m not sure the time limit per stay for the guests, but that saloon gal should be taken away by the man in black’s presence as should the rest of the bar. After all he’s been coming there 30 odd years and still gets greeted as a newcomer when the saloon gal
should have said something like “Well there’s a face I’d never forget, howdy mister!”  Also if you had a season pass and intend to stay awhile they should try keeping killed hosts out of your quests lines ect. If you in fact saw the host being killed that is! Also what’s keeping the guest from stabbing or shooting each other? I mean your first time there do you really know who is real and who isn’t? We can say special heat sensitivity type guns, but knives or any other sharp items? I assume this could be a bloody mess with court battles. I do feel the man in black’s pain and would push for total realism or at least on the brink of it! Haha 🙃 It doesn’t look like anything to me!",-0.9633,300

"i think this is all a euphemism for the far left's political agenda, or at least the radical feminist agenda (which is now somewhat mainstream, but still radical).  season 1 started very promising until it devolved into a blatant radical-feminism-revenge-fantasy, where most of the males are pathetic, weak or scumbags, and the females characters are strong, heroic,vicious warriors who 'wont take it anymore'.  In my opinion this hurt the overall story believability, and took away from what could have been great, even-handed storytelling.",-0.0799,100
