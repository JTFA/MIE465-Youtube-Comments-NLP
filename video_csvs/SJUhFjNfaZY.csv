Awesome! Way to deal with stress. When my babies used to cry for no reason (that I could figure out) I used to pretend I was listening to a mini motocross race. It was great. Just for the record they turned out great. : ),0.7263,52

"The score is amazing, it builds as we approach the devastation with the main character as he takes each step paced to the tempo of the beautiful piece he has begun to create. Turning his tragedy into something more palatable with an unexpected and oddly appropriate tune. It all ends as abruptly as it started, and you are left wanting more from both ends yet you don't pity him or his misfortune because of his good natured creativity that inspires hope. Even though the tune starts in a lamenting and mournful tone it leaves the viewer with a certainty that as his song transforms so will he through the hardship that has laid the foundation for his musical inspiration and subsequently his or now our personal growth. _/u/nostringsty_",0.95,139

My statement wasn't about the efficacy of a millionaire YouTuber's video on the trending page, and whether or not they should be ..nor did I express sadness. 
My statement was more so about the fact that the trending page *is* curated. 
Same could be applied to a Sargon of Akkad video not ending up on trending, when stuff like this is. And Sargon definitely isn't a millionaire.",0.3182,78
