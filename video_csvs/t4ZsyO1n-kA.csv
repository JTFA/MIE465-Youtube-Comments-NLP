"I somehow still love the way they are acting out, the same way I enjoyed Friends. I loved it more when their shooting doesn't go to plan and they f*** up, but they still included them in the show anyway. This has been the way the old top gear works, and the new TGT. 

But like every other TV show, they have a certain format, so when after doing about 20 seasons, some audience changed, and decided they didn't like it anymore. Just like the movie Airplane I&II. They have done the exact same stupid things in both movies, but scores on imdb are vastly different.

This is exactly what happened. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it whatsoever on being ""scripted"". It's just what it is, and my only suggestion to those crying ""scripted"" or predictable is, why bother? Just fuck off.",0.7905,171
