"If anyone still has the game, can you please time the length of the James TD review process? I feel like it was excessively long but I can't find the full game. I would argue, catch or not, the length of review suggests ""insufficient evidence to overturn""",-0.1779,54
"If the roles were revered you would hear Steeler fans saying, ""rules are rules"" however,  because they are on the losing end of the match they disagree with the call.

The bottom line is simple... Rules are rules! Whether or not the rule is a stupid rule is another story, but according to NFL rules the pass was incomplete.

Regardless of the pass the Steeler's had 3 more downs to win the game, and they still lost this game.

Say anything you want about the Pats, but don't say they are ""Lucky""!  You don't accidentally win 5 super bowls. You don't accidentally hold 85% of all QB Superbowl records. You don't accidentally rate in the top 3 categories in all QB stats career wise because you are lucky. The Pat's play at another level in big games in clutch moments. The fact that they intercept balls, and create turnovers in key moments during big games is not luck. They do this all the time! This team is seasoned. They never give up, and when they need big plays most of the time they get big plays form their BIG Seasoned Experienced players. While other teams play nervous this team plays with pose. This is why other teams give up the ball in big moments, and this is why the Pats don't. The difference between winning and losing Big Games is not only how you execute plays, but it is how you execute plays after difficult calls don't go your way. 

Furthermore, if the roles had been reversed, and Tom Brady had 3 more plays after the touchdown was called back, you would not hear Tom Brady complaining about the call because he would have won the game with the rest of the downs he still had left. 

This damn Pats team finds ways to win. If  Steeler fans want to get upset, be upset with your coach! Bottom line is this was their game to lose, and they lost it. Your coach made some bad calls in the 4th quarter that cost your team dearly.",0.9841,386

The steelers been super bowl champs since 1975 that's 27 years well ahead of the Patriots winning their first & still hold one more then them & possibly another here soon. üíØ so with the help of all these patriot refs & all these flags on the steelers almost every play i think you patriot boys need to relax & know your place in the NFL. & I don't even like the steelers!,0.9543,76
They do state otherwise. He was in the process of a catch which means you need to maintain control all the way to the ground. The ball came lose when he hit the ground. Per the rules it is incomplete.,-0.4019,44

"WTF... His knee hit the ground before the ball broke the plane. He had firm control of the ball (in both hands) when his knee hit the ground. So either way, it should have been Steelers ball on the 1 yard line. If the rules state otherwise, then the rules totally suck. Ridiculous!! That aside, why doesn't Tomlin kick the field goal and go into overtime at home? Ben should have never forced that throw.",-0.783,89

Well no since in arguing because that photo literally shows the ball sitting on the ground and his hand is not under it. You must be blinded by your love of the steelers but the call on the field was correct. Maybe be more angry that Big Ben hurled a ball into quadruple coverage after an obvious fake spike lol enjoy your offseason.,0.1557,66

"he had not been touched by a player. Your explanation only applies to a receiver after he has been touched by another player. The ground cannot cause a fumble (only after the player has been touched by another player).  The receiver had not been touched by anyone. Therefore, the receiver had a responsibility to complete the pass. In this case because no one touched him he had a responsibility to complete the catch all the way through to the end of the play. His knees and elbows have nothing to do with it.

For instance, If the receiver had caught the ball on the fifty yard line, and his elbow and knee had touched the ground the receiver would still not be down. He can get back up and keep running. Therefore, and elbow down, or a knee down is irrelevant. 

Even if a player passes the goal line with the football... if he has not been touched he must secure the ball all the way through to the end of the play. After the receiver caught the ball he stretched out over the goal line, but because he had just caught the ball he needed to secure it all the way down. The goal line caused the end of the play, but the receiver needed to secure the ball all the way to the ground. 

The ground cannot cause a fumble, but the ground CAN cause an incomplete pass. People are mixing up the two rules.",0.8957,273

"xMxH My coach? Lol, neither of these teams are my team.You can't say it's a rule when the exact same play has happened multiple times this year and was not called. Once again, the Steelers themselves had the same play last week. It has nothing to do with it being a ""dumb rule""; it's the refs ruining a football game and being the deciding factor when n that should NEVER be the case.",0.3182,82
"xMxH Of course you're going to say that. You're a Patriots fan. 

And No.  You're wrong. Wrong as always. Ball was caught, knee hit the ground, arms stretched out and goal line. Get over it. You got lucky and 90% of the world agrees. 

It doesn't matter what happened after. Especially when the same play happened the week before - by the freaking Steelers - it wasn't called incomplete. I like NE more than PIT but that was a catch and should have been a loss. Shotty how it ended really.

It won't happen again.",-0.6696,111
