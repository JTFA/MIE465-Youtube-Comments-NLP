"Abuse is a crime, and so is stealing the car. Crime is desire + opportunity. We can not eliminate the desire 100% (bad people will ALWAYS be there and it is dumb to expect that every single man will be a gentleman eventually). But, we can make sure that we do not provide an opportunity for those who have a desire.

I am not talking about cases when a woman walking home is getting raped. There is nothing she could do about that. I talk about specific cases when young girls being irresponsible end up having unwanted sex. Responsibility should go both ways - guys should not drink to the point they can not control themselves and girls should not drink to the point they can not make decisions.

If you provide an opportunity you should expect someone will take advantage of you. There is a difference being shut in the school, and being shut under the bridge at night alone. Rape is wrong. I do not have any tolerance to those who take advantage of another person but when I hear some girl telling she got when being drunk at the bar ... that is a stupidest thing to do if you care about yourself.",-0.9229,224

He was a real feminist, instead of telling me it was ALL my responsibility, because men just can’t handle themselves, he taught me that if someone thought they were entitled to my body just because I’m nice and pretty, I should be able to cause considerable damage. I tell you this because it’s a good lesson for your daughters... even women in burkas get raped, and 90% of the time it’s by someone they know, so teach your well covered up daughters how to pinch some dude by the peaches and throat punch.

I did fight, and I did escape, but when he was questioned... he was just going for consensual sex and I flipped out... he threatened to hit me with an assault charge.

"FlowerPower Saying that our movement is flawed simply because it doesn't explicitly mention men and trying to shift focus does, indeed, derail the argument.

It's essentially saying that because our argument isn't perfect, it isn't worth supporting. I know those aren't words you said or even your intention, but that's just an unforunate side-effect that comes about when you spring up with ""What about men?""

I also never said ""Only men should fight for men, and only women should fight for women."" What I said was ""When we're talking about the very specific script of sexual assault, perpetrated by men against women, it derails the conversation to insist upon bringing in the separate issue of other forms of sexual assault.""

By bringing up ""What about men?"" You're making this an all-or-nothing argument. ""Either we talk about men and women as both victim or perpetrator, or we don't talk at all.""

And I never said that inclusion was inherently bad. Just that it's presumptuous to assume that women are not including men in the conversation merely because they didn't mention male victims specifically, and that whether you like it or not, taking a video hosted by a woman about a book about women being victimized and trying to turn the conversation over to men, you're effectively saying ""Okay, enough about you, let's talk about men.""

I'm a huge advocate for men, and I'm all about stripping away all the things the patriarchy does that victimizes men, such as unfairly favoring women in custody battles, not believing men when they make accusations of rape or assault (especially against a woman), and forcing unrealistic roles of hyper-masculinity and toxic masculinity onto men. But this isn't the place for discussing that. This is a video specifically by a woman, about women, for women (to show men if they want to). 

Men and women should of course fight for each other, I never said otherwise, but they need to be focused on the same things at the same time. This is a video about women being victimized and assaulted by men at work and in public. That's where the focus should be. Similarly, I would never bring up ""Women are victims too!"" on a video specifically about how men are often not believed when they are sexually assaulted. On a video like that, the focus should be on male victims. 

And it's not a gender war. Feminists aren't mad at men (and anyone who says they are a feminist but hates men is not, in fact, a feminist) we are mad at the patriarchy. It's a war against the system, not against the opposite gender.

I never said your ideas were wrong. Just that this isn't the video you should be sharing them on, and that's why people are arguing with you.",-0.9935,538
"FlowerPower; Guess that's why sexual crimes persist, many men fail to see it from a woman's point of view.",-0.5423,22
"FlowerPower; It doesn't have to go one way. Women speak out about who hurts them, mainly men. Men can speak out about the women that hurt them as well and both sides can meet in the middle. You ask why men have to put in all the work? Well, right now it's mostly women putting in tthe work on this issue. We can't do it all. You want more representation for your group? Then you have to create it. Any person of color in the US can tell you that. There's not much point in protesting against someone's method of protest. Whatever men AND women out there that don't care for Ms. Ellis' book can write their own. Plus, she never said ALL men, not once. She said SOME. They always say SOME, and everyone knows that. Acknowledging that, however, hurts the naysayers arguments so they ignore that little detail.",-0.9457,175
"FlowerPower; Some people suck, women are part of people so, yes, some women are exactly as you said. So, while women fight for equality and equal representation (a thing we still don't have) we must also make certain not to upset and alienate those that have made said fight necessary? We must make sure to include them in all things in the same manner we have been EXCLUDED? We must give the men that harm us incentives to treat us as worthy human beings? We must understand that the centuries of mistreatment and denial of rights inflicted on women is equal to the occasional male bashing that results from women seeking human rights? Is that what you're saying? We must make certain that while speaking of the insidious, pervasive, and systemic disease that is sexual harassment and assult; that we don't hurt anyone's feelings? How, exactly, might one accomplish such a thing?",0.7051,172
"FlowerPower; Then why don't more men join the fight? If both sides can be victimized then both sides need to fight together. There is no perfect argument or method. Someone is going to find falut with your ways. Don't like her method? Then make a new one. I've learned you can't shut people up, you can only start speaking yourself. Get to it.",-0.8901,73
Francesca I think it's quite unfair to assume that I am somehow trying to silence you or your cause. I get it though I have my own opinions so I'm obviously an evil big baddy. Who says anything about fighting for everything at once? Isn't sexual assault sexual assault though? Yes because inclusion means silencing your side. Thanks for the advice. Changing one word means silencing. No one is more important than the other. Sure  you believe that? Women help themselves and men help themselves got it.

"GaryColeman70; Sure, there are better ways, but there is no perfect way. However, I cannot agree with you on your disbelief that society hasn't taught some men that such behavior is ok. It absolutely has, with centuries upon centuries of no accountability or consequences. Yes, some have been called out over our long history but not nearly enough. It was more to appease the outcryers then it was back to business as usual. My father was born in 1944 and he told me many, many, many times, ""many boys are taught that good girls always say 'no' before they say 'yes'. So some men will never care how much or in how many ways you refuse, so be careful.""",0.8131,143
"GaryColeman70; Yes, similar to how women are often made a mockery when they speak about harassment. Everything's not meant to educate, some things are for comfort.

"I think it's important to recognize that most women (at least the ones I know) UNDERSTAND that men can be victims of abuse (sexual or otherwise) and that men can be raped and are sometimes raped by women. However, what we also recognize is that men are statistically more often perpetrators and victims are statistically more often females. So most of the women supporting this book? Most of the women trying to fight for the right to NOT BE GROPED and harassed? We know it happens to men, too. We're not ignoring that.

But you can't fight for everything at once, and when we make the point that ""Hey, handsy men are a huge problem for us women and we feel unsafe in the workplace and in public because of it."" it's unfair for you to say ""Well, what about men? Men aren't always bad. Men aren't always perpetrators."" Like... yes. We know that. We never said that all men were bad and that no men are ever victims. You're effectively trying to silence our main point of ""Men groping women is a problem."" by saying ""Well, men getting groped by women is a problem!"" Yes. We know. But we're not talking about that right now. Its the same as if I said ""Hey, men groping women is a problem."" and you said ""Okay, but global warming is a problem!"" Yes, both are problems, but it's wrong to derail a discussion of an existing problem to bring up another problem.

We know men are victims to, and we're also fighting for them, but when we're focusing on the specific problem of ""men groping women"", that's what should be discussed. If you want to talk about the problem of women groping men, or men groping men, or women groping women (which are all valid problems) then you need to make your own post, your own video, your own book, your own whatever. That way you're rallying people around a specific problem WITHOUT SILENCING THE VOICES OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT AN EQUAL AND SEPARATE PROBLEM.

TL;DR, we know men are victims and women are perpetrators, but it's derailing the conversation to bring that up on a video about how men can and do violate a woman. They are separate problems with a common thread, and neither should be considered more important. No one should be talking over anyone else.",-0.9961,468

Rapists know rape is wrong. Do you honestly think we live in a society that doesn’t view rape as a bad thing? “Rape culture” doesn’t exist. Rape as seen as such a horrendous crime by our society that some woman will make a fake rape accusation because they know it will ruin his entire life. 

These sort of books are counter-productive. If you’re a victim of sexual abuse the last thing you need is someone telling you that all men are untrustworthy, uneducated fools that can’t seem to grasp the simple concept that sexually assaulting woman is wrong. It is important to feel comfortable talking about it.

The men have to see it from a woman's point of view but don't you think women should be making the same effort. Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine for once if you were a man.

"Mon Lemon I think most women understand this. That's why most have a professional wardrobe and a personal wardrobe. And yes even Amish girls get raped and sexually harassed. It's not right. It's disgusting. But why can't some men control their libido coming from a white lady sounds dumb. Hell even your teachers and husband's friends try to perv on you, it's easy to tame your libido when it flairs up. You have choices.  I can honestly say Ive never had a girl be a perv to me. Ever. Sure they hint. But it's not even close to what a typical girl encounters daily. So to ask why some ugly dude who hasn't touched a woman ever cant control his libido when some slut is flashing him the goods is silly. I'm not saying it's right. It just is what it is and women shouldn't be so up in arms. It's a fine line between flirting and sexual harrassment.",-0.7666,176

In all honesty those nice guys are normally the biggest pervs. But back to why some men find it hard to control their libido is bc they are bombarded by girls in short skirts who want the attention but then act like a man is a perv bc they look. Like I tell my daughters, dress for success. And be very open with how you feel. Guys are idiots. They can take miscues from the simpliest things.",0.9374,130

"Moni Muppet I absolutely agree it is a problem and also agree that a lot of times it isn’t taken seriously enough. I just find it an unlikely scenario that an offender is sexually abusing women because society has taught him that it’s okay to do so, and I find it even more unlikely that a sexual abuser will see this book, purchase it for himself and it will somehow convince him to stop assaulting women. I think it’s very important for victims of sexual abuse to be able to talk about it and for it to be taken seriously. I think depicting sexual abusers in the style of a children’s book in a condescending manner is not taking it seriously and that this is more of a comedy book targeted at women with ill-formed opinions of men rather than it being promoted as an educative tool for sex offenders.",-0.9524,164
Moni Muppet You are right. Many people do have not take it seriously enough. I mean America elected a man with a very relaxed stance on sexual harassment as their president.

It seems to make a mockery out of the whole thing to be honest.,0.5313,75

Answer me this though, How hard was it for her to use the word adults or people rather than men. That would have certainly made a difference. You don't kick someone who already feels down. Then why don't men join the fight? You sound like you think only men are the problem. How about meeting middle ground. You stop treating all men like criminals and they try to be understanding.

how would it be if you were to think about simply just asking for consent?  why is this difficult smh?,-0.5625,22

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
