"Dearest Lord Cockswain Bumblefuck,
I speak to you from my digital typewriter. I have inherited what appears to be a ""Chicago Wheel & Manufacturing Company Handee Rotary Tool"" following the passing of one of my grandparents and the subsequent posthumous garage cleaning.
As it turns out my great grandfather (I'm a 21yo fellow) used to use it to engrave his name on all of his tools and because it's old and old things are cool as fuck, I'd like to use it myself. Problem is it has a case of the quarter-turn fart lets the smoke out. Now I hearken back to your vijeos on the old skool drill, sawzall and dremel and dream that you might give this venerable tool the same treatment (of course, not so much ""chooch until dead"" and more of the ""frankensemble skookumfacturing"") so that I could use it for my mediocre desk-side metalworking.
As I said I can't tell you a whole bunch about the tool other than it gets hot quick, seizes up easy and smells like a hot damn bobs your uncle, but I can tell you that it's had a lot of relatively hot suppers and has been hanging out in a garage almost as long as my dad's been alive. Ferrous oxide dust!

tl;dr I got a cool tool and would like to send it to you to make a video off of and see if you can make it VERKZ once more or jury rig something together to give it the semblance of working. I'd be willing to drop a few dollars in the hat if that'd sweeten the deal, too.

Yours Truly, A Viewer",0.8884,305

They love getting dirty as shit with me in the shed (we calls it a shed here in Aus, not a shop) and the most mechanical of the two can hand me a 1/2 inch open-ender on demand 90% of the time. The other 10%, well, it could be pretty much anything but at least it'll be an open-ender.  The other twin is likely as not to hand you a hammer - which actually shows she's probably got the makings of an Underground Fitter right there.  They are great, I love the fuck out of having them out there with me and I could give less fucks about how much en-blackenned their little hands end up being - it's totally worth it and handing them back to their mother (yeah - that happened - predictably) afterwards and (not actually) listening to her bitching about how grubby they became is a soothing balm to my ears.
