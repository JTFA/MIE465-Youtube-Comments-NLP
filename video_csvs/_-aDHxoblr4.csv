"I dislike when science is portrayed as an absolute value judgement as opposed to just data. (Mostly because people are dumb.) Yes, driving distracted is unsafe. The problem is we value judge talking to someone ( via  BT, but manual dialed)  as distracted (and by extension illegal). However, we say the same or higher amounts of distraction are ok and legal; like driving while being the parent of a toddler or having a chatty passenger. It's a variation of the similar argument applied to vape vs. smoking.  Vape isn't safe (according to science), ignoring the fact that people are doing it as an alternative to smoking which is much more hazardous.  So, yes science can make a safe/not safe determination, but if those results have a logical point of comparison,  not including them presents the conclusion as a value judgement.  To say that distracted driving accounts for X percent of deaths becomes a biased statement, when you consider that it should be evaluated against the inescapable distractions average people face and instead be presented in subsets. Texting, talking to a camera, talking to a passenger, eating, smoking, manual vs automatic, etc.",-0.8415,226
