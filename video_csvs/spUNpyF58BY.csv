Maybe someone could help me out with one thing though, since it doesn't seem to be in the follow-up either: How, in this, would the phase-shift be represented? I have two ideas about what it could be, but I'm not at all sure about them:
1) it's the imaginary component along the y-axis
2) the amplitude is actually the length of the vector in the complex plane, with the phase represented as the angle of that vector. That makes more sense when trying to visualize the Inverse Fourier Transform, but in that case the transform would lose some of it's linearity if I'm not mistaken.
Also, a second follow-up that illustrates the IFT in this way would be super interesting.",0.9545,156

Try transforms in signals and systems by Peter kranauskis.,0.0,10
Trying my hardest to like this video BUT I think a much simpler intuitive graphical explanation is th think of the eiwt as 2 3d surfaces a coswt and sinwt surface. The even part of f(t) modulates the coswt surface and odd part of f(t) modulates the sinwt and we add up all the components of the modulated surface aoing get time axis to get the frequency content. No need for any moving images. The frequency and time domain exist and xan be seen in 2 3d planes. Also this approach answers ALL Fourier transform properties. Sorry ladies and gentlejen this approach talking about centre of mass is just to contrived for my liking.

Fortunately, I am quite familiar with the Fourier Transform. I've already used it often, and even programmed ... But, the lower left part is a visualization that I did not know, even if it reminds me of another ..
