Ed Sheeran is one of the funniest people I have seen in the last 20 years in the music industry.  I am so glad he has a girlfriend and that he is doing so well with song writing.  I have all of his CDs amd really enjoy them.   I am an older woman of 70 so I am not a young fan.  I think he is the best singer/songwriter of his generation.,0.9512,79
"Ed Sheeran is such a humble guy, I love his openness and transparency. Ed will you support those who have permanent arm damage who are dependent on others to help: wash, dress and feed them? Those who have lower limb damage are supported extensively, but people with upper limb damage much less so. And yes I am one of them.",0.2783,68
