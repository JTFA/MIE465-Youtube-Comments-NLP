"The Lord Jesus is coming, friends! 

Jesus loves you! He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

The Lord came down from heaven to die and rise again for us all, this alone speaks volumes of His Conditional Love for us all!

John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved the world, He gave us Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have life everlasting! Hallelujah!

So friends, repent and put your faith in Jesus! 
He will deliver you from your sins, He will wash you and make you clean! This is what He has done in my own life. I have experienced this love on my own! It's something that cannot be taught, but must be experienced by trusting in The Lord. 

John 6:37 (paraphrased) also says that Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so friends, you have nothing to be afraid of. Seek The Lord today! You'd be glad you did! 

He will make a Way to escape the Judgement headed towards this ungodly earth. He already has, since He took our punishment upon Himself on the cross!

Please accept this Great Sacrifice, this Great and Wonderful Gift from God! 
All you need is faith as the size of a mustard seed, and words that come from the heart. Call upon Him today, you will be saved!

Shalom, my friends.",0.9981,276

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
