"A lot of people here who know how to drive stick buy autos anyway because they're more common, they get better gas mileage these days, and they're often faster in a straight line. They're also easier to drive and considered more luxurious. Then kids never learn how to drive stick because there aren't any cars to learn on in the family. Consequently, manufacturers make less manual cars because the market shrinks even more. It's a self perpetuating cycle. The only people choosing manual cars these days are enthusiasts.",0.8402,97

"I think what is so enjoyable about the movie is that it kind of took an age old concept of the heist movie with all of the typical archetypes and modernized it in a really unique and stylish way. 

The movie takes place in modern times, but it has a very retro-soundtrack and a classical filmmaking approach (carefully blocked scenes, not a lot of handheld, long takes, etc.) As far as the characters go, they all fit really stereotypical molds, but the performances were pretty well-done. 

Ansel's performance as Baby, from what I've seen, is very divisive in its reception. Some people felt that he wasn't acting ENOUGH, and some people feel that he really encapsulated the personality of someone who has been through a lot of trauma and is very quiet -- though his eyes tell a lot (which is why I find it interesting that he's always trying to wear glasses too... it's like he wants to be completely shut-out from the world). 

All-in-all, I think why the majority response to the film is so overwhelmingly positive is that many people were probably expecting something akin to another Fast & Furious or similar high-octane car chase blockbuster, but instead got a more reserved, stylish, character-driven heist film.",0.9382,234

"There are some unique elements but only babys character - everything else is exactly what you'd expect it to be

I liked the soundtrack and while what they did technically is admirable  - story is what keeps me invested not blocking but I do enjoy the long takes.

His performance I thought was good for what the script required but not a globe nomination worthy - big awards award performances based on how good a movie they percieve it to be or if it tackles  things like being gay , black or some disease  - you're right about the glasses aspect 

I wasn't expecting a Fast and Furious ( I don't like most of them ) ... I was expecting a  signature edgar wright quick comedic  cus not some movie that felt brandless and cheap - it didn't feel like edgar wright",0.9901,143
There are some unique elements especially with Babys character but that's about it  . As for the technical side of the movie- I admire the effort but I care more about story - honestly every action movie I see is copy  paste and I don't care at all if I don't care about the characters . It was a good  performance and he did what he need I'm just saying that the big awards don't  choose performances based on actuall performances but rather on  what the movie is which is a backwards way of looking at it .  I didn't expect  a fast and the furious movie ... I expected a great Edgar Wright movie filled with his signature quick comedic cuts not this ultra regular american movie that you can't even tell it's Edgar Wright,0.9868,137
