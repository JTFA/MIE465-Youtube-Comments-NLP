Kim wants nothing to do with this anymore, just listen to her interview with Pearce Morgan. Since the majority of the population wants another movie (including me) suggesting a way around such an iconic character is the only way forward not because fans like me don't want her back. Got to respect Kim's decision. Apart from that, Personally I did suggest another option too which is the lesser of 2 evils in this situation. It goes without saying that the movie will be not be the same without her. Either way it's a difficult one for them. Hope they find a half decent solution.",-0.2805,160

They should not replace Kim at all but rather carry on with their own story line between Carry, Miranda & Charlotte.

The show is about 4 women in NYC.  3 women won't work, much like setting in the middle east didn't work.
