"Komic Klepto because for years and years up until the 80's/90's i think, no one else on the show could see him/hear him and no one believed big bird when he would tell them about his friend snuffleufful..whatever.  That changed during to a campaign at the time about kids not always being believed by adults when they try to say they were molested and such. They wanted to promote that kids should be believed so they started making snuffleguy seeable by everybody. That does make it an outdated joke though",0.1779,104
