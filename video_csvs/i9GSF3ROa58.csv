Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home

Many of us lefties do like her but a lot just see her as the lesser of two evils. I don't think Hillary is a good person but at least she isn't racist or islamophobic and actually knows about politics. but hey if you want to defend your president thats your business. but no we don't see her as a hero we just dislike her less than we hate trump. Im not trying to be rude I'm just informing you of the facts (a bit like trump himself needs to be amirite XD).,-0.3344,100

"Matty Kal Ramone Man they were definitely emo tinged on that album. Like boulevard of broken dreams and jesus of suburbia had that feel to it. Obviously they weren't all taking back Sundayesque but I know a lot of emo folk at the time who loved that shit but hated the older records. 
AI was a good album don't get me wrong, but I still go back to  kerplunk and dookie etc when I want to hear green day.",0.5692,84
