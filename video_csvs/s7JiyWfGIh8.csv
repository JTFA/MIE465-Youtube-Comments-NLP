"...GS was hell on my quads, but not so much knees.
*A Benavidez,* A big part of training for GS is about initiating the turn before you're actually in it. There are also _dozens_ of leg exercises done off the mountain.
*RIPPEDDRAGON40k,* I really love your description of, ""you feel like you are on rails that you laid yourself."" You really do! I don't know if people who have never raced GS can imagine the _extreme_ sensation of pressure as you _push_ through a turn and your racing edge bites into the snow through the turn. There's also that weird feeling of being held up by the edge of your ski's lateral G-Force and that if your slice loses pressure then you'll slip out on your side. The only thing that ever alleviated my nervousness about that was spending hours of careful sharpening and waxing on my own skis, never letting anyone else touch them if possible, and guarding your racing edge like a pet and only using it to race.",0.3573,193

"A Benavidez Exactly. Society has decided that even if a woman didn't appear offended and said nothing about it, she could come out years later during an ""in depth interview"" and express that it was ""uncomfortable to me"", the rest of the left will scream sexist and worse. One cannot predict to know the mindset of feminist whom are pushing for "" Next day non-consent"". That is where a women agree to intimacy  one night but the next day, maybe they feels social anxiety about it, maybe because her friends are judging her choice of men she chose the night before to be with. So she than says, "" I withdraw my consent because .. blah blah blah, than it can become rape in their eyes and in the eyes of the law. .. Woman when they might feel some regret about a one night stand, feel bad because they feel they've given up power, or it was ""taken"" from them, even by their own consentual decision to be intimate with that person prior. And accusations, and Next day non-consent is in their minds a way to get that power back. Almost like a form of ""social justice redemption"". 

So your life than is in the hands of a person whom holds social media judgment more important than you losing your entire reputation, job.. and possibly way more.. Men have been convicted of this. 

I am in no way saying Shiffrin is one of these woman that condone that, but can you predict in 20 years when the lime light is gone and her mindset changes just like everyone else's that she wont? Even if she only says "" i was not deeply offended but it was uncomfortable"" , the rest of society, especially the left will crucify you as a rapist..or very well could.",-0.9085,342

Jesus also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him. (John 6:37 paraphrased) 

So my friends, don't let anyone stop you from coming to Jesus! God is FOR us! He is NOT against us. 

If you feel He is sending you away, know that it isn't Him that is making you feel unwanted, it is the devil. 

Jesus is calling everyone home! Hallelujah!

I pray you respond to this Calling, and make Jesus your Lord and Savior. You don't need a fancy prayer, simple words from the heart will do. You also don't need a lot of faith, The Lord can work with a mustard seed size faith. 

Repent of your sins, and put your faith in Jesus. 

He will help you! 
He will forgive you, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

He is not expecting you to clean yourself, He will do it. So come as you are today, and allow Him to wash away your sins. Hallelujah!
