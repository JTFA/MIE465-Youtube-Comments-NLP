So, while in training camp he learned absolutely nothing? You know, the New England Patriots have a history with turning (((WASH-UPS))) and (((SCRUBS))) into *super-stars...* (Not saying Jimmy. G was a scrub or washed-up athlete).

This for a example: If the New England Patriots haven't drafted him would he be any better he is now? Well.. would he? Probably not... I believe the *greatest coach, QB, owner, organization* had an amazing affect on him. 

Don't believe me? Well, look up the 49'ers victory over the TT); Then you will see how much they all have helped him develop. (Look up the interview, after last weeks game).",0.7812,152
"Amethyst The Darkrai 

Sorry, didn't know you were referring to the comment I made.. ""Rotting on the bench."" So yeah, again, my bad. Just read over it way too fast. But only playing 4 games with the talent he had was redundant. He was with us these past two years.. (Wish I've seen more of him).
