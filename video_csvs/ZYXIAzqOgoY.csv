And they still don’t do a colour pale enough for me their lightest concealer is like a bronzer/contour on me and looks stupid. They only go to light skin tones and ignore the truly fair skins and truly dark skins.,0.5719,46

Came here to see wether I should purchase or not. Honestly I’m a fan of Tarte because they are a vegan 🌱 cruelty free company. I was disappointed because of the lack of shades and wanted to get opinions however not many people were doing videos on performance. So I appreciate you talking about the performance of the foundation as well as your skin type. I’m also dry skinned so it was nice to hear that you were leaning towards the matte even with dry skin. I’ll be tuning into more of your videos.,-0.315,106

Don't like the foundation wand idea.. I feel like there'll still be product in the jar/bottle but you won't get much out! Pumping bottles are way better! These things are soo expensive man and not fair that you will have hard time getting the product out! Ugh! I'll just wait for some new foundation to launch...,-0.7328,64

Hmmmm lots of shades for light skin and only 2 for dark skin. what about people like me with tan/brown skin?? there are literally no option for us.,0.168,34
"Honestly the both look fantastic, I like the matte but, I think what you're seeing us the dewiness, so I'd love, love, LOVE, if you'd do the matter with drops of the dewy one...I'd love to see that🙌 also I'm a tarte freak..anything tarte, but I took had bad skin when younger, but it only shows if I use foundation😠😩😶 that's my fav part, and I just can't use it, no matter which kind, it sits wrong, it shows, texture, texture that I can't see/find with clean skin, so I tried bb , and ppl say I look airbrushed, so even tho I'm sad abt the no foundation, at least Bb cream looks great...my point?...my point is, is I've literally have tried close to 20 BB creams, from Laura Mercier, to tarte, tinted moisturizer, and their BB cream..and I don't like them as well as the it cosmetics, CX cream...or the purlesse ..maybe since you have grt skin you could do a look with bb cream, or try all the tarte ones, see if they have I new one...idk...im gonna stop rambling now lol😘",0.9876,234

"I accidentally came across your channel ..... Out of all the ""New Foundation"" ST reviews..I have enjoyed yours the most. I am glad Tarte is going to have more shade ranges.  Tarte is my favorite .... Thank God they are trying to correct this awful ordeal.  I believe Tarte does care about SKIN...but no matter the color everyone wants to feel beautiful.   I will not support IT cosmetics anymore because of their lack of shade ranges... I do not understand.. If you want to set yourself apart and be the leader then allow every skin color to follow 💋",0.8983,111
I agree and disagree. I agree it is frustrating that there is only two shade for the dark skin tones but I also disagree because I am a super pale human and most foundations oxidize orange and yellow on me and I see shades that might actually work on my skin tone. Please take what I say very lightly I'm just starting to really get into make up. I haven't really tried before because as I said. I'm super pale and everything tends to look orange or yellow on me. I really do hope they come out with a part two as big of a range for darker toned people. That would be really fluffen cool :),0.9751,123
"I agree what they did was messed up. My best friend is a POC. It's garbage. But this is her job. And as she mentioned, it's important to bring attention to the shade issues but that does not mean those who want to enjoy it have to be excluded. That ruins the argument of inclusivity. It shouldn't be I can't have it so you can't either, it should be yes you have it but it's WRONG that they couldn't have it for me as well and we need to do something about it.",-0.3505,102

Kinda felt like you added in the shade range controversy so you wouldn’t get dragged for supporting or showcasing this foundation knowing that they catered to lighter skin tones first. “Our” being left out of this product line isn’t a disclaimer you insert for views then go ahead as say how you love it and how you will be using it ... then ask us to leave a comment on which side of your face we like the most Hahahaha I’ll let you know how I liked it .... oh wait I can’t ....,0.9176,105

I am a nail artist myself and I feel like these are just the wrong shape for your fingers. I mean, yes, nails are completely personal preference. But whoever does your nails should also know when to use which shape and when not. A square shape looks gorgeous if you are sporting shorter nails. But not in this length. Please don't take this personal in any way! I just couldn't keep silent. 🙈",0.8065,109
