"I'm not sure if I'm right, but wireless charging is inefficient for phones and small devices, but on par or even better than wired charging for huge, massive batteries like those found in Tesla.

One of the reasons quoted is that for the charging to be safe and battery current level properly managed at all times, high-power load stabilisers and surge protector have to be used for wired charging, thus reducing its charging efficiency for a huge battery. This means that wireless charging, since it is inductance based, has less vulnerability towards current instability, making complex electronics for power supply unnecessary. 

I'm going to find a source for this, but I have heard this theory somewhere, especially for electric cars.

if your charger jack broke and its too expensive to repair use the pad,-0.4215,14
increase the range to the inductive charging to the point that the whole building is a charger and then people will care to expand on it. not just the tech but also on the new ways to power it .,0.5267,41

"liked the video but personally as a physicist i find wireless charging to be too wasteful in terms of efficiency that can't be physically increased too much beccause you are making waves that propagates in the space, meanwhile the charger is a diret link",0.4458,45

"my usb port broke on my phone, so instead of buying a new phone or fixing it, which would cost a couple hundred dollars, I just bought a wireless charger for like 40-50 bucks. so wireless charging saved my phone's life, for now at least",0.4144,50
"no thanks, I'll drive my ownself.  no suiicid box for me.  driving is a pleasure not a chore. autonomous cars eliminate freedom of choice and chasing rainbows , lost dogs, or going camping. probably one of the worst ideas ever.",0.25,47

"pretty sure i read not too long ago that the efficiency problems are only for low-power devices, and high power inductive transfer such as in electric cars gets better than 90%.",0.802,34
shut the fuck up and cold open with your point cunt no one cares about numbers and a fucken story and shit i just want to know the truth about wireless chargers like fuck,-0.836,34

"this video wasted 4 minutes explaining the technology on a useless level, then spent 6 minutes throwing around random numbers for power usage by smartphones and then randomly swung into the topic of EV-s. inductive charging for ev is cancer. you either have to keep 2 plates so close that a wired connection is better and cheaper, or far apart enough that the energy losses are unacceptable",-0.9022,71

why not use a battery inside every inductive charger? to reduce electric cost,0.0,14
