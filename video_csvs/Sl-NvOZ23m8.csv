"...Help? I really need another opinion on this... I've identified as a lesbian for a few years now, but I'm doubting myself. One of my guy friends is doubting me, making me doubt myself. Long story short, he's had a crush on me for about 7 years. He's a good guy, he was actually kinda cool with me when I came out. But after a while he told me I didn't have ""lesbian traits"" or I didn't ""act like a lesbian"". I keep on getting confused. I know I like girls, but am I bi or pan? I haven't felt a crush on guy, but I used too. I'm not sure if I changed or I kept on faking being a lesbian until I became one. I don't know. It was so clear before but now I'm all messed up. Any advice? I'd love it! And please please please be honest, not just what I want to hear. Thanks!",0.919,188

I am really so proud of ur growth and so thankful to have found ur channel 🙆🏻 It srsly warms my heart everytime I watch ur videos and see u answering gay questions, recommending gay films, supporting the community and just being one amazing human <3 I wish for u oy to soar higher and become even more comfortable with urself (everything abt u <3) and to all my LGBTQ+ friends out thr, pls know that u are not alone in this, thr are many like u and many willing to support u.

"ConnorFranta From the moment I read Note to Self I was hooked. I wanted to see who this Connor Franta was. I didn't know squat about his youtube channel. I just knew he had changed something in the way I viewed my life. At that moment I started forcing myself to be alone and finding things that I liked to do for me. I had lost who I was as a mother, a girlfriend, I had no individuality. So I searched. My family allowed me this time. I now know I love reading, coffee dates, doing puzzles, cross stitching, movies, cats and dancing. I do not like driving in the snow, loud noises, and grocery shopping. I have changed life perspective, began thinking out of the box, got sober, and started to be a more healthy person. It all started with 1 book. I hope 1 day he comes across this a nd realizes his story touches people and encourages them to also become self aware. It takes hard work but it can be done. ❤",0.5982,202
"ConnorFranta I definitely feel the same way! I just wanted to tell you that one can see your change of confidence and comfortability in your kind of videos. 
I also came out as bisexual almost three  years ago and it made a huge difference in my life. Good and also bad ones. But either way I don't regret coming out because it is easier to talk about... Literally everything now and that's what I think you went through too!

"Hey Conner! I started high school this year and it's pretty interesting. Recently I've been getting some negative comments and remarks from my dad. I'm still questioning and explore who I am. My preferences and gender orientation. Now, I beginning to feel uncomfortable being identified as a female. I don't mind everyone else who thinks so, except for those stereotypes that pop up sometimes, but it mostly bothers me coming from my dad. ""You can't wear that, it's for guys."" ""You got to know sometimes, that you are a girl."" It's just frustrating hearing him say these things. At an age where i have to motivation to try new things like a short guy length haircut style. I think it'll be fun and plus side easier to take care of. But he shut me down. I was planning to grow it out and donate it to cancer charity too. He did threaten once that he kick me out as i argue back. He says he raised me like a girl, but I wanted him to raise me for me not my biological gender. I'm just in a spiral of frustration. Whenever I get girl stereotypes thrown at me, I get a little annoyed. When there are mentions of gender I get a little agitated.",-0.5366,244

I do consider we have to talk about inequality and all those topic that concern us as part of a huge society, but i think you make some kind of an unnecessary exageration out of it. 

Making something normal implies talking about it with as normality as possible, making a whole thing out of it, a video about how hard coming out was for you, how many years have passed since, how important that step was and all that, is helpful sometimes, but be careful, i think you're confusing encouraging with overwhelming, which is, according to my own experience, even more painful and difficult than simply ignoring those topics and bringing them the normality they implore.

I don't know if i made myself comprehensible, anyway, i'm free to listen to new and different opinions and eve change my current one.",0.2535,195

I live in a small town in southwest Georgia and well not everyone is accepting and not a lot of people know about the lgbtq+ community. also a few people have came out to me and only me just because they felt comfortable with me and knew that i could relate in some way.

I became even more depressed than I had been and only recently (October) I told my parents I'm depressed, so now I have medicine, and I'm working towards getting better, but that memory of my parents not believing me, and just knowing they never will, it makes me so sad.

I met you on your tour for your second book in Palo Alto, and I left a drawing with a letter on the back for you explaining my life and your part in keeping me alive. I also told you face to face that I struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts and that you were the reason that I lived past 13 all the way to 17(and counting). You helped me come to terms with my pansexuality and being gender fluid, which let me tell you is quite hard. It was through you that I came to the realization that I was finally, truly happy not too long ago, for the first time in my life. You are my savior Connor, and I will always love you for that. you taught me to be myself, and that it is okay to do so. I am now proudly an emo, punk, tattoo loving, emotional, loved, sarcastic, teenage, pansexual, gender fluid high schooler who will forever be confident in who I am. I am sorry for how scattered this is, but that is just how my brain works. I will forever be thankful that I discovered you online and got the chance to meet my hero in person.

"This year I really started to like my natural face without makeup, so I started going to school with no makeup on and my friends called me a few weeks ago and told me I should change myself to be like them because I hadn't been trying hard enough to look good and that they want to climb the social ladder. Last year I would've bended under their will, thinking something was wrong with me for not wearing makeup, but I told them I wouldn't ear makeup for them because I've changed this year and am finally comfortable how I look no matter how much makeup I wear. It's great :)",0.9559,116
"To be honest, you are a representative for the LGBTQ  community in the world. Connor, you have inspired gay (LGBTQ) people, such as myself, to live to our fullest potential. Your name has come up on almost every gay date I've been on. Thank you, Connor, for the positivity you have inspired in our community. ",0.9382,68
Today is the three year anniversary of Connor's coming out and each year I watch the video and cry all night long I think it's my favorite tradition cause I love Connor so much and it just makes me so happy for him,0.8702,43

"Watching you really makes my day.
Thank you :-)",0.5859,10
"We have the same feeling actually. Cause I came out to myself, 3 years ago and I came out publicly the next year... Then those gay things I really don't wanna talk about, I really have a huge interest about it right now and I encourage my not-officially-come-out friend to know who they are and what they feel and stuff like that.",0.9365,67
"Well i was that person who hated her guts, her soul, her body, everything..literally. And now after just one year i have become the person who is completely extraverted and in TOTAL LOVE with herself..so yea i can realate to what you said in a way!!",0.5294,56
"Went for the LGBTQA annual Pride Parade in the city I now live in,this year althought I don't identify with it and it was one of the most positive,vibrant and warm environments I have been in.So much love and kindness,such beautiful people and such fashion.Everybody was complementing each other,smiling and wishing each other happy pride.Have never felt as fearless in such a big crowd before.Was telling my mother about it on the phone later,the same day and she asked me why I needed to go and I said because everybody should be able to love who they want to and she understood.The font you used in this video is very pretty but vanishes too fast to be able to read it (was that deliberate?)",0.9086,137
"Whenever I explain things to people one of the most important things I say is that I don't know or understand everything queer and they don't need to either. However, respect and equality of someone else is not dependent on your's or anyone's understanding of them.",0.6361,49

"You are such my inspiration. Soon it'll be my 3 years aniversary of my diagnosis -anorexia and depression- and I really get upset when this time is comming because I feel I didn't do any step forward. But you have made me see that now I know a lot of about mental ill people commumity that I didn't take on account before and I am by far more confident explaining people how to include us (mentally ill people) and notice us. I think I am doing a pretty good job in my environment teaching other ones about these topics, which in my opinion are super necessary for a future tolerant and perfect world. Also you have given me hope -you don't know how you will be in three years from now, so maybe I will have been recovered, for this reason I'm keeping fighting 💪",0.8982,157

"almost two years have passed.. i suddenly became curious about connor and decided to check out his channel. it made me glad to see that he was still making videos (aesthetic af videos im not surprised) .. and the fact that he seems so lively and content, it makes me more than happy. i missed his channel, his intros, his outro song, his beautiful smile.. im relieved that it's still all the same after many years. but his videos are so raw and different to how i last remembered them, and i love them even more. you, Connor regained another dedicated viewer. (:  i regret not returning sooner, i missed this channel a lot more than i thought i did.",0.9534,137

i've become the go to in my group for most things happening now-a-days. anything from lgbtq+ to what the new tax plan was all about. my friends always ask me about current situations.,0.4767,37
"i've had a similar realization before! i joined the internet at an earlier age than my friends and found literally a whole other world of knowledge about lgbtq+ and feminism and found myself so interested and intrigued so i read more and more so when my friends were ever a little out of bounds i would tell them something just to help them understand and now i have become sort of a ""guru"" of information for my friends on such topics and i'm just really glad i can do that for people so i definitely understand! 💛",0.9715,102

"ive been out for less than a year, but one of my friends/teammates asked me if i could talk to one of her friends that just came out to her. ive never met this girl before but she thought she would benifit if i talked to her because ive experienced coming out and that was just such a full circle moment. like i could use what ive been through to potentially help someone else and thats just so amazing.",0.9625,85

omg i remember the day you posted your coming out video! i was at school in seventh grade and like we weren’t allowed to have our phones but i peeked and saw that you posted a video called “coming out” or something like that and we were in theater club so me and my friend like snuck out and went behind the building to watch it and we were crying so bad that like we had to sit for a while and gather ourselves before we went back inside,0.5726,94
"so i got a haircut from a new hairstylist and she asked me why i cut my hair so low and i told her i was trans. she asked me if it was ok to ask when i knew i was trans i, of course said yes and explained it to her . idk it felt nice? i’ve never just up and told a complete stranger i’m trans.",0.3525,76

"this video hit me really hard, I only recently came out fully to my parents and friends, I used to live in New York but four years ago we moved to Memphis Tennessee, and the reactions I have gotten from each part of my surroundings have been...varied. It's so crazy to be so open and sharing and accepted in one sphere of my life, when I'm in New York there is no hesitation in expressing myself, but when I'm in Memphis, I have to do a complete 180 and hide and cover a lot about myself because of the extreme prejudice I face, either way this is an amazing video and it gives me so much hope for the future. <3 love is love",0.965,135
