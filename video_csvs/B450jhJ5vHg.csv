"Matthew Morris McCormick these was a hot fix pushed out recently. 
What you want to do first is to manually change your date and time on the device facing the issue to any other date. I have heard that setting it to a prior date is supposed to help. 
After doing so, the device should stop restarting after a certain amount of time. 
The next step would be to instal the latest version of iOS 11, as it is supposed to fix this bug. 
The last step would be to change your Date & Time settings to be updated automatically. 

I hope I was able to help you resolve this issue.",0.8779,120

"Zuan Ted exactly. I have been using iOS devices for years now, but just lately did I find myself to struggle with the native Mail app and the option to attach files or photos to an email, therefore I saw myself forced to use third party apps for sending emails with my various accounts. 
I usually try not to rely on their party applications, but in this case I had to. 
Apple should make iOS more intuitive again and maybe wait with implementing more and more features each year.",0.0387,96
