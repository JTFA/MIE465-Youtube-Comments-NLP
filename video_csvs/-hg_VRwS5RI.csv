"""Are you...

...vegan? 
Do not vaccinate! Vaccines have animal byproducts in them.

...pro-life or Christian?
Do not vaccinate! Vaccines have aborted fetal tissue in them.

...pro-choice?
Do not promote mandatory vaccines! That is hypocritical if you believe we should have choices in our medical decisions.

...immunocompromised? 
Do not vaccinate! Vaccines can contain live viruses and can make you very sick. They also cause auto immune diseases so could make you much worse (or could have been the cause of your issues to begin with).

...healthy?
Do not vaccinate! They cause many chronic health conditions and spread the very viruses they are supposed to prevent.

...pro-organic food?
Do not vaccinate! Vaccines have glyphosate in them.

...concerned about your child's health?
Do not vaccinate! Vaccines have been directly linked to outbreaks of the very infections and viruses they are supposed to prevent, allergies, eczema, autoimmune issues, asthma, type 1 diabetes, juvenile arthritis, and SIDS (and much more).

...allergic to anything?
Do not vaccinate! Allergies can be caused by vaccines and if you are prone to developing allergies it will only get worse.

...elderly? 
Do not vaccinate! Your immune system likely won't even form any sort of benefits to the virus due to your age, and could make you very sick or kill you. The flu shot is directly linked to Alzheimer's.

...aware of a MTHFR mutation in your DNA?
Do not vaccinate! Your body has severe issues detoxing and vaccines have an incredibly high amount of toxins in them.

...not aware of your MTHFR gene status?
Do not vaccinate until you get genetic testing to make sure you aren't at higher risk for severe adverse reactions! (There are other gene mutations that are also linked to this that they are still discovering).

...a firm believer in science?
Do not vaccinate! Scientists are still learning just how dangerous vaccines can be and how the immune system works. The non-biased, independent scientists have always been able to prove vaccines are dangerous, but we find out more with each passing year.

...pregnant or hoping to become pregnant soon?
Do not vaccinate! Vaccines have never been tested for safety or efficacy in pregnant mothers and they are showing correlation with an extremely high risk of miscarriage and spontaneous abortion.

...from African American descent? 
Do not vaccinate! Watch Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe. You are at an increased risk of autism and other adverse reaction after vaccination.

...Asian?
Do not vaccinate! Look up how scientists left out statistically significant data regarding the odds of death in Asian women after getting the HPV vaccine.

See where I'm going with this? NO ONE should vaccinate. 
Because EVERYONE is at risk.""",-0.979,513
