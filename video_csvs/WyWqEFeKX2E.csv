However, as a person of faith it heartened me to see glimpses of religious statues, beads, holy water, a shopworn Bible and organ music.  In Jack's bio it is reported he once considered entering the priesthood but music won out in the end.  I see glimpses of Jack's own spirituality through these video snippets.  I will look forward to hearing the other cuts on his new album BOARDING HOUSE REACH.",0.8316,124

This is a song that grew on me even though I was trying my hardest not to let it with that being said Jack White is the man no denying that.

I have been a fan since I was 14 years old (that's exactly for 14 years now), but never got the chance to see you perform live! Your music had meant so much to me; it has been like having a friend on the other side of the ocean. And you have always been a huge inspiration to me as a fellow artist (I'm a fine-artist and performance-artist): your way of never making it easy on yourself, always pushing your (personal & artistic) boundaries to the next level. Staying authentic and devoted to your own style and choice of media, in this rapidly changing world. To my, your music celebrates the beauty of imperfections. It's an incitement to be bold and alive, even if that means changing yourself, your life, letting go, try again, experiment, adjust and to be vulnerable. Thank you for charing your thoughts and emotions through your music and interviews. Thank you for being the artist you are.",0.9909,205
