Ed Lynn well I have to disagree Woody Woodpecker and Peter Rabbit are both original old cartoons that both got a live-action treatment that didn't do to good. Woody Woodpecker and Peter Rabbit the live-action movies are both bad. So none of them are ripoff they're all original content,-0.4226,51

"This comment section needs to lighten up. Woody Woodpecker is targeted at CHILDREN. Last time I checked most kid's movies are pretty lame as are most of the ones we grew up worshipping. The CGI looks like crap but considering this was originally a Brazilian release I'm not really surprised. As a fan of Woody I wish this could have had some money behind it, but that's not what happened. I'm convinced that the majority of this comment section either hate Woody Woodpecker, hate anything CGI, or just.can't remember what it's like to be a kid. My 7 year old loves Woody Woodpecker, and he'll probably like this. Lighten up.",0.8891,124

üò± whoa no freaking way this is like totally cool if this is the actual trailer for the movie and not a fan-made trailer. I know how sometimes some of the fans likes to make their own made trailers. Anyway if this is the actual movie that's coming out this is going to be the coolest.
