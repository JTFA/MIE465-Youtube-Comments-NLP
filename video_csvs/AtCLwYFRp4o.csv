"Covering Trumps bald spot as he got off Trump Force One during the campaign was actually the initial reason for the MAGA hats.- before he started to make so much money out of them.
But Trump has been known to indicate to his staff the state of his emotional state. White hats were for a good mood, whilst the red was supposed to indicate a foul mood.mstaff were then expected to behave ""appropriately"". This is according to an article with Trumps butler very early in the campaign. The same butler that had to disappear off the stage early on after tweeting that Obama should be shot by firing squad s a traitor. Before that, Trump having a butler (whom had been with him for decades-even coming out of retirement to continue to serve.) was supposed, like the Trump Force One, to be an impressive to his followers. Hell, you guys don't remember a bloody thing. That red cap/ white cap in a morning thing should have been a massive red flag to his followers. As was the supposed firing of the butler who had faithfully served for decades. Until it was unconvinient to his image that is. I don't know what really happened to him because I don't think he took him to the WH - where a Body Man would be taxpayer funded",0.4949,247
