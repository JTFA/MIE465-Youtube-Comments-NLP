"At one point during the 2nd hour of the p4a livestream,  I noticed something.  Someone had commented something that I disagreed with,  which caused me to have a mildly defensive,  borderline aggressive,  response to it.  But as the minutes passed by, the issue resolved itself because of kind people who were patient with the first-person a d in the end we had a new addition to the proud group of people who actively support nerdfightaria. Now I don't know if this made any sense..... But what nerdifighteria taught me, at 1am on the 16th of December,  a day before my birthday,  was a lesson to of patience,  tolerance and kindness. While I was so quick to judge and get defensive,  despite my absolute abhorrence to such acts,  I saw people being kind,  patient and most importantly,  just plain and simple, NICE!  And that is what gives me hope in this world, in human kind.

"The beginning of this video was a whole lot of ""me too"". Last week I really bottomed out mental health-wise so I've felt the same way about the end of 2017. It is always so beautiful to watch everyone come together for P4A and helps remind me there is good in the world. Thank you for sharing, John. 💖",0.9412,66

"They said that i was not normal 
I said define normal
They said normal is the thing that most people do 
I said so that means that what most of u do is normal and what a few of us do is not normal, god that is the most abnormal thing i ever heard 
Just because it is done doesn't means it should be done",-0.2057,66

This is one of the most uplifting videos I have seen for a while.  Although it contains a lot of simple truths that I know to true it is what I needed to hear at this time.  I am not entirely sure if John will ever read this but if so; thank you.,0.7631,57

"Your mental health description is something I can completely relate to. To everyone with mental illness reading this, I know at your low points that you can feel powerless and broken. As if nothing will get better.  However your illness  works in ebbs and flows. I know from experience that if you are immune to most medication treatments that you feel like you have demons in you that you can never escape. Please please remember that you are farthest thing from alone and that we are all interconnected in much more ways than we can ever fathom. This doesn't need to be taken as spiritually either. The human condition is one of immense pain and immense beauty. And far more often than not these characteristics intertwine in our day to day life than they are a dichotomy. Your brain can torture you and torture you until you feel hopeless and worlds away from everyone else.  But this is only your thoughts playing tricks on you. No matter how far away you feel, you are always connected to a much larger scale of interactions.",-0.9799,197
