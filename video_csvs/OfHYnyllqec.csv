"-Lord What do you mean by hosting the Olympics? Pyeongchang is hosting them. So it pretty much mean people do want to host the Olympics. If they didn't then why are there so many crowds in these stadiums? May I remind you the Olympics go back to ancient Greece and is a big part of history. Pathetic? So all these athletes that have dreamed their entire lives to train for them and now knowing that they achieved what they wanted and feel proud for all the hard work they've done and how they got here because they some of these atheltes were born with disabilities, were poor and had a hard life and now knowing that people told them that they couldn't do it, they proved them wrong because look at them winning medals and finally achieving their dreams even if they thought they couldn't do it is a reason to call the Olympics pathetic? Wow. That's a sad thing you just said.",-0.3983,175

"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?

Take a moment and consider the state of our world:


-The Middle East is at the tipping point.


-The world hates Israel.


-There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.


-There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).


-Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.


-Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.


-Perversion is running rampant.


-The weather is out of control.


-We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.


-Education is in the toilet.


-Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.

... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.

None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.

... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...

*Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.

Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say‚Ä¶?

What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?

Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.

As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!

Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...

Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.

Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...

Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought¬† you were so worth the effort that He created you!

Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?

If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:

Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""

Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""

Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""

Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""

C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""

Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""

Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""

Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""

Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.

**

Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.

Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""

Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",-0.9986,2013

It's the last separation remnant of the Cold War and it sickens me to see people with the same language and culture separated as two countries. The Cold War was a big impact on my family. My grandmother left Cuba during the Revolution to escape from Fidel and moved to the US by boat to live the American dream. Some of my family members stayed behind on the island because they were farmers living in Camaguey and they thought socialism would benefit them. But they were wrong. Once Fidel took power, he forced farmers to give up their land to the government and if they refused, they were killed right on the spot. And that's what happened. Sad. Family members that I never got to meet, since I was born way after they were killed, in the US in 2001. I've never visited Cuba but would really like to someday, hopefully soon. Anyway, because of my family's history with communism (I'm also Russian), I really want to see a democratic Korea rather than a Jucheist Korea under the Kim regime.",-0.1057,230

Russia took part in STATE SPONSORED DOPING. It was not the Americans that wanted them out of the Olympics, but the International Olympic Committee. What the hell are you doing, bringing up American/Russian marriages. Russia was banned from the Olympics in order to provide a fair competition to the rest of the world. You are the only one here trying to turn this into a America vs. Russia affair. Oh and also, since admit to copy and pasting, why didn't you just say that from the start? When several other people pointed it out, your response was"" uhhh i don't know, shut up you just don't like what I wrote"".",-0.9086,169

So friends, Jesus is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you.

Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him (John 6:37, paraphrased)

So come to Him today; repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He will wash away your sins, He will forgive you, He will make you new,
and He will deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth!
Jesus already took our punishment on the cross. Jesus died and rose again for all of us!

So I pray you make Jesus your Lord and Savior today, by calling upon Him! You will be saved! (Romans 10:13) 
All you need is mustard seed faith and sincere words from the heart!
