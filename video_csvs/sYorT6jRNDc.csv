"How do they know that things like this really happened? It seems that so many women are coming forward with accusations of being sexually assualted or harassed. What is there to prove these women aren't just accusing men for public attention? I know that these are real issues that many people struggle with, but why haven't they spoke about it before? (seems a little suspicious) It seems like everyone is is coming up with their own stories all at the same time. I do believe that more and more women are being inspired to speak up about their stories and I applaud them for that, but I also know that there are two sides to every story. If there is a women who fully engages in sexual contact with a man she cannot turn around and say they he sexually assaulted her. I'm not saying that we should tell the women to stop coming forward or that they are not telling the truth. I am just saying that we must treat both sides of the story equally with further investigation to prove that these accusations really did happen. With evidence to proved the claims, the men (or women) need to be held accountable for their actions.
