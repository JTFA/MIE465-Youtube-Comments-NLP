"I think you'd see similar pressure to resign from republicans if the alligations were substantiated.  With Franken, there's an incriminating foto.  With Roy Moore, the main accuser was proved to forge evidence against him.  I'm not for protecting criminals.  But in this country you are innocent until proven guilty.  That goes for Democrats and Republicans. Can you imagine how elections would look in 10 years if this becomes common practice. Every single candidate on both sides of the aisle would have dozens of complaints against them as soon as they announced they were running for office. People wouldn't be worried about their policies or beliefs, they would just be digging and digging and digging into the past for dirt.
 
And if all you need is an allegation to convince someone in the court of public opinion, you will see allegations, most probably being false, being thrown around against everyone. There are plenty of people in this country that feel that the ends justifies the means, and for them making a false allegation if it helps to Advance their political ideals is a small price to pay to get the person they want elected",0.0222,210

"I would suggest that EVERYTHING you have been taught in school and through your media, you look at the opposite view and see if it makes more sense. For example, in America our schools harp about ""slavery"" and the evil of the ""white man"", but after doing a little research I discover that blacks in the south owned nearly as many slaves as whites, that less than 7% of people in the South owned slaves, that slaves were bought from blacks in Africa and shipped by the Jews, that islamic pisshole nations had slavery for centuries before America was even formed and they had more white slaves than America ever had black slaves, etc., etc., etc. And this deception runs in ALL the subjects you have been taught by your revisionist Jew influenced schooling. For one more example, we hear endlessly about the ""6 million jews killed by Germans (a very questionable number)"", but how often do you hear about the OVER 10,000,000 Christians slaughtered by the Jews in Russia?????? just test EVER thing you have been fed, and see where the truth really is, white people have been demonized, when it is us who have fought to end evil in many many ways.

"In Alabama, the age of consent was and is 16 so none of those girls he had relationships with who now are revealing their relationships as if they were illegal for the masses who are unaware of the laws, were actually illegal. They consensually engaged in a relationship with an older man and now as they are older they realize how unhealthy their choices were and are uncomfortable with his part in it and want to call it abuse, while the law at the time and even now in the state it occurred did not and does not recognize a sexual relationship with a 16 year old as illegal. The girls were 16, 17 and 18. Playmates are also 18, 19 and nobody ever said anything during the decades we had them on Playboy covers or living in a house all together like prostitutes. In 32 states the age of consent is 16. It used to be as young as 7. We also don't all age at the same rate or live to be the same age. People in rural areas often don't live as long and there used to be a time when it was acceptable to marry at 12 or 13. We must go by what is the law and in Alabama, he did not break the law and it was very common for older guys to date girls that age. Girls that age had traditionally started dating and looking for a husband and a young attorney would have been a big catch. Especially during a time when mothers and fathers grew up in a society and supported laws that didn't recognize women's rights and that treated their daughters as if getting a husband and having his kids was their destiny. The media are narrating as if Moore broke a law. He was never banned from the mall, but yes there probably were women who didn't like that older men would hit on their daughters and anyone complaining to security in the mall would easily be able to have someone asked to leave. That doesn't mean he was banned for life. He has never had anyone formally charge him either. That is the system we have for getting justice and holding accusers accountable. It isn't in the public square like a lynch mob or in the current state of society, online like a witch hunt. If people are truly predators, find a recent victim. This woman who claims that Moore tried to have sex with her in his home when he signed her yearbook at 16, isn't describing a crime. Whether we find it appropriate or whether we like the idea of it, is irrelevant. It only matters what is legal and what can be proven. If she felt taken advantage of and abused she should have gone to authorities. She should have not given him her number, engaged in private conversations with him, met up with him on multiple occassions or gone to his home. What she says happened is that he undressed her and he undressed himself and that he then left the room and came back and he had an erection and he tried to get her to touch it. She expressed being uncomfortable and wanting to leave to which he stopped and took her home. Considering the age is not a factor because she was of legal age to consent and that he respected her wishes to leave and up to that point had been consensual in engaging with him, no crime was committed. She did not stop him from undressing her. She did not get dressed when he left the room. She did not leave the room. I don't like this law that says a 16 year old can consent, but Alabama is also it's own state and it is up to those residents there to change the laws. But we cannot allow society to try to persecute people online and use our emotions to try to manipulate our perspectives. I am a rape survivor. I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, psychological abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence. There are legitimate concerns with adults engaging with those who are emotionally and mentally less capable of making thoughtful decisions regarding their well being, but false accusations and equating sexual harassment and women not coming forward to protect their careers or social status, etc. to the suffering others go through with legitimate cases of abuse is only harming our chances of getting justice. JUST STOP.",0.6315,815

"Your Country Is Going To Ruin (Nation Wreckers; Jews‚Äô Modus Operandi) 
Basic internet research shows that Jews control the US monetary system 
via the Federal Reserve (Rothschild, Lazard Brothers, Israel Moses Seif,
 Warburg, Lehman Brothers, Kuhn Loeb, 
Goldman Sachs, National Bank of Commerce NY, Hanover Trust of NY). Jews 
also control the six largest media conglomerates in the world (Disney, 
Time Warner, Comcast, Viacom, 21rst Century Fox, CBS Corp.). Jews own 
the three largest advertising agencies on earth (WPP, Omnicom, 
Interpublic). Jews have the most powerful lobbies in Washington (AIPAC, 
ADL, SPLC, ACLU, AJC). Jews also control much of the internet (Google, 
YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo, My Space, Wikipedia, Amazon, eBay, Pay Pal) 
and readily share your personal information with government agencies. 
Most Ivy League schools have Jewish presidents or provosts (Yale, 
Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, Brown). Jews control most US professional 
sports (NBA commissioner Adam Silver, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, MLB
 commissioner Rob Manfred). Jews also own half of all NBA teams and 
one-third of NFL teams. Jews work in unison on the local, state, 
national, and international level. Jews are genetically psychologically 
aggressive, hyper ethnocentric, have a superiority complex, and have an 
historical grievance against Whites. Jews censor free speech, ban public
 religion, ban guns, force massive third-world immigration and 
integration, promote open borders and racial discord, promote reverse 
discrimination through Affirmative Action, promote gay rights, feminism,
 and depravity in the media and fine arts to divide and morally corrupt 
the populace. Jews have instituted political correctness to aggressively
 publicly punish dissenters and instill fear. In essence, Jews are a 
hostile elite.  On a global scale, Jews control the European Union, 
United Nations, banking (IMF and World Bank), media, and politics. Jews 
foment perpetual strife to uproot and realign nation states (Yugoslavia,
 Iraq, Afghanistan, Georgia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Ukraine) with Russia, 
China, and Iran currently being targeted. Jews‚Äô goal is to dilute all 
White nations with massive third-world immigration while creating a 
global borderless plural society with a single police-state government 
and single currency. At present, the White majority populations of 
Europe, US, Canada, and Australia are being systematically displaced by 
massive non-White immigration. And to those that say only a small 
fraction of Jews are to blame, the facts prove otherwise. Of the more 
than 300 Jewish political organizations, to the local synagogue, to the 
voting habits of Jews, most work in unison towards the demise of Whites,
 Christianity, and nation states and in favor of globalization. Most of 
the above information can easily be verified on the internet. 
Misinformed readers will quickly claim the moral high ground and dismiss
 these facts as racist or anti-Semite which is the conditioned response 
taught by the Jewish-owned media to thwart public discourse. Its not only an elite but the tribe supports their action. Very few have exposed their crimes and many gullible naive people have been brainwashed into supporting israel. IT is INHERENT in the jewish culture to decieve and manipulate the ""goyim"" (a word similar to infedils). Why is it that the entire muslim world is blamed for terror but its only a few with the jews despite the talmud clearly ordering them like in the quran to dispose and lie to the goyim (cattle). The alt lite is in fact controlled oppostion to stir the blame on muslims to benefit the zionist agenda and never question the Jews. If the West wants to survive, it needs to know the REAL enemy and organize against it. There was a reason the Jews were kicked out of 100 + countries. The facts dont lie, humans do. IM sick of all the jewish supporters on here who hide behind the race card and promote deception and more lied. Im no White supremacist but Hitler had a good reason to banish the jews to Israel (The greatest story never told). If you think its not a jewish conspiracy to genocide the white race slowly and take over the world then you are either a jew/crypto jew or brainwashed/ mentally ill.
