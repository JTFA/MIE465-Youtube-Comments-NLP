""It's only a rumor, but I heard from a source that Disney has announced a remake of ""Outrageous Fortune"" and Tina Fey and Kristen Wiig are in talks!!"" (the 1987 original starred Bette Midler and Shelly Long, BTW)

Lionsgate will decide on  Speaker for the Dead because they still want the YA market

He would not say that if he disagreed with his arc.  No, it doesn't take away that he initially did not agree but it also confirmed he is good with the final product.  And Hamill having bad ideas in the past goes directly to support any initial thoughts he had where to take the character in this film.  Just because you agree with him this time and not those times, doesn't mean it's not a worse idea.  He wanted Luke to be scarred up and have taken on dark side qualities before Return of the Jedi.  Whether you agree with him now and  not then doesn't matter.  It wasn't the way the filmmakers then and now wanted to take the character.  And Hamill proclaims this is a GREAT film.  People who ultimately do not like their character arc, do not say such things.  You can't take Mark's word out of context to give validations to your dislike of his character in the film.  If you don't like it, just don't like it on your own.  You don't need anyone, not even Hamill to back your thoughts.

"I heard that rumour about Solo too and although I take it with a big pinch of salt I have to wonder about the information it gives us.  Alden Ehrenreich can't act?  Well, Johns defence of the guy aside, he hasn't exactly set Hollywood on fire until Hail Caesar! came out and even then he wasn't the lead and didn't have a ton of screen time.  So I'm holding judgement on that, but I have to agree with John that if someone finds Kazdan's script unfilmable then there is something wrong here.  That guy created Han Solo, if anyone knows how to write for him Kazdan can.  But maybe what the rumour meant was that after Lord &  Miller screwed up so badly and had filmed almost all of the film that the script became hard to film for Howard when he had to incorporate what had been done with his reshoots?  Just a suggestion, lol.  

My main concern is that if Howard has reshot as much as it's being rumoured he has, over half the film, what does that do to the production budget?  After what we just saw with JL and Joss Whedon reshooting so much and pushing the budget to $300 million and now that movie being classed as a financial disappointment I wonder how much Solo's budget has now shot up to?

Marry poppins Leia through space I could go on & on. Disney has no idea or just doesnt care. You can watch both TFA & TLJ & clearly see they are trying to just erase the old, hell they say it in the film.

Hans dead Lukes dead & Carrie Fisher past away. Even Snoke is dead! The cast they have now sucks except for Driver. The Skywalker story should have been kept alive with its own films & other stories being told & if it worked let them intersect. I would have like to see Luke have twin sons & have to fight & survive in a galaxy in turmoil from the new Galactic Empire as Jedi ... ughh its too late I think",-0.9888,259
"In that same ""Jake Skywalker"" interview Hamill also said that he came to believe that Rian Johnson was the exact man that was needed for the job. Funny how no one wants to mention that and only focus on how Hamill had creative differences with Luke's arc. Which he also had with ROTJ. Actors have creative differences with writers and directors all the time, just the majority of them aren't as candid and open as Hamill so you never hear about it. And who can blame them when anything Hamill says about this now will either be twisted to show that he hated how his character was handled, or rejected because clearly it's not possible for an actor to say something positive about their movie unless they're being told to by those above them.",0.4404,143

Maybe you can because you're a critic and a director, but for me all is see is a story. And George did an amazing job of creating and telling this story and it's a huge shame he sold it. I like force awakens but last Jedi was a disappointment because rian took everything that was supposed to be important and there it away. TLJ was a clear message.

You also have to imagine that Disney will use his comments as a scapegoat for week-2 box office declines, so Mark Hamill has to make a tweet about the movie being an all-time great for his own sake. The underlying problem is that you cannot have 3 different directors doing a trilogy. That was the mistake right there, and to say that J.J. Abrahms was 100% in support of everything that Rian Johnson did ignores the plain fact that Johnson took Abrahm's story in a very different direction than the previous episode. If Abrahm's didn't like something Rian Johnson did, you know he can't possibly vocalize that.

The last Jedi just felt thrown together and there were so many moments that just took me completely out of the movie, I mean common Leia floating through space, and the over use of comedy was cringe worthy.

"Ok, after extensive search I found that portion of an interview.  Too many clips I'd seen had cut off before that or after that depending on what argument for or against the movie was being made.  So he does say he hasn't completely accept it.  So I was wrong about that.  And I really wasn't looking because I don't really care if Mark likes the movie or not.  I can form my own feelings and opinions about it, and do not need to find validation from other sources.  But he continues in that same interview by saying ""Hey, it's just a movie....I came to believe Rian was the exact man that they needed for this job.""  I can understand Mark living with Luke as he was in the OT for so many years as his last experience with the character, and struggling with this character change.  He is no different than Luke not being able to accept the way things have gone.  In the movie, that is why Luke goes into exile.  In another interview he says ""It‚Äôs better to surprise people and it‚Äôs getting harder and harder...., so again, I think I‚Äôm wrong‚Ä¶.I trust Rian so deeply.""  I think Hamill is still more upset that he wasn't in TFA more than anything in this film.  So, yes, the direction that was taken was different than Hamill initially thought, but in all interviews he talked about coming around to the idea, which is why he tells about both sides of those stories.  But so many people have edited out the pieces they want to support on both sides, that what all he said has just fueled the fire on those sides.  So I think his last tweet about it was the most sincere he could be and was there to put the record straight.  He probably still struggles with Luke not being the OT Luke, but he accepts the story that was given and is supportive of why it had to happen from this movie and Star Wars in general, and that he was on-board with Rian's vision.  Hamill does not own the character just the performance.  And his performance was the best it had ever been as Luke in The Last Jedi.  His performance seems, to me, to show that he really believed this approach is what him as an actor and Star Wars as a franchise both needed.  And he hoped everyone landed on the side of loving it and not be upset with it, probably because of the hard work he did put into it.  But, ultimately, what he said should not be an argument whether the movie is good or bad.  There is, in fact, no universal right answer for that, and that's okay.",0.4474,518
"One of Hamills original statements, paraphrasing, was that if you think you're going to get old Luke you're going to be disappointed, this is a completely different Luke. That statement still stands true. We can also speculate that he's changed his mind due to the fact that he's employed by the mouse. Kind of odd that he's hated TLJ the whole time until after the movie came out. It's possible he did just change his mind. But, I still hold his original statements and opinions as correct. The characters, the plot lines, the political emphasis, the lack of cohesion and consistency between TFA and TLJ let alone TLJ and the original films, the bending of previously set rules and logic in order to fulfill plot goals, leaving out highly obvious outcomes to further plot goals. I have a feeling a lot of critics were paid off very well this Christmas.",-0.1548,167

It's intended to be a movie that 60 year olds can enjoy just as much as 8 year olds. Black, white, Asian, male, female...Star Wars(going way back to 1977 was way ahead of the curve).

By all standards, the opening weekend of The last Jedi showed that there was still this ""Force Awakens"" crowd still here. What differed IS that the Last Jedi was poorly executed as a classic Star Wars movie and pandered to the ""potential"" next generation of fans. They sent a massive F U to a whole demographic from 40-60 years old in order to reel in the younger(especially female) audience. Denying this just lacks critical thinking. And good on Disney for going for it, but as it stands, coming off one of the biggest films of all time(The Force Awakens), the Last Jedi is pacing to do Rogue One type numbers.

T Bone Actually he said that if both movies are good then BvS will make more than CW but until we see the quality of the films we can never know. As for TLJ I personally think his love for SW blinds him on how bad the movie is on multiple levels.,0.4588,54

"TLJ haters are so hilarious. Anything to keep their narrative going....lol..... Mark comes out with a definitive statement and now he's ""strong armed/paid by Disney"". At what point can you guys just simply accept that you didn't like the movie, but many did?? That you don't need validation from an actor (who never gave it to you in the first place) to have your opinion, and while your opinion is in the minority, it's still your opinion. Be content with that. The world will spin on, Star Wars films will keep getting made, and you will or won't be a fan of them.

"That is never a quote made by Hamill.  The only place the phrase ""hasn't accepted"" has been adopted is from the title of the articles referencing that interview and is being taken out of context.  If Hamill ever mentioned those words then I haven't been able to find it. In that interview, he is talking about the process he had to use to think of Luke in this way.  Yes, he thought of Luke a certain way based on the OT, and this was different so he had to think differently.  Most actors really enjoy turning a character in a different direction because it challenges their acting abilities.  The last thing we have heard from him is the tweet which clearly shows he has more than accepted it.",0.8729,140

Let's run with the Quinn stuff for example. Darren X (meaning me or anyone) posts that comment. How likely is it? Well,WB/DC has a full mishmash of a slate. It is common sense that not everything on said slate will come to pass. It is common sense that all those Joker and Quinn projects aren't needed.

"Unless this script is Citizen Kane level out of this world, which anyone working on these new Star Wars movies seem completely unable to come up with, this Han Solo movie must include one of two things... Either an actor who looks extremely similar to Harrison Ford, or an actor who can pretty much act just like Harrison Ford, mannerisms included. If this actor doesn't have either characteristic, it will not go well for this movie. Star Wars is more like a religion than just a popular movie. Just as fans want to see accurate portrayals of Biblical movies, Star Wars movies need to have a certain consistency with the original three movies were all used to!

"What to say... Will just plant my general negativity here. I watch a lot of movies. And I enjoy the immersion into other worlds. To me movies are works of art. And Beauty is in the eye of the beholder I know. It saddens me to read some of these questions. I've read about the entire industry struggling for decades, seems like they're stuck in quicksand, constantly battling the forces of advanced technology and the popularity of the blah review. I feel I'm in the minority, that the truth is people don't like going to the movies like I do. They find it cumbersome, pricey, uncomfortable, and they seem to be disinterested. So what if Blade Runner didn't do well at theaters. The original didn't either. Some people find blade runner dull, and they'll probably feel the same about 2049: that its a dried husk of an experience(which, it's supposed to be). I guess my real gripe to those out there reading this is, it bugs me to hear about every grand tale that pops into screens ""IS A FAILURE AND THEREFORE TOTAL CRAP BECAUSE NOT AS MANY PEOPLE WENT AND PAID TO SEE IT AS THE STUDIO HEADS THOUGHT, AND AN ACTOR HAD DIFFERENT IDEA""ugh I think maybe what's really bugging me is that, I wish more would earnestly stand by what they like rather than just constantly piss on everyone else. If you say you like Star Wars, but you haven't enjoyed a Star Wars film in over 30 years, then you don't really like Star Wars. I feel the same about people who say they only like the first one or two Alien films, or ""pretend matrix sequels don't exist"" . If all you have to offer to a movie discussion is ""but it only made so much money"" then go become a friggin accountant.",-0.8639,349
"When Mark Hamill comes out and says something great it‚Äôs true. When Ben Affleck or DC does the same it‚Äôs a PR spin.

Of course after all of that he‚Äôs going to hear it from Disney and be told to say something positive. But Campea believes what he wants and ignores all the most recent times Hamill said he wasn‚Äôt happy with Luke (not the overall movie).",0.5274,122
