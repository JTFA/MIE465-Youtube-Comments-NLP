I say goodbye to love again
In loneliness, my only friend
In loneliness, my only fear
The nights end
Then I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening the door
Until your memory is gone

In loneliness, my only friend
In loneliness, my only fear
The nights end
Then I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening the door
Until your memory is gone
The night, slow, long
