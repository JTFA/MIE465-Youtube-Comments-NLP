"To make a waterproof PCB with silicone I suggest you put the circuit in a plastic bag and then pour the silicone, which you can then shape around the components simply by squeezing the polyethylene bag where you need it.
You will get smoother surfaces and thinner layers. and (perhaps) minor drying times.
Afterthe silicone hardening you can remove the bag without difficulty since the silicone does not adhere to the polyethylene.
The high temperature silicone does not have a better thermal conduction than normal silicone but only a higher resistance to high temperatures (around 250-280 ¬∞) while the normal silicone resists up to 200 ¬∞.
Temperatures to which our PCBs are already permanently dead, so it is possible to use the normal silicon with a small saving (in case hig temperature is more expensive)

"Wow, there are a lot of comments to read.  Great, as always, (ok... some are excellent and not bad) video, demonstration, instruction and detail.  

I have to comment though since Hitler like France's Napoleon invade Prussia and this is my duty since there may be family over there still that didn't flee.  

I am about to coat a pair of sandals, areas on a nice (way to expensive) pair of gloves and boots (that are rather expensive also) areas where the polymer has cracked before more separation occurs.  I do sometimes think I can take more off or soak in the solvent first to get better penetration... though I don't do much other than think if I do nothing. 

So, upon researching (an instructable post regarding waterproofing with silicone) I found which solvent to use to thin out the silicon as I usually like to research before I experiment since like most... time is limited as life is pretty much time and resources and I wish you more resources since you are excellent apparently with your time.

OK, tangent... back to where I was and the point before I go off on rhetorical writings... maybe thinning the silicone with a solvent and painting on like the nail polish is shown will help improve performance in more than one way.  I was also thinking, as I have with some components... seal with a heat exchange pipe or heat exchange portion(s) exposed to so attach or have optimal materials surface area for the heat to transfer. 

Other than that... excellent showing off doing so with capacitors.  I so am thinking that is a great idea to prevent a mess on a circuit board.  I thought very humorous the sealing proprietary circuits also.  No kidding.  :-|)

Clear epoxy is awesome looking too for many items and I didn't think about for electronics projects.  Really interesting.  Maybe a UV reflecting clear polyurethane for outdoor equipment to prevent discoloring or discoloring so soon.
