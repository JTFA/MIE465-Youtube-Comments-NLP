"Absolutely not. If I want to give people something etched, I'm probably going to buy and use the device that was meant for etching things. Or, just give them something different that I can actually make with the materials I already have, such as a hand-lettered calligraphy card or a drawing/watercolor of something they love.",0.5739,63
"Aditi C I've never seen foil tape in real life, and didn't even know it existed, but it looks like it's a lot thicker than foil. I do believe that the foil would shred when you cut it, and also it would not be simple to lift up away from the cut. I think sticking to the board and the thickness of the tape is what matters",-0.2263,72
