"I recall three major tax cuts occurring in the twentieth century, one under Warren G. Harding during the recession of 1921-1922 which prompted the economic boom in the roaring twenties. Then in the 1960s under John F. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and then one in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan after the recession in the beginning of his presidency, this one resulted in an economic boom that led to the Internet age in the 90s and early 2000s. Tax cuts give more money back to the individual, history had proven that when people have more money in their pocket, they can spend more on goods and services and stimulate the economy. Also if one has more money regardless of social status, then they aren't as pressured to find tax loopholes or flat out not paying their taxes. In the 80s, an increase in federal spending from an influx of tax money led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. More money to the people means more money to the government. As for the rich and corporations, I never knew why the left likes to punish people who are successful in life, while I am not rich myself, I have rich  family members who are nice people, they are often stereotyped as greedy, there are instances of greedy individuals in the world, but to stereotype all wealthy individuals as being greedy and evil is not warranted. If a corporation had more money, then they have more money to give to the employees, they won't need to cut jobs or find manufacturing overseas in a country with lower corporate taxes. The healthcare thing I have no answer for, maybe with the increase in federal revenue caused by a tax cut there can be higher funds for some type of plan, but I don't believe they is a definitive answer to health care on either side of the political spectrum, at  least I haven't found it yet.",-0.3453,354

What they blatantly skipped the big multinationals don't pay the full tax now. Only the small/medium do. 2, corporate tax is passed on to the worker and customer. The CEO don't cut when tax rise they passed it off. And when demand goes up the companies that don't invest will be passed up for the ones that do. Trust me. Investors love growth over income for the same reason the global corp moves overseas it is more tax efficient. 
Leveling the playing field spurs growth. It did under Reagan and JFK. At the same time state (gov) revenue didn't go down. It was made up by the added growth. 
What does happen the bureaucrat gets greedy and wants to add tax onto of that growth to get more revenue except it slow growth instead causing them to borrow more instead to get that added revenue.
It becomes a vicious loop from there. Raise more slows down more then ultimately need to borrow more then to raise more to pay for the borrowing of more.
It does start out on raises taxes to pay for something and not getting that added revenue. Because the raise moved investment out. So instead the borrow. Could we lower spending. Not likely. Just special interest alone will constantly fight for more taxes to pay for their projects.",0.9804,276

"actually, people who don't itemize on their federal return could see see quite a bit more money end-of-year if the standard deduction is indeed doubled and the tax bracket figures aren't messed with.

doubling the standard deduction means more money for them.

either in less tax withheld or a larger refund.

you can run the numbers using a hypothetical non-itemized return and compare federal tax liability in 2105 and for next tax year.

i'd start with a hypothetical $50,000 gross income. 

i'm (guessing) that's above the median income across america these days when you don't consider high-income states (hawaii, ny, new jersey, california, massachusetts, connecticut, alaska). Those are also states where people tend to file complex, itemized returns.

Doesn't matter how high the tax rate is for huge businesses if they don't pay that actual tax rate. Have you just been ignoring why people were upset over trump not paying into taxes using loopholes? Big businesses have been using loopholes to get out of the taxes and small businesses and pay politicians to keep it that way, the middle class are the ones who have always been paying into taxes at the full rate.  this isn't accidental and businesses before have always managed with those tax rates so there is no excuses. Its not fair to reward big businesses who have been not giving there fair share and then complain about it to the point that programs for the poor and middle class who have always paid into taxes at the full rate are now going to be cut. The middle class and businesses have always been paying out the rich ceos problems for purposely scamming Americans. Again the rich have never been more rich and well off and have never been so far away from the middle class in earnings and progress then ever before and that's why if you want tax cuts then you should be more focused on the poor and middle class that is continuing to crumble then the rich who are well off.",0.8228,266
