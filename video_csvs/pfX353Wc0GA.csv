I bet you don't say this to any white person you see saying something racist. Typical white hypocrite. ""Racism"" is only a problem for white assholes like you when it's black people.
If black people made them they're black dance moves, so calm down you dummy. When you create something you want credit but when black people try to take credit for what we do you want to claim racism. Which really we all know you're the only people who do that. Which is why you're always looking for someone to call ""racist"" cause you don't wan to be the only ones 
If irish people make dance moves you'd identify them as such. What I said is a fact. Only a closet racist would deny these are black dance moves while pretending they're not racist",-0.9469,150
