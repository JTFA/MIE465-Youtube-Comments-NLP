I really preferred the Choir singing with out the lead vocals. It was just great to hear the hundreds of voices singing the melody together rather then being used as background vocals.,0.6249,34
"I think you'd be fine, regardless. Music is an emotional expression. I've been a professional singer since my teens (several decades) and I still get goosebumps or teary-eyed as powerful emotions arise when singing certain songs. It's genuine and adds to a performance.  So, join a choir, or go to karaoke, and sing your heart out!",0.8436,67

"Shame you had to wait over 30 years. In an amazing series of coincidences, I happened to be visiting NYC the freezing February it was released. It was probably the most moving, soulful and amazing cinematic musical event I've seen, especially being a Talking Heads and Eno fan. 
This heroes performance channels the original Bowie performance I love and is better than many of Bowie's live versions.",0.959,74
Shame! Shame! Shame! Could not help but think of Game of Thrones during that part.,-0.7687,19

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
