"i know both as i do train both.. and dont talk about not allowing a non boxer to beat mayweather.. if mcgreggor had the skills and he ko-ed floyd no one can do anything about it.. you're basically implying conor was paid off to lose.. dont you get it, conor has good boxing abilities for mma but when it comes to boxing he knows shit.. conor gassed in the 3rd round.. if you trained youself in any kind of sport you'll know there's a limit you have before you start to feel your arms and legs feel heavy.. floyd shelled up and took the punches on the glove.. hitting someone hard on the gloves is just like hitting a heavy bag in a way.. once conor got gassed, his power dropped.. his arms felt heavy.. his legs was wobbly.. floyd washitting him in the body, lowering his stamina even more.. thsts why conor was so weak around the late rounds that he didnt have the energy to even put up his hands to block in the high guard.. he got knocked all over the ring and lost.. in fact if you say its rigged, then why would the ref not even penalize conor for doing so many illegal moves.. conor was basically doing so many hammer fists .. just face defeat ..",-0.968,242
"i know both sports well so you're the dumb one.. first of all, mcgreggor did try to take out mayweather in the first round.. he failed..  nate diaz is no where on the level of boxing that floyd has so you cant use nate diaz to quote your ' justification ' for why mcgreggor lost.. first of all, in boxing its 12 rounds.. so mcgreggot was also trying to pace himself.. nate has been dropped multiple times in his career.. floyd hasnt been dropped once.. he has a granite chin so stop with your ignorance.. mcgreggot just had no power.. just admit it.. your God lost.. be a man about it and stop whining..",-0.827,129

"you know what you can believe whatever you want to believe if it helps you sleep better at night. its a fight anything can happen.. everyone has a punchers chance.. its 12 rounds.. one wrong move from mayweather and he might have been down.. mayweather has a granite chin. on top of that he has top notch defense.. i can guarantee you any of the welterweights that floyd has faced punches much harder than conor.. if pacquiao went to mma, he would be ko-ing guys left and right if the punches connect.. it just takes one. shane mosely as well.. floyd got rocked and nearly dropped by shane mosely.. yet he didnt.. unless you're thinking that conor hits harder than shane or pacquiao, i'd advice you to come back to reality..",0.5719,147
