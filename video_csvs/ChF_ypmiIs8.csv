"Actually, I meant exactly what I said. This song is about loving women. You're delusional. You obviously don't know a thing about Keith; otherwise, you wouldn't be spewing such vile shit. (I've been listening to country music for over ten years now, and most of it talks about women in a way that's very cold and impersonal, like silly and stupid however sexy things. It's not alright. This shit about Adam and Eve is maybe the source of it.)",-0.8444,93

I have been looking for this song forever i'm so glad I found it,0.5949,14
"I hear this song quite often because I like to listen to Country music on the radio, and I hate this song, this crap, so much. My biggest qualm is at 1:15 where Keith mentions the ""she asked for it"" argument, and implying anybody who says anything similar to that is a horrible person. 
Wearing a skirt will get you different reactions from people than if you were wearing sweatpants, that's demonstrably true. If a girl wears a skirt she is well aware of the attention she'll get from it, from my point of view that is why people wear skirts, to flaunt what they got. (But I'm a male, so maybe I don't get to have an opinion on this.) 

My other gripe with this song is the obvious preaching to the converted. He's well aware that women are easy to pander to, and he's also probably aware that he'll get no flak for pandering. I mean, who would ever want to criticize such an empowering song? Where Keith sings the praises of women everywhere, after all women have been oppressed since the beginning of time, so it's time to give them special privileges.

I believe that's the end of my rant, feel free to tear me a new one with witty comments full of emojis. Also, I don't care what names I get called, so throw 'em at me. I'm also willing to actually have a discussion about this to people who actually want to talk, but judging by the other comments, everyone's drunk on girl power, and will just throw their word vomit at me.",-0.5077,303

"Such a precious and beautiful song. I’m glad someone finally wrote one that calls out those who hold distorted and unkind views of women. This song is not meant to pander, it is is to empower. Those who disagree with the message and are commenting angrily are not actually experiencing feelings of anger at Keith or the song—their feelings are directed inward. They’re feeling convicted and guilty because of how they have treated women and their angry comments show their coping style.

Of course, current country music should be included in the equation as it implicates society today and is important. It's an integral part of country music. And I don't care about society fifty years ago (I wasn't talking about country music or society fifty years ago) because you're surely not a class act like those guys were back then and neither is the music of the country genre today.
