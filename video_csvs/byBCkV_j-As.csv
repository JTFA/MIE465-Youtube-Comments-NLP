That aerie role model commercial I just watched did not show her AMAZING BODY one time? What's up with that .saw all those other girls like in bras and stuff .why not her? Annoyed me is... she was in long sleeve shirt or pants?? What kind of body positive commercial is that? Even if it was a short cut version .still annoyed me,-0.2478,72

"The only thing this ""no touch up"" movement is doing is losing jobs for models with small imperfections like crows feet and moles etc. B4 when cover girl would hire a model they could pick a woman in her late 20's early 30s with a few wrinkles and they would air brush them out. Now inseam of hiring that model they'll just hire someone else younger with flawless skin and not have to airbrush anything out. You will never see imperfections in magazines ads.

Uhmm...I don't know why people are saying that there are no thick girls but I saw a thick girl there. I think her name is Iskra and she's a body positivity activist. And I don't know why people are shaming these girls cos they skinny. Aren't they supposed to be proud of thier bodies?,0.8402,60
"Umm wtf is wrong with you people in the comments? You want them to show obese women too? These girls looked very healthy to me, not too skinny but not fat and unhealthy either. Keep in mind they are also models so they are supposed to be above average in terms of appearance. Sorry to break it to you but being overweight or obese is unhealthy and not something to celebrate. Maybe instead of complaining, you guys can look up to these girls as inspiration and proof that it is possible to be healthy? These kind of bodies are attainable through diet and exercise. Plain and simple. And yes, even people with a medical condition still have no excuse. My mom has a thyroid condition where it is extremely hard for her to lose weight but you know what? She still manages to keep her weight in check. Her BMI is in the normal category and she isn‚Äôt overweight despite having a thyroid problem. So bottom line- there is no excuse to be overweight. It is all up to YOU. Stop complaining because Aerie doesn‚Äôt encourage unhealthy and dangerous behavior.",-0.684,213

"Well ain't that hilarious. I like the hypocrisy of praising acceptance for thickness but you don't actually put thick and fat women on your ad. And don't even get me started on the ""representation"" virtue signaling. Where are the dark skin women with 4c hair? Where are the Indian women in your ads? How about some women from Vietnam? Where are the Latinas at? Where are the girls with no make up or contour? Where are the super tall and super short girls with stretch marks and skin marks? Where are the big tummies at?Uh? If you're really about that real stuff then be real. Don't just jump on the bandwagon of progress and pretend to be for women's empowerment and then do this act.

You do this to make girls think you got their back but I bet $5 y'all still reject people at your casting calls if they don't meet the beauty standard you so fakefully pretend to dismantle.
