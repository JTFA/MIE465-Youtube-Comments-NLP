DatLove    Right on. That was the ethos on this venue - at the start. Everyone shared their how-tos (no charge). Half the fun is learning how it works from others - then applying your own twist (getting creative). Nowadays the fan boys get upset if you don't march to the beat of their drummer...and pay the piper.,0.6124,68

"Hey Louis 

I just bought your presets today and they look amazing – thank you for putting the presets together! However, regarding to ""FFL Peruvian Palette"" vs. ""FFL Stark Tundra"": I just found out that the two presets are EXACTLY the same with (Tone Curve, Sharpen and all of the settings are the same) - they are basically just the renamed version of the exact preset. I'm not sure whether this was done on purpose or was a mistake when putting the preset together. Please advice.

"I use a MS program called Picture It! Photo 7.0 (2002) which is surprisingly good at enhancing photos. It came free with my first Windows XP computer. Although Microsoft dropped it several years back it works fine on Windows 10. I have tried many other free programs like Google Picasa, but none of them match it. I have used it several times to rescue bad photos which are under lit, back lit etc. mainly from cell phones, and to add life to dull photos. Obviously it's nowhere near as good as your expensive program, but it's great for amateur use, and yes, sometimes it fails. You can't get it anywhere now unless you know someone who still has a Microsoft Works 2002 disc. Anyone wanting a free photo editing program should try Paint.net, but download it free from the original site, not a third party one. It works just like Photoshop but does not have some of the more sophisticated bells and whistles. There are loads of Paint.net instruction videos on YouTube.",0.9877,194
