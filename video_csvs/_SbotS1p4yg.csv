"Another great resort tour!! I love GF but out of all the Disney resorts this is the best! The location is perfect and I know I am in the minority but I really love that Yacht Club is dog friendly! We live in a world where a lot of couples are childless sometimes by choice and sometimes not and so their pets are like their children! It isn't cheap to stay here and so one would think that a person bringing their dog here usually has the means to have a well behaved, clean and social dog! Cape May Café has a great character breakfast but the seafood buffet isn't a character dinner. Could you also do a thorough tour on Swan and Dolphin...I love that resort, too!!",0.9946,141

Still bothers me how much Disney sells food for, when their resorts are so expensive.  Families on budgets have a hard time paying for the expensive food.  Been There.  Done That.  And bought a T shirt but not a button down shirt - - That was one HIGH priced shirt at the yacht club!!!  Ate at Cape Mays, not very memorable, but it was extremely crowded when we were there.  And I have to add we live in Florida, so we are used to super fresh sea food all the time.  I would like to see dinner at the Yacht club Steak house.  I bet that is fancy.  Awesome video Tim.

"I worked at the Yacht when I was in the WDW College Program.  I worked in a shop called Fittings and Fairings, Clothing and Notions.  It was 1/2 Disney mdse and 1/2 upscale resort clothing.  There was a large wooden model ship in the store entrance that was driven by Mickey.  Michael Jackson (I met him and many other celebrities and sports stars... they stayed in the Admiral's Suite) offered to buy it.

The cast member cafeteria was excellent.  It was very affordable and I really believe that the food was from the Yachtsman.

"Our first visit to Disney World we stayed at the Beach Club. The sliding door of our room opened to the pool at the roundabout at the rear entrance.  My boys could walk out of the pool and right into the room without having to go through the lobby.  We saw kids running through the lobby with their pool stuff on an nobody batted an eye...it was so chill there.  This was absolutely the best place to stay in my opinion. We ate at the yacht club, took a walk around and felt the atmosphere was a bit sour.  We could walk to epcot, the boardwalk, or hollywood studios...this place was awesome!  The pool, best on property hands down. Nothing like a night stroll to epcot from here to catch illuminations.  The year we stayed at Wilderness Lodge...I missed that convenience so so bad!  Our next trip will definitely be beach club again.

I almost forgot...there was a ton of current (for our slower folks...fast moving water) around that lazy river, and it is deep...be careful if you are a non swimmer.",0.9022,213

Stayed here once and never knew about the pool table! The sand bottom pool felt SOOOOOO good on my feet after long days in the parks.

"Thanks for this extensive tour. It’s the best overview that I have seen. We are staying there this spring for the first time and I hope it’s much warmer then!
It’s really interesting to see how the resorts are in the winter - I have never previously considered what it might be like in cool weather. It was also strange to see all the lifeguards even though nobody was using the pools. Another thing I had never considered was that anyone can visit the resorts even if they have no Disney reservations. Doesn’t that make overall security a problem? I wonder whether people are ever challenged about being on site? Perhaps not because all potential business is likely to be encouraged. Great video.",0.9703,141
