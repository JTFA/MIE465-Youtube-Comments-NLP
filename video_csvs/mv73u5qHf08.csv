No - it's a great story, but not a true one. It is generally accepted that the longbow claim is a myth which became popular in the 1990s, and that there is *no* evidence of its use as an insult until many centuries after the Hundred Years War. (In any case the only record of archers having fingers removed had them losing all three that were required to pull a longbow.) Sorry.",-0.8846,85
