"Been waiting for a new song to be obsessed over. It’s been a while. The second this came on I knew I was going to love it! 

Love me some Luke Bryan. Have to laugh when dumb ass rednecks say Luke Bryan isn’t country. I’m like have you ever milked a cow, bailed some hay and lived on a farm? Just because you carry your NRA card and shout lock her up doesn’t make you country. Nowadays, that makes you more of a Russian then an American!",0.8217,105

It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Es sólo una noche normal de un sábado de verano
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
Los mismos chicos y chicas y las mismas estrellas arriba en el cielo
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Es como si la música hubiese dejado de sonar cuando vi tu cuerpo
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?
¿Viniste aquí con alguien o viniste a la fiesta esta noche?
My little light out of nowhere girl
Mi lucecilla llovida del cielo, nena
Where you been all my life?
¿Dónde has estado toda mi vida?
Where you been trying to hide?
¿Dónde has tratado de esconderte?
It's like you come
Es como si llegases
Come from another world
Llegases de otro mundo
Fell right out of the sky
Caíste directamente del cielo
And landed right here tonight
Y aterrizaste justo aquí esta noche
Do you wanna dance with me?
¿Quieres bailar conmigo?
Any way you gotta be
De cualquier manera tiene que ser
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
¿Quieres ir a algún lugar mi chiquilla llovida del cielo?
My out of nowhere girl
Mi chica llovida del cielo
Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend
Nena, ¿estás perdida? ¿Estás aquí en la ciudad sólo durante el fin de semana?
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
Toda mi vida he estado aquí, nunca te vi antes
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
Si necesitas a alquien que te enseñe el lugar, nena yo lo haré
I gotta know you and hold you
Tengo que conocerte y abrazarte
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore
Ya no quiero irme de aquí solo

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
