you are right ... i did my research  ... but there is on thing they don't get ... most of Muslim countries will not accept this because technically there is no country called Israel they went to the holy land ... killed children and destroy houses and settle in there lands ... now imagin for a second some guys came from nowhere and start killing your country people and start there own country in your homeland how you gonna feel about it ?
but thinking of it its the same way America was created ... am just stating facts ... 
and by the way, don't get me wrong ... I think Mr.trump is a great businessman ... and he should stick to business because believe he acts first and uses his brain after its too late ... come on man ... it's like giving a 10 years old the nuclear codes of the entire world would you do that?
