But even with so many situations the vast majority of the times they were connected enough to rebel from the known together, showing their compatibility. Shame they died though (it is black mirror after all).

Yeah we were looking at one simulation (they reference their previous date during the encounter with her new boyfriend, there's continuity)

That's my take anyways. Great episode the creators are amazing",0.8552,159

Hang the DJ is about a dating program that helps you find love but San Junipero is more about life after death. It's like saying the Notebook and Titanic are the same only because they have a love interest in the plot.,0.9501,71
ben Miller Saying it's just another San Junipero is not doing it justice. A lot of BM episodes deal with love.,0.3451,23

best of this season

"carlos rocha They died. Literally they were deleted. The other version of them in the real world will likely fall in love, but it won't be the same Amy & Frank we saw.",0.0772,37
carlos rocha so basically everything we watched was actually a computer simulation made up by a dating app. In order to find out who is best for each other in real life it records which couples rebel against the system most together and matches them together. Any and frank rebelled against the system 998/1000 times. So therefore in real life. (Which we see briefly at the end) the dating app knows they'll be a good couple.,0.6705,83

"i love that they showed us the two simulations where they didnt rebel: the first time they met and that other time where he checked the expiry date, but even for the latter he suggested rebelling to her. true chemistry!",0.6327,44
i love this episode so much brb having existential crisis,0.0258,10

one thing i didn't get: were the two unrebellious encounters out of 1000 the ones where they first met and when frank fucked up with the timer?  were we looking at just one simulation? or multiple?,-0.7131,40

also reminds me of tv show Married At First sight and of some parts of netflix show The Good Place.

"the world that they are living in is just a simulation done by the dating app. which means the app simulated 1000 virtual versions of Amy and Frank in a virtual world so that they can be used as a statistic to know how compatible the ""real"" Amy and Frank, and out of their 1000 simulations, 998 have rebeled against the system (the system tried to tear them apart). Which shows that in the real world, Amy and Frank are 99.8% compatible, based on the virtual world simulated by the dating app",0.0,103

"we don't really have a lot of information of the other simulations, but it is possible that the circumstances were different in each of the 1000 simulations. Like they were matched up with different people, or any other alterations in the social of phisical environment. Or it could be that the surrounding is the same, but the characters made different choices, assuming free will (like the dude didn't check the remaining time, or checked earlier or later, or didn't aggree to the deal on the first place). But whichever is the case, science (since the system is based on science) relies on multiple trials and on statistics of those trials, and since not all 1000 of the pair chose escape, and they stand there in different clothes, it is more than likely that there were indeed differences between the different simulations. I too would be interested in some of the other versions, and it would be nice to know what caused that two pairs not to rebel",0.9563,186
what a beautiful episode.,0.5994,5
what the fuck this episode was so fucking good i cant barely speak holy shit it blew my fucking mind,-0.5211,20
ya ''lighthearted'' wasn't the right word. but less scary like Playtest cuz there was a spider-man and other scary things. and someone died. also i didn't think San Junipero was simple and sweet,-0.7775,40
"yep, favorite out of first 4 so far. and it was first i watched too. its also best rated episode on imdb",0.8555,25
