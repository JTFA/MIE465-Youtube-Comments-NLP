"I can tell by listening to this that you did NOT consult a software engineer who has experience writing progress indicators. Since you're just making assumptions here.

The only thing that can muck up the ""accuracy"" of a progress indicator is externalities: events occurring outside the program. Otherwise, unless the progress indicator is not properly implemented, it will project an estimated time to completion from several factors: how long the task has been in progress, how much of it has been completed in a particular period of time (called a ""burst rate""), and how much of it has been completed since the job started (called the ""average rate"").

Then there's another variable that I've only seen used a few times, so it's not commonplace: a median rate. Basically this is the median value of the determined ""burst rates"".

Now of these three rates, which is the most accurate? If you said the ""average rate"", you'd actually be wrong. It's actually a combination of the burst rate and average rate, with the median rate being slightly more accurate if it's the only variable on which you're relying. The problem, though, is how much memory is needed to maintain the data necessary to calculate the median rate. Which is why it's almost never used. Instead a combination of the burst rate and average rate is typically used in determining the estimated time to completion. Some rely only on the average rate.

Until externalities come into play. There are numerous variables that can affect the overall transfer. And both the source and destination come into play. None of this can be adequately accounted for.

The only thing on which we can base an estimation is the average and burst rates.",0.9186,332

"I have a two hour long vid that took an estimated 12 hours to render, plus a few more hours to mux the audio & video together while the progress bar was at 99.99999% with ""5 seconds remaining"" [the vid is being uploaded right now as I'm typing all of this]. All of that rendering took place on one of the workstations at the Oklahoma City Community College Keith Leftwich Memorial Library's Student Computer Center on the third floor. If I rendered the project at home on my new desktop that I just built, it would have taken a few weeks or more, maybe even a month, compared to the 2010 13"" MacBook Pro A1278 7,1 that I used previously it would've taken about more than a month today running on MacOS 10.11, compared to a few days to a week when it ran on MacOS 10.6.8.

Right now, I have another vid being rendered. It's about 15 minutes long, but it only took about an hour and 20 minutes to render on one of the college library's workstations, plus the muxing that takes place for another hour or so when there's ""5 seconds remaining"" at 99.99999%.
