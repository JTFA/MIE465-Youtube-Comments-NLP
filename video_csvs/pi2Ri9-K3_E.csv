"It's obvious that this review is not based on any actual usage, and unfortunately is more of a review of the spec sheet.

Sure, a sub-$200 laptop for light browsing sounds great on paper, and on paper it's a decent machine. But in everyday use, even at that price, I would not recommend it at all.

First, and this is a nitpicky issue, is the lack of a slim RJ45 jack or another USB port. A 4 port USB hub resolves this, but you then have to carry it around.

Simply put, the 32GB of eMMC storage for a hard drive is absolutely inadequate for a modern Windows 10 machine.

The OS itself has taken up some much space, updates are unable to unpack and install at all, and simply fail. Sure, this can me mitigated by shuffling data around, turning off hibernation, cleaning up files with Disk Cleanup, but even then I still ran into issues, and even with 6GB free the latest W10 updates failed. An SD card is great for moving personal data, but you cannot offload the OS or singular apps to the SD card. If you could throw in a 128GB microSD card, blow a Windows 10 installation down onto that, now we're in business, but that is not possible.

A lot of people buying these are not tech savy, and will not know how to fix or deal with this. They have to move data or basically reformat every time large Windows updates hit? No. They will get frustrated and go somewhere else, or have a terrible a Windows experience and swear them off. I do not understand Microsoft allowing these cheap laptops with 32GB storage out the door. They are hurting their brand because they are selling a shitty experience in order to slap a WINDOWS sticker on more crappy units flying out of the door and hit sales increase quotas for the quarter, or a .2% uptick in market share. Windows RT was an attempt to somehow mitigate this, but that was a terrible failure. Windows requirements should be 64GB storage minimum. The OS is a good OS, it's just laughable that they've allowed it to be gimped like this because of hardware.

And it's not even like you can pull the drive and throw an SSD in their either. 

In light of that, I have wiped my HP Stream 11 (same guts) and installed Linux Mint, and use a mix of Libre Office and Office365 online apps. Have almost 20GB of storage free on boot, it runs faster, and with TLP installed the battery life is even better.

A new OS completely removed my frustration with this laptop, and turned it into a great all-around laptop/netbook thing. Except for the keyboard, which I have heard good and bad, and think I just got one with a weird spacebar.

Still, would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone outside of tinkerers or people with some tech background.",-0.8748,562
