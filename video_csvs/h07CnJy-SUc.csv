*Trump has a deep relationship with Deutsche Bank. He owed the bank nearly $300 million, which represents almost 50% of his outstanding debt, according to Bloomberg.

A U.S. official familiar with Mueller’s investigation told Reuters that the Special Counsel wants to find out whether Deutsche Bank sold some of Trump’s loans to VEB, a Russian state development bank or other Russian banks that are currently under U.S. and E.U. sanctions.

"Cat A ...America's number one issue is that it makes money from the misfortunes of the citizens. For example..there should not be hunger and people living on the street with all of the land that is available. Long ago black people were promised 40 acres and a mule to plant crops. It never happened. America gives away much needed money to other countries who actually hate us. The moniker ""The American People""..who are they? Can't be natural born citizens because we are treated like we don't matter. America is greedy and non caring. For example if you luck up and become a millionaire..you get taxed up to 39% which means that you can lose up to 390k from EVERY MILLION. Is that fair? Is it justified. Politicians get fat and rich and seem to forget the promises that THEY made to get your vote and getting a one on one is impossible. Toothpaste smiles concealing lies. Intentional lies. Until America is truly for it's own people the people will always live in a world that many commit suicide to leave it. Everyday. To get it back on track the government needs to keep the money at home for AMERICANS. Give the Dreamers citizenship after they have been intensely verified. After that close the gate and go back to the normal procedures for getting American citizenship. Meaning..wait until it's your turn. Stop electing celebrities because just because they are popular on TV does not make them leaders of a nation. Give the homeless the ops to work even though the pay may not be as good. With the wealth of this nation minimum wage should start at $13.50 an hour. Demand that the politicians stop playing ""Big Brother"" and let other countries handle their own problems. If the U.N. doesn't sanction a global involvement then leave it alone. That's why the national debt is so high..the cost of WAR. Provide free healthcare.
Educate instead of incarcerate. Not the heinous crime commiters mind you..but normal stupid stuff. Tax the churches because there is supposed to be a rule of separation of Church and State. The clergy is NOT supposed to get involved in politics which they always do. Analyze the departments such as welfare, child support and social security to see if they are actually abiding by the guidelines laws. Allow the politicians to serve only 2 elected terms then they're done. If this rule applies to the President then it should also include politicians. Make it illegal to operate hate groups and incarcerate those who insist on keeping such hate alive. In this case free speech should be abolished for the rhetoric harms the innocent nationalities. This list is but a starter but I trust that you get my meaning. It was once said that America is like a gleaming castle sitting atop a hill in bright sunlight. Nowadays it's the burnt out shack that hides in the bushes.
America has a serious concussion at this time and only the people can demand the restoration.",0.7366,567
"Cat A ..Eliminate the electoral vote and let the one with the most votes be deemed as the winner. Your vote does not elect a President. The 538 electoral college votes do that.

Might have hand grenades AND a cult leader.  WHY would you not expect that??  In return, we use cyanide gas by the gallons on children????  Go move to north korea.  They're more YOUR kind of people Schumer.  By the time your done whining about President Trump, he will be out of office.  This Country needs a business man right now.  All you do is sleep at the Marriott and have your Congressman breakfast.  I have been an Army Wife now for 14 years and my Husband has been a soldier now for 14 years.  America pays people 14 million dollars to take a wooden stick,  hit a ball, and run in a circle while we as a military family can't even afford a new dryer or a bra I don't have to safety pin together.

Alot of people voted for him.  Get over it.  Why don't you help him and back you President for his term instead of your rallies?  Yeah.... your rallies are just helping my family and our fellow citizens so much.  I bet you can't even admit alot of people voted for him.  Sure, investigate it if you think it wasn't fair or had some interference.  That is your freedom as an American citizen.  Like it was our right as American citizens to vote for him.  AND alot of people did.  I bet your just so mad alot of people voted for him that you can't even admit it.  It's your right to have your anti- rallies Mr. Schumer BUT you really should help out more then just flapping your lips for his next 1 or 2 terms.  You know he is going to serve his term.  Standing there complaining about it isn't helping.  My Husband has deployed so many times for this country.  Hillary Clinton supporters stood there hours for her,  supporting her.  I  CAN'T  BELIEVE she couldn't walk just steps after the election to say ""Thank you"" to her supporters.  I bet some of those people are STILL making that credit card payment on the ticket that meant SO much to them to support her.  She just didn't come out..  WOW..

 So, 207 sovereign states in the world, like 180 of them have freedom.  There’s absolutely no evidence to

"Let me ask this. When Trump was campaigning he kept saying that Mexico was going to pay for that damn wall. Now he's trying to get the Democrats to agree to Billions to pay for it which means that the taxpayer pays for it. Is that fair? He campaigned for it and now he can't deliver so now what?
To even build the thing is a dumb ass idea because there are underground roads UNDER MEXICO that lead into the U.S. Are you dumb enough to believe that those guys don't know construction?
So you actually believe that there is going to be a 2000 mile long wall that separates us from Mexico? If so you should sell some of that shit you're smoking. Trump needs to admit the following...1. I never wanted to be the President and don't know a damn thing about the job. 2. Yes I'm a pussyhound and have paid hush money to keep it quiet. 3. Yes the Russians helped me get elected and was willing to forgive my debt to them if I did a few favors. 4. Hell yeah the benefits of the Oval Office is for sale. 5. I get outside ass because my wife won't give me none. 6. I tweet because I like reading my own thoughts. 7. I'm jealous of Obama because he's smoother than me and his dick is bigger than mine. 8. I hate everybody in the White House and do shit just to keep them in a panic. 9. My hair is a toupee. 10. No I don't like anybody that's not white. It worked for my daddy and it's working for me. 11. I like fast food because I have IBS and it's hard to take a dump sometimes. 12. Yes I molested all of those women who accused me but if I admit it my entire fortune is up for grabs. 13. I'd fuck Sarah Huckabee Sanders but her face reminds me of a gay farmer. 14. I'd like to bone Nancy Pelosi but I heard she farts a lot. 15. I had one more but I started thinking about Pelosi and lost my thought. People think that MAGA means Make America Great Again..or Make America White Again. In truth MAGA means..My Ass Gets Arthritis. And brother that shit hurts like the dickens too!! Well I gotta go now and deal with this shutdown shit. I'd rather have a joint and some cold brewskis with some ol' buds that I know. Fuck you Schumer! I hope one of your balls cramp up while you're speaking to the Press and you pass out. And when you wake up Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to be on top of you butt naked giving you a tongue bath! So there!!",-0.9747,523

"Once again..no one wants to come clean and talk about how the process works..so I guess that leaves me to educate those that don't understand...
   On Monday..after more than 2 days if the government doesn't reopen..the Senate goes to what is known as cloture..that requires 16 signatures to then put it to a 60 person vote to end the shutdown with something in place..
    Now if the democrats in the Senate don't want to play nice..and continue to push the envelope then the nuclear option can be put in play not only to reopen the government but to pass any bill put before the Senate..
   For those of you who don't know what the nuclear option is..it simply means that instead of 60 votes..in the Senate..you only need 51 to get things done..
   Now with the way our corrupt Congress has been running for decades in the Senate...it's high time to abolish this filibuster every time the minority party decides to shut down the government which in this case is the Democratic party..
   Because the Senate Republicans don't have 60 votes..they could not stop the minority Senate Democratic party from shutting down the government..so for the last 100 years or so a fillibuster provision was provided in the Constitution for the minority party in the Senate to obstruct and override the ruling majority party in the Senate from not only passing any bills but also to shut down the government itself..
   Now Trump is a business man and not a career politician...he will only do what is in the best interest of the American people..
    Trump wants the nuclear option to be used by the Republicans in the Senate..in fact he's wanted that while he was a candidate and first elected as president..
   Trump and rightfully so never saw the sense of why things were always being held up to pass into law and it's because of archaic corrupt laws like the fillibuster which gives a handful of people power to hold an entire nation hostage anytime they want!!
   So Trump is essentially correct to say get rid of this fillibuster and just pass bills the simple majority way or 51 votes...if the majority is elected to represent the people who voted them in the first place..then let them be able to do their job..
  now getting back to Donald Trump..he is now in a beautiful position if he wants to..to force the Senate Republicans to go nuclear because Trump is never going to accept a half ass compromise by the democrats..he will reject the bill at his desk and toss it back to Congress..as many times as it takes to get it to his satisfaction..
   it's not enough of a reason anymore to keep the fillibuster going just because Dems and Republicans go back and forth as the majority party in the Senate..
   When bills don't get passed and the government shuts down.. regards of political party affiliation..nobody benefits...
    Besides..the majority party should have nothing to worry about..if their job is getting done correctly..then a fillibuster should not be needed to stop them at every turn and we the people should and ought to be able to be confident and smart enough to send the right people to Congress to do the job we elected them to do in the first place...",0.9938,617

And finally 20% for corporations and anyone making over 20 mil. Stop the yearly refunds. Dismantle the IRS for it will serve no purpose. Reduce the current 12% social security tax deduction to 6%. Allow anyone over the age of 55 to cash out if they wish to. Cap the current welfare system to a 2 year assistance limit with the recipients being required to at least work a part time job while getting child care vouchers. Evaluate all SSI recipients for most are milking the system. Do a hard target check on all of the DACA people and IF they can pass all the the requirements then they get citizenship. The DACA people ONLY then close the gates. After that if an illegal gets caught deport them and if there is a second offense its 5 years hard labor in prison in a remote area where you bust big rocks into little ones. Stop all Diplomatic Immunity and if a diplomat screws up prosecute the hell out of them. To hell with the State Department and their international embarrassment. Politicians can only work 2 terms just like the President's term limits. Get rid of the electoral vote and let the candidate with the most votes win.
Stop the tax payer payments for rogue politicians who commit crimes. Require that anyone running for office has a proven track record of leadership and under no circumstances allow celebrities to be elected because America ain't no TV show. Also,
with the tax deductions that aren't repaid give free health care to the people of this country like every other country in the civilized world does. Stop getting involved in wars that are not a threat to the USA. Not our business. Allies should be those who bring cold beer to BBQs!! Keep American dollars in America and stop giving it away for that act was not approved by the American taxpayers!! And stop lying about acting on behalf of the American People for we don't even get included in the loop to let us know what's really going on.

Well I clearly remember Nancy Pelosi making this statement..""We may be on different sides of the aisle but we're all in the same gang"". So you are right. But check this out..of all of the millions of votes that are cast for choosing a President they really don't count. The actual decision comes from 538 holders of the electoral college vote which actually was established in the late 1800s. Whoever gets the most of those votes becomes President.
If people really knew the truth the polls would be as empty as a ghost town. All of this bull about the government being shut down is just to get the people scared. The only ones that are actually voted in by the people are senators, mayors, governors. Period. As George W. Bush said..""Being in politics will make you lose your soul"".
