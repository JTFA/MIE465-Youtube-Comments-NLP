"For those who are wondering, I’ve come to a conclusion. When you don’t mix your batter enough, it breaks when you lift your spatula up to test it. When you mix the batter just right, it falls off in a ribbon. When you over mix it, it breaks apart just like when you don’t mix it enough. This was my first try making macaroons. EVER. And my macaroons are in the oven right now. This conclusion may not be right and it’s definitely not coming from an expert. I just tested it out to see how it would look like if you over mixed.",0.7717,125
