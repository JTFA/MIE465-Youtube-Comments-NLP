"+Milkyway2099 We're in agreement there. I felt that the deaths of Tripp, Rosalind, and Mace all came too early, and Mace's was the only one that was even properly handled. I like the idea of him going out with a heroic sacrifice doing the thing that he never could do in the real world (and yes, I understand that his death would only work in the Framework because he needed to have powers, and I don't wish that the Framework story arc had been longer, so I realize the sticky scenario I've created, and I don't have a great solution for that). Tripp's death was rushed and he didn't really die sacrificing himself for anything, and then his death was also overshadowed for the next couple episodes by Skye's new powers. As I already said before, I think Rosalind was too interesting for her early death to be the best route they could have taken with her.",0.0384,175

¬†These are all good points for any show but they don't really apply to Ms Zimmer.
¬†Mr Colbert asked her, ""Do you 'WATCH' any reality shows?"", that means CURRENTLY as opposed to asking ""Have you ever watched a reality show?. She answered NO to his question. If he asked the latter question all your points would be valid.


¬†It also can't be inferred from his one question that she did not do ANY research and development for her show. Especially when she described her research right on the show; Mr C made a joke about it ""What was that like, a police ride along?""LOL. Also before submitting a show into a network you have to show your R&D, with your script, financial backing (executive producer) etc.
¬†

¬†I've have also noticed Mr Colbert becomes what you call ""irritated"" anytime any guest cusses on the show, I don't think that was specific to her. CBS is billed as a family network with a 'morality standard act' (agree or disagree with that one) clause in their programming. When a network, especially one defined as ¬†'family oriented', breaks infractions, they are fined by the FCC. Celebrities think they are cool cussing on CBS but I think it stresses Mr C out more than it irritates.",-0.7707,257

reactions are often real. reality shows are decades old. hundreds of hours of unscripted footage when edited down to create a narrative that would exist otherwise is what reality shows do. its entertainment. Some shows do nothing but let things happen. They just pick the set pieces. Others are a bit more manipulative.,0.3506,60
