@Mafia07407 I agree with Mafia08407. The film was created in such a way that you can't really take a side. ,0.5423,23
"@Mafia07407 Kind of an unjust comparison, considering that Hoffman has significantly more screen time in the film. Roger Ebert makes a good point that the viewer is never forced to take sides - both father and mother have their respective flaws, and in the end it turns out that they are equally wonderful parents to Billy.",0.8215,60

"@greg5566 yea, I mean... that's just my opinion, but I think they both did a good job. However... I think he did a bit better of a job lol",0.9081,34
Brilliant acting by both actors. Just brilliant.,0.8225,9
Estuve siempre convencido que la copa estallando en la pared... fue un agregado de ultimo minuto. ELLA SE ENOJO? SI. Los dos estaban pasando momentos feos en sus vidas. Esta película me movilizó mucho. He sido testigo de muchas peleas de estas. Jamás tiraría una copa a la pared. Adoro a estos dos... he aprendido mucho viendo sus movies.,0.0,69

"MERYL STREEP IS SOOOO AMAZING IN THIS MOVIE!!...EVEN IF IT'S DUSTIN'S MOVIE, SHE OBVIOUSLY GETS ALL THE ATTENTION :D

"No she didn't.
If you watched the Kramer Vs. Kramer special features they talk about this scene and Hoffman said he told the cameraman he was going to do it but didn't tell Meryl so her reaction was completely real.
Stop making stuff up.",-0.4529,48
Only him and the camera man knew what he was going to do. Dustin said that during that scene he actually got really angry at Meryl.,-0.5563,28

"That moment with the glass is cringeworthy! You can see that he moves the glass and then, realising that he intends to smash it against the wall but can't because he's now moved it in front of the centerpiece, has to move it back! It lacks any kind of spontaneity because it's planned!",0.0,58
"To clear anything up about the wine glass,(this is according to IMDB's trivia facts of the movie), the only person Hoffman warned about hitting the wine glass was the cameraman to make sure he got the shot. Supposedly, Streep did not know about it. Maybe she might have picked up on it, but, again, this is according to IMDB.",0.2263,71
"Well, Meryl still gets angry about this incident 30 years later. You can't work like that as an actor - it's rude, and irresponsible. Sorry all you so-called ""Method actors"" out there, but acting does not mean beating the shit out of yourself and your colleagues. Hoffman was being an egocentrical, ego-tripping prick.",0.3324,63
"Yeah, you tell that bitch!",-0.4389,7
"at 0:40 he moves the glass out of reflex, then remembers he wants to do that glass throwing thing, and so moves it back. Its so obvious it annoys me everytime I watch it, they should have done SOMETHING lol",-0.0679,44
dustin hoffman did prove to be the better actor throughout the film. His choices and sublty steals the film,-0.1027,20

"this is directed at anyone who says that the throwing of the glass wasnt staged:it was.if you have the dvd go to special fetures or whatever it is and watch the making of the movie,dustin says he planned it down to when he threw it with the help of the camera man.meryl said in the making of interview that she was pissed off because no one had told her it was coming.",-0.25,77
