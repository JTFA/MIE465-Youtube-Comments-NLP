In middle school the principle would play flight of the bumblebees in the speakers when lunch ended to let us know lunch is over and that we had to run to our next class before the song ended. At the moment i always hated it but now that I look back at it I feel like it was really fun to watch because the song would start playing and everybody would panic and start running as fast as they could and if they didn't get to their classes on time they would have to go to detention which really sucked.
