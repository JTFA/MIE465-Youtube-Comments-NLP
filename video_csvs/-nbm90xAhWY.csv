B-RAD !!!!!! But they‚Äôre not transgenders tho. They‚Äôre drag queens. There is a big difference. It‚Äôs offensive to some people to call a transgender a drag queen and vice verse. But all I know most queens know they are men and want to be men. It‚Äôs just art. It‚Äôs just for fun.,-0.5216,71
"B-RAD !!!!!! I understand some people want conservative values but it‚Äôs a changing world. I think if you maybe met a queen you could see they‚Äôre just people and doing what makes them happy. Just because they‚Äôre a queen doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not men they just are very feminine men. If a lot of these feminine men were forced to be masculine I think it would make them miserable because it is not who they are. It‚Äôs not hurting anyone. I think it would do more harm if we forced people to be who they aren‚Äôt. But then again, they shouldn‚Äôt be surprised when some people have conservative values. Both sides just don‚Äôt get each other, but it‚Äôs important to see there side too. But drag is really just for fun.",0.4958,164
B-RAD !!!!!! When has a queen ever shot up a school? LOL you tried it.,0.6909,19

I promise you none of these men will shoot up a school.",-0.956,74
