"""Even the much older Apple ][ didn't have to do that""... *only* if you specified an autoboot program when you formatted the disk.  For example, if you formatted the disk with INIT HELLO it would look for a program called HELLO when you turned on the computer.

Of course, HELLO could just be a program that doesn't actually *do* anything, in which case you still have to LOAD (or BLOAD) programs like normal.

On the Commodore, the disk drive was a ""smart"" drive... it's literally a computer by itself, with its own RAM, ROM, and CPU.  For a long time, *nobody else* had smart drives like that... you either needed a special interface card or you had to load the disk operating system into the computer's RAM (or both).  So the autoboot function was built into the interface card or the disk operating system.

Commodore's disk operating system was built into the disk drive, not into the computer.  And *that* is why it doesn't have an autoboot feature.  The benefit is that you get to use *all* the computer's RAM.  You don't have to reserve part of your RAM for the disk drive to use.",0.9081,236

"+Amerigo Costa  I think you're right.  The Commodore trademark is, as of 16 December 2013, officially owned by a company called ""C= Holdings"" (formerly Commodore International B.V.)  Their trademark specifically includes the hardware, which probably includes the labels.  If so, you could not replicate the label without first paying a licensing fee and being licensed by C= Holdings.

(The trademark does *not* include apparel, so if you want to print T-shirts with the Commodore logo on them, go right ahead.)

EDIT: Confirmed.  The label is almost certainly part of the trademark.  I was checking to see if RMC could get new keys to go with that new case, and I found some... but the guys who made them said that they didn't have the license to make a new Commodore key that was an exact match for the original Commodore logo.  If they can't print keys with the Commodore logo, it's a pretty safe assumption that you can't make an exact match of the label without paying for a production license from C= Holdings.",0.9175,207

"@ElectronAsh, Yeah, the aca500plus allows for booting from fd1 external floppy drive. It makes more sense (surely?) to have a gotek in an external floppy enclosure that you can boot form, thereby never needing to touch the real floppy fd0 internal drive. So it is all reversible. I say a patina and its provenance are all part of the browning of the old computer cases. Any mods could instead be done to a new case. Fair enough, an amiga may need to have the hood popped so as to do maintenance inside and therefore a replacement case could be the answer (while the original is kept safe and not lost). The obvious disclaimer applies that people can do what they wish with their own computers. I wasn't all that overjoyed to see the c64 bass guitar Jeri Ellsworth made, however, I never ""moaned"" and certainly wouldn't want to be a party pooper.

"As for the Apple II: Of course they did.  I just mentioned the whole INIT {name} thing, right?  It would automatically format a blank disk, and then save the BASIC program in memory to the disk.  When you turned on the computer, the first thing it did was check to see if there was a program with the name you specified.  If there was, it would load and run it automatically.  Of course, this only worked for Applesoft BASIC programs; if you wanted it to automatically run a machine language program instead, you had to use a sector editor and directly change the contents of track $00, sector $0D, byte $42 from $00 to $14 (this tells it to use BRUN instead of RUN).

As for the Atari 1050 drive being 'smart'... that's true, but you *still* had to load DOS into the system RAM, which is why you couldn't use a disk drive unless you had at least 48k of RAM.  You probably didn't notice, because by the time the Atari 800 reached the market, the price of RAM had started to drop, so eventually *all* Atari computers shipped with 48k already installed.  The only reason you *wouldn't* have 48k is if you got a computer that was manufactured in the first year or so.

Not only that, but because Atari DOS used 128 bytes per sector (instead of 256 bytes per sector like *everyone else* did), the older Atari 810 disk drive only held 90k per disk, compared to Commodore's 170k per disk or Apple's 140k.  The 1050 supported Enhanced Density disks, which had a limit of 130k.  Out of that 90k (or 130k), about 38k was eaten by DOS.SYS, DUP.SYS, RAMDISK.COM and MEM.SAV, leaving you with just 51.5k (or 91.5k).  You could delete MEM.SAV for more space, *if* you didn't mind losing the program you were typing *every time* you used the DOS menu (or bypass the DOS menu and use XIO commands like XIO 253,#1,0,0,""D1:"" which would format a blank disk.)",0.9213,416

You don't need any kind of specialist suppliers for stuff like that.
But you might need to look a bit harder if you need to replace something like the SID chip or even the CPU.

Technically WDC still manufactures brand new 65c02, and the 16 bit 65c802 and 65c816 chips, but while those are great for messing around with, I don't think they can be used as direct replacements of chips in older systems.

It just seems logical to me to add heatsinks to many chips that often run hotter than say 45 degrees C, as it should increase the chips' life span.

It does come down to how much you want to spend, of course.

If you're trying to use Atari BASIC, and your first disk (D1:) does not have DOS.SYS on it, the computer displays the message ""Error: No DOS"" and then just sits there and does nothing.  The reason you don't remember having to load the disk operating system is because it does it automatically.

Oh, and by the way, the Atari also did not automatically copy the DOS files to a freshly formatted disk.

Yes, the C64 power bricks do tend to fail a lot.
I'm sure the potting is trapping the heat in the case too, because the 5 Volt regs are usually pretty hefty, so would normally be overrated for the current draw and dissipation.

The best ""C64 saver"" circuits by far are the solid state ones btw (with a MOSFET instead of a relay or simple fuse, which don't react anywhere near fast enough.)

I believe that the devices from Mr bwack are full solid state, so that's good.

There are also some C64 savers that let you use a standard wall wart or 12V power brick, but it is a bit of a challenge to generate the isolated 9V AC output from DC.

Those designs should also include reverse-polarity protection as well though, as it would make it possible to plug in the wrong PSU.
Again, the better C64 Saver circuits actually include that protection as an inherent thing. You just need to find the good ones. ;)",0.9179,220

Yeah, that's a possible method.

The ""3M"" tape that came with some small heatsinks a few weeks ago had the backing paper on it, but of course could still have been fake.

The real thermal tape has more of a squishy feel, though. So, although it may not be ideal (if it is fake), as long as the tape is at least a ""thermal"" type, it's still better than nothing.

As Mr RetroManCave said, it's possibly more important that the heatsinks don't fall off easily, as that can short something out, or damage components.",-0.819,115

Hahaha - I just watched your vid. :)

Yes, there is always an argument for NOT retr0brighting a classic computer (or anything else), but I can see why people choose to do it.

If it can be proven to me that a safe method exists that doesn't cause the plastic to go brittle nor cause blotches / marbling, then I think it's fair enough for people to try it on their own machines.

What I am personally REALLY against though, is when people cut or drill huge gaping holes into the cases of older retro machines unnecessarily.

The latest trend is to cut a huge hole in the tops of original Amiga cases, so an LCD or OLED can be fitted for the Gotek drives etc.

And that's why I created this little mod. ;)

Thanks! Of course, not everyone has them on hand, so it should be noted that ""If you have one, try this method, but it's okay if you don't have one""

Also another tip, if your circuit seems to malfunction for no reason (no broken traces, chips are all fine, no rogue components, etc) use rubbing alcohol and toothbrush to wash the flux and contacts. If you have 99% variant, you may use soak-and-scrub method, provided that denaturing agent does not include solvents like acetone or toluene. (Sanitary products do not contain such agents and isopropanol usually does not include them)
For my Yamaha synth repair, the original board was absolutely caked in flux for some reason (I guess they just dipped the bottom of the board in flux then tossed it into solder pot) and board turned into sticky mess when I tried to clean the contacts, so I used alcohol to dissolve away all the permanent marker markings and flux that covered the entire board away and finished it by rinsing it in the distilled water, blowing the water off with air duster and putting it in a drying chamber made with cheap plastic container with lids made to accept low-heat air from hair dryer.",0.2794,233

The main problem with the harsher treatments is that it removes the emollients from the plastics, hence the brittleness.

I was around for model M which was visually already very different from ZX (and when the the rest of the western world was already beginning to rock their x86es), and that model is connected to my childhood memories by a steel chain. Right at the edge of the so-called velvet revolution Skalica made the last and very pointless attempt to move a little closer to its competition attaching a 3.5"" drive to model M, which was called Didaktik Compact. They'd call it "" a gate to a world of professional computers"". If only, if only... It of course never took off. It's pity there's nobody like you doing videos about those forgotten computers.

But, be aware of the fake ""3M"" branded stuff too.

It's common to see that stuff when ordering pre-taped heatsinks from China etc., and I haven't yet looked into ways of identifying the fake stuff.

btw, the black anodised heatsinks genuinely dissipate the heat better. :p

Some people will argue that machines usually worked OK without heatsinks for over 30 years, but if you really care about preserving them for longer, then I can't see the harm in spending a bit extra on a few heatsinks for the hotter chips.

What often kills chips is actually the thermal cycling (and I don't mean riding a bicycle while wearing a jumper. lol)

The expansion and contraction of the chip package and leadframe can eventually cause the wire bonds to break.

The silicon chips themselves are normally very robust unless supplied too much voltage, or zapped by ESD (like the C64 CIA chips, if you touch the joystick port pins).

The chips can still have problems with things like moisture ingress though.",0.8961,201
