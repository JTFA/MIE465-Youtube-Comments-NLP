"Bluetooth has many possibilities.  But transferring music isn’t one of those.  Most compression formats are too lossy.  You can hear it in blind tests (at least if you are a musician or similarly into sound, aren’t too old, and have headphones or stereo equipment of quality... No those speaker cables that costs $1000/m is a scam.)  The best compression format is AptX that are close to lossless.   But unfortunately Apple is stubborn and won’t pay those extra cents it would cost to use this technology.  If they aim for wireless and quality they should use the best technology   They use the best technology for their displays.

They're ready to believe every Bull$#}t they are being told, that it's for the consumers ""benefit"", that they need the space for extra thin phones (1-2 millimeters thinner - big deal!), better cameras or whatever lame excuse. In reality why would you want to add more complexity (Bluetooth Sucks as this video explains, an extra set of batteries that you have to keep always charged on the headset, radio interference from other devices - plus an extra drain from your phone's battery!).
