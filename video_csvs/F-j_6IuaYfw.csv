If you're interested to answer please comment down below and i'll take note 😊.  I'll be asking the questions here, but if you want to answer here or in private just e-mail me!

"I don't really feel there is a new and old Wong Fu... I think you have slowly developed and moved on through the years (rather than a drastic change like I feel Taylor did). Your journey has been gradual and although I miss seeing Ted more, I don't feel there's a huge difference in content of videos. Sure, you have a better quality of video making and storytelling (and I expect you should be improving through the years =P), but your core is still the same!

"I never like Taylor Swift. The number of boyfriends she broke up with is ridiculous. She was a country music singer. Now she’s becoming more of a musician with more explicit themes. She will probably dress up as a stripper in her future mvs. If I meet Taylor Seift in person, I’ll tell her to shave off her hair. Or put Nair on her head. I can imagine her being bald and hairless. I do like women, but I can’t meet and like every single one of them. There are a lot of women I knew before whom I don’t want to meet with again. I don’t think Taylor Swift has the motivation to get married. She makes boyfriends as a part of her game. She uses them to make her own songs and have a successful music career. I predict that she’ll go into hip hop and integrate into her songs. I would not be friends with Taylor Swift unless she experiences menopause. Taylor Swift is going crazy nowadays. She’ll be as crazy as Nicki Minaj. I despise American people in entertainment industry.",-0.8561,218
