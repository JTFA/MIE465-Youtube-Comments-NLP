"1:48... that straightening out there? didnt know driving in a straight line was drifting. Maybe the Guinness World Record dude fall asleep? Not trying to be the negative one here, but if theres an OFFICIAL record for this, you should be following some guidelines as to what a ""drift"" is. Ask FD judges what happens when a car straightens out. Yes the BMW fueling the BMW attempting the Drift Record hit it, but it did LEAVE drift.
