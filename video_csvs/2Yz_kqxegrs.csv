"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends! 

John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved this world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. 

So friends, Jesus LOVES you!

He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you! 

The Lord came down in the Person of Jesus to die, and 3 days later, rise again!

He did this because of His Sheer Love for us! 

Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him! (John 6:37, paraphrased)

So my friends, come to Jesus today! 

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He will forgive you, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

You don't need a lot of faith or a fancy prayer to make Jesus your Lord and Savior. 

Simply call upon Him from the heart, with mustard seed size faith. 

He will hear you speedily! 
You will be saved! For all those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13) 
Hallelujah!

Shalom, friends!",0.9967,221

"You have heard God LOVES you. But is it true and do you believe it? It most definitely is true. In fact, He loves you so much that for a time, He gave up what was most dearest to Him: His only Son (Jesus). Jesus offered His life as a payment for the punishment that we sinners deserve (there is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood). Jesus the Christ died in our place on a cross some 2000 years ago and then defeated death, rising on the third day. We can escape hell and receive heaven via God's free gift of forgiveness and eternal life. ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.""

    Don't be deceived, trust in the Saviour Jesus and follow Him. Jesus said ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life."" God's free gift to man is eternal life. We have all sinned (lied, stolen, lust, used God's name as a curse word etc...), so we are guilty of sin against God. First admit you are a sinner, then ask God to forgive you. Accept and believe what Jesus has done for you and start following Him. Find a good, Bible-believing, Christian Church where you will be encouraged to follow Jesus Christ. Then share the GOOD NEWS with others. ❤️❤️❤️ (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9834,335
