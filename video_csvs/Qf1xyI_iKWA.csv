If we were to take an extreme for instance, to paint this example, and tax corporations at 90% that wouldn't just mean that the corporation owner makes less money, it means the corporation is basically unable to grow any larger (and most likely will go out of business). You need capital to grow a company, and the government taking all your capital from a private company, that is forced by market demand to stay efficient or otherwise go out of business, and reinvesting it in what's often very inefficient government programs doesn't seem like a productive distribution of resources.",0.2023,174

"Hank: When you mention excess money a corporation has being taxed as if it were income, you left something out.  It does get taxed as income while its in the hands of the corporation, then it is taxed AGAIN, also as income, when it is written out as a paycheck to an employee (even if that employee is the CEO/owner, and even if that CEO/owner is the sole employee), so it gets taxed twice.  Many corporations get around this by giving out their extra profits at the end of the year as dividends to their share holders, so it avoids the end-of-year income tax AND the payroll tax, because it is classified as capitol gains and taxed at a flat 15%.  When you hear of things like Warren Buffet paying less taxes than his secretary, this is why.  Most CEOs and high ups in large companies receive the bulk of their yearly income as dividends.  Obviously you had to simplify a lot of things otherwise this video would be hours long, but, that happens to be one I'm aware of.",0.6382,205

I'd like to write this letter to Hank, and I would appreciated any other commentators assistance in making it view-able to him. I'd like to take the next few paragraphs to prove that conservatives are people too. Their ideas are not  latched on to randomly, and may even have value.

Dear Hank,

I've been stuck as an assistant/general manager for almost my whole working life. I have spent ten years in middle management out of my fourteen years of working. I have never made more than $3/hr above minimum wadge, but that is a topic for another time. I want to talk about P&L worksheets today.

As you said you are a business owner, and I've heard you wax poetically about how much you love and appreciate your employees. You need them for the labor they provide, but you see people first. People with hopes, ambitions, and needs of their own. I also like to help my employees achieve a better quality of life. I try to accommodate everyone's availability. I train people personally when they're struggling with their work. I establish trust by giving responsibility to anyone who asks for it, and mentoring them so maintain upward mobility. I get to know their goals and push for them to pursue them. I've encouraged a lot of my best workers to go back to college, get degrees, and even campaign for them to get better jobs knowing full well what I was loosing when they did leave.  I've even helped with homework.

I work very hard to provide the very best for my employees (Yes, I do expect them to try their best in return. Fair is fair). That also means I need to keep the lights on. If the businesses I've managed over the years didn't pull a consistent profit, then I wouldn't be able to provide the best for my employees. I'd like to tell a story about that, if you'd pardon a little anecdotal evidence.

In 2015 I started as the GM of a fast food restaurant. It was 31 store independent franchise, started by a husband and wife team that had met at this very fast food chain and eventually opened their own franchise back in the mid 90s (cute story I know). Like them, I started with a preexisting store that was financially insolvent and a staff that didn't know how to do their jobs and were unmotivated to learn. We both succeed managed to turn things around, pulling profits for the locations and filling the schedule with happy employees. There were talks of moving me up to a district manager position and the owners were in the process of building and entirely new district of stores to make room for a new DM as well as whole lot of new employees.

In the summer of 2016 we became aware of a public question to appear on the state ballot and a federal regulation that was going to become effective on January 1st 2017. The state question was whether to raise minimum wadge $1/hr each year for the next 5 years to come effective on the 1st of the year. The federal regulation was that all workers making salary who work more than 40 hours a week need to be paid overtime for their work. When November came and the state question passed in a landslide vote, we knew.

The owners hadn't been expecting either change to the law, and were severely over-leveraged. They couldn't afford to keep many of the stores they already had, let alone build more. Our customers reacted with jubilation. We had never been busier than when the vote results were announced. People just went nuts, spending incredible amounts of money. I did my 1st ever greater than $1,000 order in the weeks leading up to January. There ended up being 3 others before the end of the surge. All the while we were cutting hours left and right trying to build up enough money to survive the changes that were coming. I have never been more tired in my life, and my staff was miserable.

I know what you're thinking, $1.00 ... big whoop! I had a staff of 23. I was required to work 50 hours a week, but I made salary so I actually worked 56. My assistants worked 40 hours a week. Full time staff worked 35 hours a week (though I gave some 40 because I had the budget to). Any minors were capped at 12.5 hours a week by the government. This meant from the raises alone, I had to come up with and additional $784 a week, or another $40,768 a year just to keep my staff's current hours. On top of that the lease on the restaurant's plot jumped from $10,000 a month to $11,000 a month. Our trucks also got more expensive. Some of the items we ordered saw as much as a 10% increase in cost. Considering I spent close to $14,000 a month on food before the change, that was a massive punch to my budget. We didn't raise our prices however, to try and cover all our extra costs. I knew what was coming.

It didn't happen all at once, but sales began to decline after January. I was converted to an hourly position suddenly I was making $15/hr as a GM which meant I was a massive liability to my store's profitability. I started working off the clock. I had to lay off a few employees, and slash the hours of others - but it didn't make much of dent. My labor expenditures in 2016 where at around 23% of my store's revenue on average, in 2017 the average was 33% (Revenue mind you, not profit).

The city I worked in started to shut down too. Every time another restaurant in town went bankrupt, laid off its staff, and closed - we saw a slight uptick in business as their customers came to us. It never did stop the steady decline in sales. Other stores were closing too, gas stations, a hotel, a bunch of hobby shops, and even a bank. On my way to work every morning I saw new faces on street corners invariably holding cardboard signs saying ""Laid off, newly homeless, anything helps."" I had to call the cops several times to break up fist fights between people vying for the best street corners to beg from. It started as trickle, eventually on a daily basis, I had men and women in their 50s or older coming in and asking for a minimum wadge job. Most had a decent salary job before 1/1/17, but had been laid off or converted to hourly and had their hours cut. Almost all of them had families they no longer could feed.

All the while, the newspapers and local news stations went on and on about how successful the new minimum wadge had been. Meanwhile the homeless were being rounded up and sent from cites up north and sent on buses down to my city because their services where being stretch to the breaking point.

It feels like 2008 all over again.

I don't have all the numbers. I don't have all the facts. I don't think I know everything. I do know what happened to my movie theater back in 2008 and what's happening to my restaurant now. Everything got more expensive, lots of people lost their jobs, and overall everyone made less money. About a month ago I left the restaurant, and started a different career. I was depressed. I had no hope of moving up as the franchise was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy every month. My staff was miserable, overworked, and despite the change to minimum wadge - underpaid.

I had basically no shift coverage. On a night were I would have normally scheduled 10, I instead had 6. The same amount of work was expected to get done, there was just less people to do it. Everyone's pay rate saw a raise - but everyone's hours had to be dropped since revenue was also dropping. Again, I had to keep the lights on. It all came to a head when one of my assistant managers told me he was considering suicide because he didn't want to go to bed hungry another night only to be woken up by the daily deluge of collections calls. He'd apparently also dropped out of college when I wasn't paying attention, and he felt like the future held no prospects. I'd also been ignoring my own emotional turmoil just trying to keep everything limping along.

I'm ashamed that I left after that. He's still alive, I check in every now and then - but he definitely isn't doing any better. I had a happy staff, but that changed.

That's my anecdote, I'm sorry it was such a downer. I'm still struggling with it myself. If I hadn't made my point clearly enough yet, I'll try and be a little more direct.

Hank. You love your employees, I do too. You want the very best for them. If your business suddenly came into a large amount of money. Money that was consistently coming in month after month and earning that money didn't mean more work for your employees. You wouldn't need to expand your operation to meet higher demands, you wouldn't need to reinvest in, and you wouldn't need to give it to anyone else. You could just keep it.

What would you do with more money for your business? I know what I wouldn't have done. I wouldn't have fired several employees, slashed everyone else's hours, and forced everyone to pick up slack caused by lack of shift coverage - driving what few employees I had left to exhaustion and despair. I get the feeling you might be inclined to do something nice for your staff, throw a pizza party or something. Maybe hire somebody to take some of the workload off your current employees.

Sincerely

A guy who has no idea how my state is going to survive the next 4 bumps to minimum wadge and is more than a little of explaining that I'm not evil just because I lean a little conservative.

Which part of my argument's wrong?

My argument consisted of two points:
1) Republicans want to cut taxes for the 1% 
2) They want to offset lost revenue by gutting the social safety net

You already admitted #1 was true several times, so you can't say that part of my argument's wrong. As for #2, it's a fact they're trying to gut the social safety net. They've already tried making deep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid through the Obamacare and tax bills. I'll provide articles below for proof. So, you can't say that part of my argument's wrong, either. So then what part was wrong?

""This isn't an argument.""
It is, actually. An argument's defined as ""an exchange of diverging or opposite views,"" so yeah, that's exactly what this was. You're a fool. I'm done here.

"One thing: The money from taxes is not what the government uses to pay off debts. They print money to meet their obligations and then they tax only enough to keep inflation and unemployment low enough that money continues to flow freely through the system. Tax ""revenue"" and budget expenditures don't need to be the same, because there is no reason for a country with a sovereign currency to pay down debts as long as they can bring in enough money through taxes and investments to stabilize the currency and the overall economy. 

Of course, there is a valid argument for why any society, regardless of taxation scheme, which relies on exploiting workers (capital gains), commodity production, and market exchange facilitated by money is inherently unstable and requires periodic collapses in the value of capital to keep money moving through the system. We could have a society where there were no capital gains or capitalists and the workers owned the means of production collectively. They could then decided how much labor would need done to meet the needs of everyone in the world. No one would have to pay taxes: the able bodied workers would just have to work slightly longer (but much less than they do now) to meet the needs of those who are unable to work.",-0.9217,240

"This is all that needs said about additional tax rules:  ""The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip right through your fingers.""

The IRS needs to be abolished, the federal government needs to learn to do with less (thus giving more policy and revenue control back to individual states and the people who reside there) and the ludicrously unfair progressive tax system needs to be sent back to the fiery chasm from whence it came (i.e. the Revenue Act signed into law by Woodrow Wilson over a hundred years ago).  The top 10% of income earners pay 70% (the top 1% owing a whopping 40%) of federal taxes instead of being able to reinvest that income literally anywhere else they see fit and damn-near half of all tax-payers pay absolutely no income tax whatsoever.

And yet the rich somehow don't pay their fair share?  I fall into the income tax bracket which pays no federal income tax and even I am willing to point out the kind of class warfare this tax system engenders.  There are things in the Republican tax plan that are welcome changes (abolishing state/local income tax deductions, lowering the corporate tax rate [currently highest in the world], rebalancing tax rates) and there are others that just keep the wheels of this over-complicated nightmare spinning and spinning and even make things worse in certain respects.  I get Hank's frustration with the Republicans on this but to pretend that Democrats would be offering anything better is laughable.
