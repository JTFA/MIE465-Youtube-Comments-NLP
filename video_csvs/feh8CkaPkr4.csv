"For all of you non-natives, NYC includes the outer boroughs as well. Apartments in Manhattan cost more because you're paying for the location rather than the apartment itself. If you want to live here, search for apartments in Queens and the Bronx as they have lower prices for larger spaces (generally 2-3 bedroom.) The commute isn't as bad getting into Manhattan as you would think. I live in Queens and it took me about 45 mins to get to my high school in Chelsea on a good train day.",0.714,98

I was ok with everything til she said the neighbors have to repeatedly ask  her to lower the noise.

"I'm a New Yorker, and i'm telling you for the amount of rent you pay for that tiny apartment, you could get a roomier 1 bedroom apartment for cheaper. Harlem, Manhattan period rent is sky high, for an apartment the size of a shoe box. You would be better of getting a 1 bedroom apartment in another borough, that's cheaper and bigger. Or look into buying a CO-OP apartment, where you could be a shareholder of your apartment!!!",0.5229,90
