"This rocks - would be good for a lot of different fume collectors (soldering, bonding etc.).  One thing I'd add would be a suction gauge (search ""Air Cleaner Filter Gauge"")  between the filter and fan so you can tell when the filter is plugged up and needs replacement ( less than $20 on Amazon).",0.5719,66
