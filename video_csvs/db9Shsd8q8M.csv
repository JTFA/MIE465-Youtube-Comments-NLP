"Honestly I loved this song and i recall saying to myself hmm wonder if  Childish G sounds this way Live cause todays artist are suspect. You know the studio artist that rely on that board lol then there is Mr. Gambino Marvin Gaye son jk. Childish Gambino my, my, my very rich in soulful adlib falsetto such range such depth.  I love music I can feel. I dont like to bash and speak badly yet the Geammys lacked vision an good vibes the song collections wasnt hitting the core. Also Kesha performance was just ok people were like Omg the next day. I would arrange a show for the masses took the same artist yet would be more on they ass on song selections. Childish Gambino is a Bad Muther Fucker #inthatorderüëçüíãüí™‚ù§‚úå",0.0282,147
