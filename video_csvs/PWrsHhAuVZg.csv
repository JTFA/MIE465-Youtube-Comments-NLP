IW is an adaptation of the Comics, in the comics there are fodder armies.

There's Thanos... The Black Order... and the Outriders (the four-armed aliens). The outriders are often deployed as scouts. They have tactile telepathy, so they can read your mind by touching you. Then, if they don't also kill you, they return with the info they reap to they're master. They might just be a scout army tasked with discovering the location of the soul gem. So ya... that's not the climax. Also, the charging shot of the heroes at the end comes AFTER that big battle with the outriders, because...

"I can sort of see where Taylor's coming from in his question about the cannon fodder in movies.  I think the thing is that the movies recently seem to have a lot of this happening.  In that I mean we just had JL with the Parademons, but we also had Thor Ragnarkok with Hela's undead army, but this year we also had WW with the Nazi's, GotG 2 fighting the Sovereign, Transformers, Kingsman, hell even Lego Batman had it. And those are just the superhero movies this year so not counting Dunkirk and others.  Going back to the 60's when Spartacus came out I'm pretty sure you didn't have a dozen plus big budget movies with the sort of battles we see all the time these days and the reason is that back then they had to do it with paid extras ... there was no CGI.  You couldn't pay a few guys in a room to digitally create an army of thousands for you.  Because it's become so easy to do that though we get it in every big budget action movies.  

So I see what John is saying that it's an old Hollywood trope, and it is, on a much smaller scale, but Taylor too has a point.  It loses it's impact now because we get a dozen or more movies every year doing it where as back in the day it was a spectacular because they were few and far between.",-0.5836,264

People talk about Civil War as if it is incredible but nothing of any worth actually happens, they get into a fight and are all friends at the end. Literally nothing changes in the MCU.

This is just my opinion but continue with WW 2 for its 2019 release, focus on solo movies and do JL 2 in 5 years if everything works out. If they truly want to reboot it after AM next year, you need to wait a least 3 years and kick off with Batman in 2021 or 2022.",0.9371,136

"I respect your opinions guys, but we're gonna have to disagree on this one.

I can watch Star Wars and be entertained enough. I'll watch The Last Jedi in cinemas, I liked The Force Awakens, but found it a bit similar story wise to A New Hope. I am interested to see where they go next with it though. Honestly I had no interest in seeing Rogue One and have no desire at all to watch the Han Solo movie. Also the prequels really sucked.

I'm a big Marvel fan and I think their characters and variety of stories and tones are much better (e.g. Winter Soldier vs Guardians of the Galaxy vs Ant-Man). I wouldn't say they're kiddie either, they have humour and I find them really funny (I'm 28 btw), and there's mature themes and dark moments in them at times too. Thor Ragnarok was the most fun I've had in the cinemas in a long time, amazing action, score and was hilarious!

So overall Marvel has 17 films that I love every single one of (some more than others) vs 4 Star Wars films I like but none of which really connected with me. So yeah I'd choose Infinity War easily.",0.9961,231

"I think they're worried about a similar climax or something. But I'm not worried. 
First of all, the Russo Brothers understand the character level conflict. Winter Soldier all came down to Cap having to face Bucky to get the chip in the Helicarrier. Civil War skipped the whole bad guy soldiers against the heroes, and made the conflict between between Cap and Iron Man. And they will certainly make the stakes very personal in Infinity War... which I will admit that Avengers 1 and 2 did not have personal stakes in the climax. Avengers 1 had a little bit with Tony choosing to risk himself to save the city. And Ultron had a fun interaction between Vision and Ultron... but it wasn't super personal. 
There has also been a progression of the Avengers ""cannon fodder"" ending. In 1, they just had to stop the mothership, and the hive-mind shut down. In 2, there was no central mind, so they had to kill every single ultron drone to kill ultron. And now, the army is not only NOT the climax, but it is only a small part of the threat. 
That alien army is an army of Outriders. Outriders are scouts. They have tactile telepathy and are sent to either kill or collect intel. My guess is that overkill of an army is actually only meant to read as many minds as possible to find out where in Wakanda the soul gem is hidden. Then the real threat will come.",-0.9925,278

"I thought it worked pretty well in X-Men: Apocalypse, and even to some extent in Age of Ultron (where Thor, Iron Man, and Vision focused their beams on Ultron Prime, then stopped for some reason). The best way for them to show how powerful the villain is, is to have him beat all the heroes at the same time. Not ""Loki can beat Hawkeye and Cap here, lose to Iron Man and Hulk there,"" or ""Ultron can be tackled by Cap, Iron Man, and Hulk individually without too much of an issue.""

Not saying there shouldn't be any cannon fodder at all, but at some point there should be some confrontation with the villain to show he doesn't need his army any more (especially here, once Thanos has multiple Infinity Stones).",-0.1406,155

It's not that cannon fodder has been used. It's that they use it and it's pointless because there are no stakes. I feel age of ultron was a rehash of the first avengers because of the Ultron army. It should have been all the avenger vs. Ultron like in the comics. Showing that it takes all the avengers to stop Ultron and showing his strength and giving a real reason on why they need to come together. Avengers beating up robots or cannon fodder with no stakes is exhausting. Civil war was nice because they added in stakes. Because everyone was fighting and it gave us the feeling of anyone could win or lose.. unlike avengers where we know captain America and ironman and Thor are not going to lose to an Ultron drone robot.,-0.0108,145

Also, Marvel *has* been doing some of the grittiest, dark adaptations on TV and nailing them. Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Punisher are unmatched in their category.

But this movie will kill off any kind of resemblance to comic accuracy and any chances to get a Spidey-Venom to and fro which is essentially the best part about the character. And they did all this AFTER the successful reception of Homecoming, which is the scariest part.

Now, maybe Fox aren't complete scum like Sony but with their track record, I would doubt it.

"Regarding cannon fodder, i *think* we may be safe.  

This is a info from the leaked D23 footage. for those who only watch official materials. WARNING DONE:  after d23/comic con, a couple sites posted an interview with the Russos, and a question was about the insane stuff in the D23 IW footage. ie. the moon scene (which in actual fact, appears to be Thanos ripping apart pieces from some type of spatial body and throwing them like a meteor shower). The question was how can they top that and why would they show such a climactic scene in the first footage. Russos basically said, the stuff they showed is NOT the most insane stuff in the film and none of that stuff is Act 3 stuff (or something to that effect).  The footage also showed parts of that war with the Outriders (I think that's their name - the multi armed alien cannon fodder).  

So if we trust what they are saying, i think the invasion of Wakanda could be late mid Act 2.  

Russo's also said: 
‚ÄúThe current cut is over 2 ¬Ω, yes. Most of it is a movie you can show.  Still a lot of work left to be done‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs certainly going to be a film that lives in the two and a half, two and a half plus range.‚Äù

Sorry, i can't find the interview again, talking about the footage and the acts, etc. Been trying :( 

Also, as someone who watched the leaked footage, there are some interesting things.

- he has only 2 stones when he pulls down the meteor shower (space/power)
- the backgrounds match up with the scenery where spiderman is being driven into the ground, tony start is being punched, the scenes you may have heard where doctor strange is interacting with Star Lord, etc
- many think that planet is Xandar and its in ruins 
- from the official trailer, we see Thanos adding the space stone to the guantlet.  This background also appears to be the same ruined landscape that people believe could be Xandar.   If this is not a fake out (ie. change colours of stones to hide the story steps), it would appear alot of that must be earlier on in the film.  I cant imagine he would have 2 stones, then in the last 10 minutes....oh here are the next 4.  

Did people notice how Civil War, kinda... just started?  almost like an assumption that you have seen some of the earlier movies.  No character intros, no character names, nothing. It just kinda went.  For better or worse, i think IW will be the same way. the story will just start to save time.  The only 'intros' of sorts with be Thanos and his Black Order to fully flesh them out a bit more in Act 1.",-0.9149,550

"The idea that ""cannon fodder characters"" are good and necessary, no matter how often this formula is repeated is questionable.  John names a lot of movies that have used this device and that's fine, but lots of these movies were one-offs, and they were ABOUT those two sides fighting.  Avengers Infinity war is about Thanos.  Using the cannon fodder approach three times in a row in essentially EVERY AVENGERS MOVIE is too much.  Variance is important and the idea that the same formula used over and over in back to back movies is always a good thing is silly.  When it comes to the arts, creativity and innovation in any arena is essential, and film is no exception.

Civil War was 100% personal stakes from Cap having to fight one friend to defend the other, and Panther having to choose not to kill his father's murderer.

"With regard to Taylor Pechter's comment about the use of cannon fodder -- I think he was referring to the consistent use of cannon fodder in the final, climactic battles in the past Avengers films, and how it would be tiresome for the same template to be used in Infinity War. Sure, the use of cannon fodder is common for many movies, but for the third Avengers movie to use it just as the previous two had is too formulaic at this point. I would love to see the Avengers and company have 10 on 1 face offs against Thanos, similar to that fight with the Turtles and Shredder in the first Michael Bay TMNT film - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhGPPWayeqk",0.2023,126

"You are correct in that it's the nature of the movie that tells what kind of enemy you need. A movie with several heroes will need cannon fodder, you can't have 20 heroes waiting around to get their shot at attacking the one bad guy. A movie with one or two can be fine with a single baddie. Pretty much all the movies either have a balance of both or lean more towards one or the other. Dr. Strange has one or two. Avengers have a central bad guy and cannon fodder. And tons of movies do this. People only notice it in Marvel because they have so many team up movies coming out in a row.",-0.2944,127

"You have basically all of the heroes in the MCU facing off against Thanos in this movie. That is a too many people trying to dog pile one actor, it would look silly.  Even in X-men, and AoU, you only have 2-3 heroes facing off the villain at a time, the others are fighting other things or are knocked out. The scene of Thor, Iron Man, and Vision only lasted for a few seconds. You want to be able to have a long scene that you can see all the heroes showcasing their abilities. You can either do that like in civil war: have two small groups with equal importance and stature face off against each other, or you have to have cannon fodder. And it's been a tool that writers and movies have used for centuries. It will continuing to be used as well. And it is NOT a bad thing. You can showcase a villain's strength and have cannon fodder, they are not mutually exclusive. You can have big battle showcases and also have them challenge the big bad in small groups. To show a villain's threat, don't simply show power, show his actual nature. Show how cruel Thanos is, how chilling, how merciless, THAT will go a long way from simply showing constant power clashes.",-0.6564,245

"by all means i think you should play battlefront 2 and enjoy it. But by no means should you go out of your way to promote it or do any sponsorship deals, something like that will only bring you unwanted grief. People are sick of all the microtransactions in gaming and whether it is deserved or not, Battlefront 2 has become the poster child for it. 

I assure you that any gaming fanatic is every bit as derisive as a movie fanatic, but what makes it worse is that they're pretty justified this time around. Make no mistake, EA deserves to lose 3 billion dollars over this. Microtransactions are getting way out of hand in the AAA gaming industry, but if you think you'll have fun you should play.

If you love star wars you should definitely check it out, there are definitely parts of it that are amazing. The controversy around loot boxes etc, is definitely worth discussing, but there are plenty of people championing those causes.

what i'm worried about that - if we assume the war in wakanda is for the soul stone, the above example would imply the cannon fodder battle is again, act 3. hehe  I'd prefer if the huge battle is end act 1 and into act 2. Then maybe Black Dwarf (known as Cull Obsidian in this film) shows up and the fight becomes all of those heroes vs Cull (who is apparently near hulk levels of power).  

I dont have a clue what to expect in act 3. If it truly is insane and the meteor shower is nothing yet, i'm hoping for something like the city bending of Doctor Strange WITH thanos fighting them during that.  Even Doctor Strange plumetting with Thanos through all those strange dimensions? something like that along with the other characters and Thanos can even kick the crap out of 1 of them and they come out of the fall and end up in some other dimension, where that character dies.

My biggest worry is actually pretty silly.  Thanos is not supposed to be a bruiser.  He has crazy energy projection and powerful magical type abilities.  Of course, movie characters are never as powerful as the comics show them, but i hope thanos, even without the gauntlet, can fire energy beams from his eyes (like superman does) or his arms, etc and do some other stuff as well and not just walk up to people and punch them..",-0.0966,302
