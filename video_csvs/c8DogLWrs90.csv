It's a good idea but not with all those stuff.
For example:

-Better go and get those ten kilos of ""survival"" kits.
When there is an earthquake you  run so quickly to go outside cause you're scared and in that moment you can't think about the survival kits. Sorry but you, Buzzfeed are so unrealistic.
