She may not have the strongest and consistent voice, but she has a knack for a bomb ass hook that would transition the ladies voices to their fullest potential without the discrepancies. Overall, a nice song, but very late in grabbing your attention, doesn't pickups until Tiny leading to the ending.",-0.5504,87

"I love xscape but, I feel like tocha over sings all of them. She acts like they're her background singers. My opinion, be it right or wrong its mine, but tocha wants to be a solo artist. But she probably knows she want get far without the other ladies. She said herself that she's the voice of the group. I think that's wrong and it makes her seem like she's better than them with that comment.",0.81,85

"I use to like Kandi  and  I can understand how she feels for all what those sisters put her through and she is more successful then they are, but God forgives us maybe that is what Kandi needs to do.  The group will not be the same without her.  Xcape is going to do great without her, but old fans like me want the real deal.  Seems to me Kandi has turned into a mean girl and I don't like that.  Sometimes I feels she brags to much about her accomplishments, being proud is good, but everyday bragging is not so much good.  Tiny is wonderful, do your thang girl.",0.9912,121

"Kandi had to fulfill her previous engagements that was signed up before this reunion. Broadway being one of them (which is where she is at now). She couldn't break those contracts. Therefore, she and the rest of the ladies agreed that she finish those and then return. They're doing a part 2 of the tour as well. She's coming back, she didn't leave. She just won't be on this EP right now. It's just business, nothing personal. Stop blaming the rest of the group. ""It wasn't successful without Kandi before."" Yeah, well that was a different era, circumstance, and situation, for Xscape. It's not that way now. And y'all are just going have deal with the 3 T's of the group for right now.",0.8178,148
Kandi is a Dream Killa,0.25,5
Kandi is still in the group. They said on a radio interview that Kandi couldn’t be there to record the song because she still have other obligations outside of Xscape to deal with it. This is a great song though....relatable! And the vocals at the end are Tamika Scott’s vocals not Tinys,0.6588,61
