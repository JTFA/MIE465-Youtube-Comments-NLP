2-3 years ago when I revisited my love for Fleetwood Mac...had been busy raising children...i literally could not stop playing their music....at one point my husband said can you give it a rest for like a day.... (no)....i said to him you know I always loved their songs and their music but it's on a whole other level now...im listening to the absolute beauty of the sounds I hear each time I play it....then I said Lindsey Buckingham is a genious....my husband was like there's alot of good songs from that era....i said I know....but these songs are crafted to perfection....what a gift this band has been. And so glad Mick called Lindsey back in the day to join. If Mick never heard Buckingham/Nicks music that day we would have never experienced  this amazing beautiful band.,0.9935,164

"I thought this video was interesting at first and tried to overlook the Kanye reference, but after watching your other videos.. It all just sounds like a bunch of ""smart"" sounding nonsense. How can you mention the Beatles and Kanye in the same breath? Ugh.. I looked through your channel for a video breaking down all of Kanye's studio offerings and didn't find squat. I'd like to see what new recording techniques Kanye has innovated or a sample of his lyrical offerings. I doubt there's much of either one. I guess I would have a better opinion of him if I'd just took his word for it. The real innovators don't go around telling everyone how great they are. As far as I'm concerned he's just a popular culture leech, it's no wonder he's married to a kardashian. I'd rather listen to an hour of Weesay's O! chips or Brushy One String's Chicken in The Corn and feel infinitely more content than ANYTHING Kanye has to offer. He's nothing but a happy meal artist with an artistic honesty the likes of new country.",0.9534,200

This was a fairly regular occurrence. The sun sets early at that latitude, and so on the ride back to the house with a picturesque sunset stretched across the horizon my mom would pop in Rumours on the cassette player and we would sit silently staring out at the desert in the twilight listening to every song on that album.

I remember my friend in 1994 strongly suggested Fleetwood Mac, i remember he wrote down on the piece of paper. He mentioned all the song one by one is listenable i no need to fast forward, that good the album is he said..!  Later i bought the cassette I push my self to listen because i knew i should give at least 7 try to the band, singer to get use to tune right?... I can't believe about this video as well.

"Nice video...but FYI, I have very little respect for any blogger or maker of videos who hides behind the labelling (I am British and hence use British orthography= ""labeling"") expression ""nerdwriter."" You Yanks are far too unoriginal and uncreative, forever whining about having an interest in those intellectual and artistic pursuits which have helped to fashion European civilisation. You obnoxiously limit yourselves to the preconceived and prejudicial opinions of the herd in referring to yourselves as any of the following: ""nerd,"" ""geek,"" "" dweeb,"" ""dork,"" etc.  In other words, your appelation/moniker/epithet ""nerdwriter"" is thoroughly tasteless and smacks (pun intended) of the more negative, peculiarly American propensity for stereotyping.  In universities of the UK we snarlingly mock you for so doing, for such self-deprecatory self-martyrdom..something we call the ""California effect.""  Simply put, our Oxbridge system will ever eclipse your American ""nerd"" culture, which is as laughable as your mock attempt at humour in that utterly risible and pathetic tele series of yours, ""Big Bang Theory,"" which celebrates all the negative Americanisms enumerated above.  Simply put, Yank, not a few of our ""jocks"" took their A-levels, went up to Oxford or down to Cambridge, can read and enjoy Plato in the Attic Greek...and NOT one of them is either called or refers to themselves as a ""nerd.""  Tell me, what are you sad about as you seem to be projecting something perhaps rather transparent on to Lindsey Buckingham...Interestingly, you refer to this musical Adonis' guitar as ""whining""-yet another example of psychological projection, for you do seem rather ""whiny"" yourself.
