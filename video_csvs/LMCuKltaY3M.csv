"It‚Äôs a sad indictment of the continued dumbing down of those within media and marketing, were that possible, when a key character of an advert is so blatantly copied from Chris Riddell‚Äôs 1986 childrens‚Äô book. Compounded by likely being sufficiently uninformed to realise Elbow‚Äôs copy isn‚Äôt the great original; it all seems to say that John Lewis themselves are in the second-hand market. I don‚Äôt know whether to blame their marketing people or their advertising company, although investing further energy doing either would be pointless whilst they reside in their land of the blind where the one-eyed man is king.",-0.0516,118
