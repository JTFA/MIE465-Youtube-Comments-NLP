"Councilman:  “Next speaker.  Yes sir, identify yourself.” 

Bro 1: “what up council, my name is Chad Kroger, um, I’m an activist and house party enthusiast.  Over the past week I have been in a state of deep despair upon hearing the news that LA is trying to outlaw house parties in the Hollywood Hills.  I am here, determined, to stop this future atroxity.  House parties were the bedrock of my development as a young man in San Clemente.  My first introduction to manhood came when the captain of my water polo team, Boomer Kingsley, asked me to shotgun a tall can of Bud Light in front of the whole squad at his end-of-the-season bash.  His parents were in Tahoe at the time so we tore that weekend up.  It was epic.  And I was super stoked.  My newfound confidence gave me the courage to ask out the most popular girl in school, Lauren Stockholder, to prom that year.  She rejected me, and I had to go with Stacey McMillan, but I didn’t care because I was so amped on chugging with my boys.  That’s what house parties do.  Raging at house parties is the truest way—“

Councilman:  “THANK YOU. NEXT” 

Councilman:  “Next speaker please come and identify yourself.” 

Bro 2: “what up council, my name is JT Par, I am also here to defend parties in the Hollywood Hills.  I grew up like most kids- worried I couldn’t bench two plates, that I wouldn’t fit in, that I wouldn’t find love.  Then I discovered partying and suddenly all those worries went to the wayside.  I didn’t need love.  I had keg stands.  I discovered I was great at raging and it revealed wonderful things about myself; I could relate to bros regardless of what kind of bro they were.  I could be at a party and moon people and everyone would laugh- you know- be witty.  Or.  I could play beer pong and compete with real integrity.  In short, I fulfilled my potential.  If you outlaw house parties, you may keep the volume down, but an externality is that you might keep people from bonding. America needs bonding.  People need to put aside their differences and find common joy.  There’s no more effective environment for that than a freakin’ rager.  This is best exemplified in me and Chad’s relationship.

This is to combat the issue in LA of people airbnb'ing out their houses specifically for house parties for thousands of dollars a night multiple nights a week while being a gigantic nuisance to the community. A person making thousands every night they throw a party isn't going to give a fuck about a $100 fine every night, but if that fine escalates eventually to over $8000?
