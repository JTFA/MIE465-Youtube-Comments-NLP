(Guns get banned) i bought a gun of the darkweb because criminals are going to make or have or sell guns any way and its just a matter of if your going to be able to defend yourself with your own gun that day... they didnâ€™t even ask for my name it was so easy came in the mail 3 days later... first time buying and shooting... im so lucky that no one had a gun because now i can just shoot everyone without chance of anyone getting to defend themselfs,-0.7933,98
