"MRI scanners use magnets to cause hydrogen atoms in tissue to give off radio waves. The scanner then uses the radio waves to form an image of said tissue.

Radio waves are non-ionising which means they are too big (they range in size from 1mm - 100km) and too low powered to fit in between the molecules that make up DNA and do damage.
If they did everything on Earth would have been long dead from every type of cancer since radio, TV, Wifi, Bluetooth, satellite, cell reception etc all uses radio waves or microwaves (also non-ionising) to transmit signals.
Plus stars literally emit radio waves which reach the surface of Earth, this is how radio telescopes work. If radio waves were harmful to DNA, life would've never developed.",-0.9081,146
