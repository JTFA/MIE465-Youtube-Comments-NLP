"Drink More Pepsi me sir as I said, ""I do not support this, this disappoints me because you see black people, Native Americans (Mexicans), and other people living in poverty with no money some even homeless and you are here rescuing a source of food that isn't going to help you in life. This is bullshit no one ever gives the homeless home's because you guys are all selfish motherfuckers who care about dogs. Please delete your channel because i do not like seeing this, this what pisses me off the most. You see soldiers who were in the army for 4 years and are homeless.
