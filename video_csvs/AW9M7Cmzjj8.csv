Yes, like in everycountry we have or unhealthy food, but the real traditional food was createdin the prehispanic era, where eeryone almost didnt eat meat, thats means that almost all our really traditional food is almost pure vegetables, so dont talk shit next time when you have never tried real mexican food.",0.9492,192
