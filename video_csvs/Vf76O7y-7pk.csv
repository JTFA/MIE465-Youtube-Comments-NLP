"After all this time after all these seasons
After your one decision to go to the water for reason
Now it's only the ocean and you
And all these lines will all be erased soon
They go out with the tide
Then come back with the waves
It's only the ocean and you
You don't want you don't wait
You don't love but you don't hate
You just roll over me and you pull me in
When this work is done and this coat is dry
When this world is too much, it will be
Only the ocean and me
When these sails go up, mountains fade away
Stars come out, I'm finally free
It's only the ocean and me
You don't want, you don't wait
You don't love, but you don't hate
You just roll over me and you pull me in
And you pull me in
You don't want, you don't wait
You don't love, but you don't hate
You just roll over me and you pull me in
And you pull me in
You just roll over me and you pull me in!",0.6876,194
