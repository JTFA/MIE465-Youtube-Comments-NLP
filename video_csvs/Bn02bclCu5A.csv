"On Tuesday I spoke at length with Rotten Tomatoes spokesperson Dana Benson regarding the movie ratings site's Audience Score of 55% for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I was curious to know whether there was any merit to conspiracy theories that have circulated in recent days alleging organized vote campaigns to drive down the film‚Äôs scores from their ‚Äúproper‚Äù levels, and why there is such a big disparity between the mediocre Rotten Tomatoes audience ratings and other, higher critics' and viewers' responses, such as the ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating from Cinemascore.

Benson, who is the Vice President of Communications at Fandango, the parent company of Rotten Tomatoes, told me that Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes are fully confident in the ratings and scores for the Star Wars picture. She assured me that Rotten Tomatoes has gone to great lengths to verify their ratings' accuracy and authenticity.

‚ÄúWe have several teams of security, network, and social database experts who constantly monitor reviews and ratings to ensure that they are genuine,‚Äù Benson said. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt seen anything unusual with The Last Jedi, except that there has been an uptick in the number of written user reviews submitted. Aside from that, everything is normal and we don‚Äôt see any unusual activity. We looked at The Last Jedi compared to other blockbusters and it has been consistent with those past films.‚Äù


For such a rare event picture like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the increased level of interest and participation in review sites is to be expected. Benson told me that the picture has received a ‚Äúcomparable number of reviews to The Force Awakens.""

Some critics and social media commenters have questioned the gap between the Rotten Tomatoes score and the ratings on other services, highlighting it as proof that there is something amiss with the Rotten Tomatoes numbers. But I‚Äôve seen absolutely no evidence presented by anyone to back up these claims, nor even a credible explanation as to where this supposed legion of organized Star Wars haters is and what its motives might be for depressing the film‚Äôs ratings.  The simpler and far more credible explanation is simply that a lot of people don‚Äôt like the movie.

One widely circulated story about an anonymous individual who runs the Facebook page ‚ÄúDown With Disney‚Äôs Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys‚Äù claims that this person created bots to manipulate the Rotten Tomatoes score. But Benson and other company reps I spoke to dismissed such claims as nonsense. Although anyone can post whatever they want on the site in the effort to drive ratings either up or down, Rotten Tomatoes has nearly two decades experience at identifying and controlling for such efforts to push the scores in one direction or another.

I pressed Ms. Benson for her hypothesis, but she chose not to offer a theory as to why the gap between Rotten Tomatoes‚Äô critics' reviews and those of fans now stands at 38 percentage points, 93% to 55%.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain why there‚Äôs such a disparity,‚Äù Benson told me. ‚ÄúHow we take this is that people are super passionate about this movie. On the positive side, our site is popular, and it has become an important platform for debate and discussion.‚Äù

Pacific Bridge research
'Star Wars' franchise results on RottenTomatoes.com

Benson noted that Rotten Tomatoes isn‚Äôt the only social media platform with such mixed reactions to The Last Jedi, and added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working around the clock to get the numbers right. Authenticity is very important to us. We have security teams, network teams, database teams who work so hard, it‚Äôs a little disheartening for them to see people make such [accusatory] claims without knowing the facts.

However fans may feel about The Last Jedi, it's clear that audience rating hasn't had a discernible impact at the box office, at least not yet. The Rian Johnson-directed film enjoyed the second biggest movie debut ever in North America, with a $220 million total through Sunday, and it collected another $231 million overseas.

If Disney can do these tricks in other new movies that are considered suspense-thriller  or sci-fi,  its ok , but to do these things  in an iconic franchise that has a long history of good story lines and characters and has a strong fan based, its a disaster.

"This is another reason why last Jedi is shit 

Like, don‚Äôt like force awakens the good thing about that movie is it had a lot of set up that left you excited for the next film everyone was pumped for last Jedi because of all the things left unanswered in force awakens 

Last Jedi just shat all over that stuff, dismissed, ignored or played down all those story threads leaving force awakens as almost irrelevant in its trilogy 

But here‚Äôs my point what is there to be excited about episode 9 

Seriously what the fuck is there to be excited for in episode 9 what are you anticipating will happen or be explored in episode 9

Nothing there is literally no buzz about it anywhere what direction the story could take how things could be resolved nothing 

Last Jedi not only killed off the last Jedi Luke it killed of this trilogy and any hope for franchise in the future and I seriously have great reservations about this Han fucking solo piece of shit movie nobody wants to see now

wishes right? so cast another good strong actor to play leia in 9... if she¬¥s for it why are people fighting it? i don¬¥t understand... kinda bothers me
that fans would go against her... i¬¥ve heard a few sugestions but i still think judi dench feels like leia maby a strict strong look? i don¬¥t know, just a feeling. 
also the young actor who played her in rogue one looks like her a bit i think, thinking of potential prequels. r.i.p. carrie.
