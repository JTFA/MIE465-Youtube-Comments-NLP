"*SPOILERS I agree that this episode was definitely one of the weaker ones. The twists were quite obvious and it really didn't make you question the ethics of the technology or characters involved. The technology was just outright wrong and immoral + the decisions made by the mother were again just wrong. However the writing was still very strong - there was no grandma or husband to be seen, did the mother act so recklessly and defensively based on the fact that she lacked a mother figure growing up and because she was terrified of losing her daughter after the husband left. The acting as usual was also really strong and the characters were quite believable in their performance but the ending felt like violent overkill imo.",-0.7869,134

"As weird as it sounds, yes (although I believe that the dude and the girl were at the beginning stage already when they had sex). I for one, blame the mom. If she had just not restricted everything from her child, then maybe she'd grew up different. Restricting her from all the dark stuff, ironically made Sarah more interested in these kinds of stuff. This also applies in today's society. Notice how the most well groomed kids, the smartest, the most talented, the ones you think that are so perfect and has everything, are the ones that end up smoking weed and doing bad things.  Control is great, but too much control can mess up a child's brain.",0.7186,136

Yea that situation could have been handled better but the mom is the one at fault. No one should have that kind of power and insight over anyone's personal life. She brought that outcome on herself.,-0.6597,39
Yeah i felt the same way it was the most predictable black mirror episode and it had unoriginal themes,0.296,19
"Yeeeee suuuure as kids we saw such videos and, we all had cocaine drug dealer friends at the age of 15...and ofc she gets pregnant like all the bad things happend in one fucking episode. Come on... ok its just a serial but seriously make it more realistic looking atleast like a bit of normal poeples's life using this controlling system.",0.5187,67

"Yo there is no way the chick who played Sara the 3rd time was 15, I legit thought ‘Okay she’s about 22 here’

How can they cast that tall lanky woman to play a 15 year old girl? Thats the most unbelievable thing this show has ever done.",0.5709,55

"holy fucking shit. I just finished watching this episode, and in my opinion is one of the strongest eps that Black Mirror ever made. Definitely, after you watch this you will question a lot of things to yourself.",0.1796,43
howtobequeen The mother is the one responsible for all of that. she put her daughter in that situation in the first place. if she has never used that technology the girl wouldn't have those bad desires. she made her become curious about bad things in life. Therefore its not her mistake.,0.8843,56

"i know the ending is supposed to be depressing, but I was kinda rooting for Sarah in here tbh and I never felt any pity for the mom. I feel like she deserved it. Overall I find the episode okay. It was a bit slow at the beginning, the build-up wasn't really that enthralling, and the ending was kinda meh, but I loved hating the mom so that's that. 

compared to the rest of the whole series, I feel like this would be above Be Right Back , which is ranked as my least favorite episode.",0.7688,106
