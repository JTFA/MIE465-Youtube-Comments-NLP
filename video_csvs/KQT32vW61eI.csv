Habla de como el amor y la naturaleza de sentirlo pasa por encima de todo, sin importar nada, y como algunos lo desprecian y desaprovechan, no solo conmueven los personajes y lo que vemos en primer plano, conmueve la idea de que las películas son espejos de la realidad, y que las oportunidades de vivir son fugaces.

How much sorrow can I take?
