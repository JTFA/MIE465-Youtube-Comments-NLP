"The brush packing honestly looks like it’s one of those fake KJ packages ppl try to sell. Also, considering she has used real animal hair for the brushes, why has she felt the need to use fake leather on the packaging. If you are using real animal hair, you might as well use real leather. Or vice verse (synthetic hair with a fake leather) and another point, if you are a MUA and you have spent all your money on a brush set, you cannot use them on a vegan/vegetarian client, so as you have spent all your money on this set, you can’t exactly afford another brush set for those vegan clients",-0.4019,131
