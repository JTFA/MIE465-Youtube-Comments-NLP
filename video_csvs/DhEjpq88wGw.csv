Normani has  the same drive and determination as Beyonce and nobody in the group compares t Beyoncé vocally Dinah has A LOT of issues to work on as well as Normani so do your research first.,0.4975,100
Isaiah Guzman LOL At thinking Dinah  is the Beyonce,0.5473,9
Isaiah Guzman huh your obviously a little slow like a dumb mental person if you believe that shit. Dinah is like a Mariah Carey rihanna and Leona Lewis. Y'all delusional d Stan's some how believe Dinah looks like bey. No offense but Bey is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to beautiful and talented to be compared to Dinah. Normani is like a Beyonce and Solange and Mariah Carey but only for her whistle notes. Try again bby girl. Normani is the hardest worker in the group and one of the hardest workers in the music industry. She is very serious about her work and solo career.

Where’s the full performance? Same with Lauren.,0.0,11
"Why are there so many stupid people!  There are some complaining about Normani stepping over the “Michelle” and that Normani was, therefore, shading the real Michelle.  Why don’t these stupid children realise that none of these artists do their choreography - the show has their own choreography team who are putting this and other battles together - Normani is just acting  out Beyoncé, it’s not real.  I hope when Normani finally leaves this group she will also leave some of these immature comments behind.  But I very much doubt it because, although they are hating, we all know that deep down they have a strong admiration for Normani and her talents, hence why they can’t keep off her social media, she is their drug - the addiction is very strong, I suppose I should really show them more pity the poor dears, they can’t help it!",-0.801,170

"Yeah but you have to be a little less harsh about the regurgitation of the Dinah is Beyonce comments, a lot of the fans are still very young sheeps still - if both Beyoncé and Dinah were to strip down to their natural self these same young fools would insist on getting their eye vision checked.  To me Dinah looks more like Kerri Hilson with no resemblance to Beyoncé whatsoever",-0.0138,72

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
