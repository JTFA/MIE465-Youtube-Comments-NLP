"God is a gentleman, yet once you open your heart to him, he will recklessly open your eyes and ears. God is good! God is sovereign, he knows everything and he longs for you! Don’t ever turn away from God. Things may come into your life and you may get angry, maybe even angry at God, but ask him to forgive you, because God will NEVER do anything to wrong you! 

I pray for anyone reading this. That your life be filled with the love of the Father. That you will have dramatic changes in your life! I pray that the Lord will Open your Heart and that the Spirit will move so greatly in you that you will be a Light in the world of darkness. In the name of the Father, son and Holy Spirit, in Jesus name i pray. And all God’s people said : Amen.

My question is to those who are against this song what is your definition of proper caution? And to those who may argue the importance of this i say read the definition. And to argue the part of the definition which states careless of consequences is not valid either. Can you recklessly do one thing but be sound in another? Heck yeah you sure can!!!
