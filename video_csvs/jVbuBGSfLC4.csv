I have never liked drilling out the waste wood because it makes the chisel feel so swequard and in my view it doesn‚Äôt really save that much time. That said holes one inch and up really do benefit from drilling out the waste so if I‚Äôm timber framing I would probably use a auger bit because it works well for this. This is just my preference.,0.2357,73

I watched the series you posted 5 years ago where you were outdoors building a bench.  From those videos I built a similar but larger bench made from house framing fir and clear pine (on the facing edges of the apron and legs).  Wonderful stuff.  Have a good Christmas.,0.9231,55
"I wonder if the critics have ever seen a guy like Paul chop a mortise for speed? It goes much much much faster than this. And anyone who is inexperienced in chopping mortises follows along and builds a bench with this series will see this, they'll see an improvement in quality and speed from one leg to the next. I can't speak for Paul but it seems he was working at a slower pace that an inexperienced person would use. Once you understand where the pitfalls lie and how to handle them the process speeds up quite a bit.
With that said, this isn't about production line speed. You will eventually find a pace that will allow you to work accurately yet not so slow as to make the process feel like drudgery. 
 I would like to see Paul do a video showing the pitfalls that he glossed over in this video like when the chisel wants to twist as you hit it, as well as the knot. Sometimes inexperienced persons will just keep driving the chisel down as it twists without resetting and correcting at the onset. As far as the knot, most guys will avoid that area for a mortise at any cost, even if the work will look best and function best with the mortise at that exact spot. 

I'm just sorry that Paul said fettle, every time guys like Paul use these words the elitists cling to it for re-enforcement. Then they go and post videos of fettling their harbor freight plane, then they fettle their Irwin chisels and post a video of how inferior these chisels are to quality chisels(even though they have never even touched a quality chisel). They hate the fact they need to sharpen the Irwin right out of the package.... The true difference is Two Cherries actually insist they be sharpened before use...",0.9726,336

"Matt Hood Thanks Matt. However, I am disabled. I have chronic pain, near blind, and shaking hands, so everything pretty much takes me 3-5 times longer due to having to be much more careful with placements and mallet blows. I manage to get my chisel ""sticky"" sharp. Meaning they stick into what ever they slightly touch. So, I have to wrap bandaids all the time with my shakes. I have survived a stroke and came back most if the way from completely losing my entire right side. Still have almost no feeling in much if my right side other than pain. Soft touches don't register, so I have to take things slow in self preservation mode. However, I refuse to just sit in the couch and am in the middle of my forth year of college to gay back to work at something I can do.

"No sir, for one mortise. There are two in each leg. For those of us with limited funding and even more limited tooling, this is reasurring that we can do it too. May take a bit longer than a machine that can chop it our for you, but you get the experience and satisfaction that YOU did the work, not some machine. I doubt that with my limited experience I could chop that mortise in 5 times as much time. Likely 3-4 hours per notice, until I build experience. Then maybe quicker. But still doubt if I'll ever get a six by 3/4 or six by one inch m ortise in half an hour.",0.652,127

"Paul, I want to truly thank you for all the  time, effort, and pure craftsmanship you put into your work. Your care for all aspects of your projects amazes and inspires me. You are are true teacher and an absolute master woodworker. you exude so much care and teaching in everything you do, that even your small comments and conversations are incredibly helpful. I am so very thankful to have found your videos and be able to learn from a master. 

To those that are complaining about the length, either you're trolling, new to Paul's videos, or just being rude. Paul is one of the absolute best woodworkers alive, and he's an excellent teacher. I've learned much from watching how he works, how he handles problems, and learned much about the thought process of a master craftsman through all the little details, and small comments he makes while he works. If you're already an ""expert"", this probably isn't for you, but if you're still learning like I am, his wisdom and experience from 50 years of craftsmanship is an invaluable resource. 

Instead of being an ass to someone who has spent thousands of hours and incredible effort to produce quality, educational content; either fast forward, play the video at high speed, or move on to another video that's more your style. 20 years ago, MANY amateur and professional woodworkers would have paid hundreds to thousands of dollars to be able to learn from experts like Paul. Now, Paul and hundreds like him are teaching anyone in the world who is willing to learn. He's uploaded over 180 distinct videos of him sharing his wisdom and advice with others. Maybe a little more gratitude and humility are in order.",0.9916,324

Cheap tools can work too, may have to sharpen a bit more often, but if you maintain them then you still get great cuts for 1/20th the price.

I now can do a mortise faster with your technique than I can with the machine, taking into account the laborious setup and test pieces.
