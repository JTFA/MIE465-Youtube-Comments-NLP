"R I P  Mr. Jim Nabors   a sweet kind person.  Met him at charity events to which he donated.  He was just like Gomer, just sweet shy humble and most gracious to his many fans.  Then when he sung with his God given gift of voice  he could raise the roof and give one the chills with his deep rich powerful voice.
Now Mr. Nabors is in Heaven singing with the Angels and leading the choir.
In the choir of Angels are Aunt Bee and Thelma Lou and Floyd the Barber and Otis and Howard and of course  Andy and Barney :(   :(",0.9764,111
