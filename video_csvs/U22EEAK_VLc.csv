Once it has been steamed (and/or flavor-infused), simply pour it in the bowl, take a rubber spatula and start stirring.  Add more chocolate, if you desire.

Peanut butter and Rice  Krispies- add rice krispies to melted chocolate pour onto cookie sheet swirl in peanut butter, tap to thin and pop in freezer. 

My personal favorite- white chocolate and candied cherries and fruit same method.

"Start with simple foods like carrots and potatoes (like Aries G said, boil with a little water until soft and pur√©e), see how your baby likes it and then slowly start incorporating other things like veggies (broccoli, sweet potato, pumpkin, etc.) and meat (chicken, salmon, etc.). With veggie pur√©es mix in a teaspoon of vegetable oil just before serving it. Fruit pur√©es are a good thing for in between (apple, banana - no need to cook banana, mango, pear, etc.) and if you mix in some sort of grain like instant oats it keeps baby satisfied for longer. With every food see how baby reacts to it and keep an eye out for possible allergies - if unsure consult with a pediatrician :) I wouldn't incorporate nuts in baby food until your baby's older though, in Germany they don't recommend it before three years of age, but again the pediatrician will be able to help you out!",0.9147,185
