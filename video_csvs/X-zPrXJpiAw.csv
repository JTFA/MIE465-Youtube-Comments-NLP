"Except you completely ignore economies of scale.

First, is it ever actually stated that it's *not* procedurally generated?

Second, even if the world itself isn't procedurally generated, things like buildings, plants, etc can be and are in game worlds that are 'manually' built.

Create asset packs for 20 different cultures, and 20 different terrains, and you have *more* than enough to fill that world. That's not even close to an equivalent of 10 Witcher 3's.

Assets for things like terrain, buildings, furniture and plants are easy and cheap to make. The expensive art is human characters (build a good custom character system and use that for all of your NPC's... Job done), and animals/monsters. Wouldn't require anywhere near 10x the work of building The Witcher 3, even with a far larger variety; even among creatures, stuff can be easily reused. Then there's intricate things like weapons etc, but procedural systems make that pretty achievable too.

'Unique floors' are easy, and do not at all mean that you couldn't reuse assets across them. Can you name 100 different terrains? Can you name 100 distinct architectural styles? 100 distinct styles of clothing that would make sense in the world of Aincrad? 100 entirely different sets of monsters to populate each floor?

It's more like 'this floor is entirely underground and has no civilization, and this one is mostly ocean, with islands covered in deciduous trees, and architecture that looks like England'.

That underground one can be done entirely using assets from a mountainous floor, and the island one is water, which would be reused everywhere, sand, which is reused between deserts and beaches, grass, which you only need a few variations of, mud, and deciduous plants which would be reused all over the place. Then building stuff for that culture, which is similar to many other seemingly distinct cultures, and could be reused on a floor with a totally different biome and climate and still be called 'unique'.

And even different terrains allow for reuse of assets. Like five types of mud, five types of rock, and two types of sand could account for *all* of the nature ground in the entire game world.

Ten types of brick (reusing the terrain rock for five of these, and one of the dirt ones for mud brick), ten types of wood, clay, glass, a few types of plaster, a few types of cement, a few types of concrete, and ten types of metal could account for all of the buildings.

Estimating development costs for something like this is utterly impossible until we have stuff that is much, much closer to it.",0.9779,520

"IBM have already started working on the project in partnership with another company whose name I can't recall. The demo they showed was actually powered by Watson and they had almost the entire first floor done. Also, keep in mind that the light novel are not extremely detailed on the art and all of each independent floor, except for a few that are mentioned as kirito ventured in it. It is without a doubt a huge undertaking, however, any studio that take on the project will reuse assets. For example, floral asset can mostly be reused except for a few climat specific floors ( and god know there are not 100 different climates). Also, dungeons can and should be system generated using a clever algorithm which will save time and money. ( only event special dungeons should be manually created for a true feeling of uniqueness). Furthermore, the huge landmasses can be autofilled by the system with the exception of towns and notable landmarks from within the game. This brings the scale of the work down to something more on Par with Witcher 3 and GTA V world,  in terms of textures probably more due to 100 different floors and 99 dungeons.  However, let say that game costs 800M to make. Lets take the biggest MMORPG as comparision. In 2015 WoW had a peak of 5.67M subsribers. So for consistency lets say 5M. Imagine a retail price of $60.0. Just in sales that represents 300M income. Now WoW is also subscription based. Taking the 5M player base lets cut it down to 4M assuming it loss more members each year than it gained. Subscription being $15 or $180 per member that gives us 720M income within 1 year if it sells 5M copy and retains 4M subscribers. the subscription alone will pay back the games dev cost in a bit more than one year. MMORPGS can last ages. WoW has been ongoing since 2004. Not to mention the game would be a first and unique experience it would not be suprising to see the game sell over 10M copies if a montly subscription is used such as in WoW or Final Fantasy. Now the obvious path would be to develop the game in a similar fashion as Elder Scrolls Online. Release the first 15 floors at launch and add another 10 - 15 floors every year and release them as DLC updates like WoW or Morrowind. This is the more realistic approach. It seems like now a lot, but imagine how many hours of content could be in 15 floors the size of GTA V. If it is done well they could just progressively develop it like ESO does by releasing new regions as part of DLCs.",0.9741,500

I'm saying this because how can we have an actual headset that channels into our brains using our dreams? We could possible die from it if they were to trying to create one now and the system could overheat while we're playing and possibly kill us without even knowing. But I think an actual game like that won't be created until..we're deceased and there's another 1000 years into the future or less.",0.7046,142

"One thing you're not considering is the technology itself would forego much of the sensory development costs.  Since our brains are essentially simulating the real world for us, based off of sensory data, I would imagine the headset would be doing much the same, except just emulating the sensory data.  Meaning, the game would merely be suggesting certain experiences and what not, and then allowing the user's brain to generate the details themselves.  You don't have to record sound effects for everything, because people's brains already know how certain things sound, you merely trick people into thinking they heard it and presto.  The real issue is the shared-experience problem...  How to ensure what people are seeing, smelling, feeling, and hearing is consistent, or at least they would consistently describe it to one another...  And how to keep their own experiences consistent from moment to moment...",0.7269,163
