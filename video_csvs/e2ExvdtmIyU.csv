Are Envy & Charlemagne slow? U can't name one single dark skinned Latina pop star. Because cardi b is rachet n made it in America??? Soooo stupid.. Cardi B can straighten her hair and not be seen as Afro-Latino. She is much lighter. That's not true u can't say cardi would make it if she weren't light because Cardi IS light..& there's not even any dark ladies who are big like Cardi who act like her Bc if u r dark n u act like Cardi ppl will not respect u but the lighter u are the more passes u get. Nicki Minaj even skin bleaching ...why? After she's famous (& much lighter than Amara still) she bleaches .. Bc she must feel it will enhance her success or like ability ... So the fact that artists are made to feel like they are not white enough or light enough in 2018 is valid ..& who r char and envy to speak on the struggle of any woman in the music industry?

There is a class system among Latinos. And it goes by complexion and feature. The more real native american you look, dark skin, jet black bone straight hair, those features that are associated with indigenous peoples, the less likely you thrive in hollywood in power roles. Let's be clear, in Hollywood when they do casting calls for central Americans to play a day laborer or someone that delivers food, they look like Juan Quinones and George Lopez.

Im starting to feel like there needs to be a mandatory class in school that teaches u about Latinos & hispanics. I said ""and"" because.. They arent technically the same thing. Brazilians are latinos because they're in Latin America but not Hispanic because they dont speak spanish they speak Portuguese. (Hispanic means spanish speaking). Im 19 😋.",0.2263,106

"These dudes who are not LATINOS really shouldn't speak on racism and/or colorism in our community if they haven't been well educated in that regard. Even as black men, if you are a non-Latino, you do not know our market to make those assertions. That's just reality. Those of us who are *in* this community know what's up. Our girl is TELLING. YOU. I have a white mother and an indigenous, Mexican father. Our Telenovelas, our big block-buster movies, our Superstars- THEY ARE ALL WHITE LATINOS (Gloria Estefan, Sofia Vergara, Carlos Ponce) or at the very least, SUPER light Latinos (Jennifer Lopez, Gael Garcia Bernal, etc). I never saw someone who looked like my abuela or my beautiful Tías in our media. Black and dark, Indigenous Latinos are not as present unless they are playing a stereotype (usually the help). People like George Lopez or Selena Quintanilla who have obvious Native/Indigenous features, and nuestros hermanos quienes son Afro-Latinos are actively ignored in our communities because the colonization of Spain taught us that European features are the ideal, and the rest are ugly. They only crossover when they're American artists (except Selena, who was kind of an anomaly). Why else do you think the world was SHOOK the first few times Zoe Saldana was interviewed speaking Spanish? Nobody knows black Latinas exist, and they don't know they shit they deal with in Latin America. People act like Latino is a race, and they act like because one black Dominican girl made it in the USA there clearly can't be problems with dark(er) Latinas finding success in OTHER COUNTRIES.
