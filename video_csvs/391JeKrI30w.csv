"A WORD ON DACA ....SUCK IT ALL YOU FKN LIBERAL DEMORATS...AND FUCK DACA 

Cesar Chavez WAS INTRINSICALLY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. HE knew what every mexican knows THAT ILLEGALS MAIN HOME IS IN MEXICO. DACA IS A SCAM. The following are factual truths that i could never make up and that i know first hand growing up in California as a first generation Mexican American with family still living in Mexico.
The truth is that there are over 3.5 million DACA illegals and that's just counting Los Angeles. We don't really know how many DACA ILLEGALS there are because they hide when they see ANYONE coming to the door. There are WAYYY more...millions and millions more.
The other truth is THAT ALL ILLEGALS DACA AND OTHERWISE HAVE THEIR REAL HOMES IN MEXICO...BOUGHT AND PAID FOR OR HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. THEY PAY TAXES IN MEXICO FOR THEIR SOCIALISTIC SCHOOLING, MEDICAL CARE INCLUDING PRE-PAID PRESCRIPTIONS, etc. Because Mexico is a SOCIALISTIC govt. They might claim otherwise but they have their real property taxes go to their community's public schools and local medical clinics and hospitals for their FREE and comprehensive medical care.
This fallacy that Dad got deported boohoo! Is just an ACT. Dad got a free ride to his REAL HOME WHERE THE REST OF THE FAMILY IS ANXIOUSLY AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL MEXICANS ARE CATHOLICS AND DO NOT BELIEVE IN BIRTH CONTROL. MY PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER HAD 15 CHILDREN AND MY MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER HAD 16, ONLY 7 SURVIVED BECAUSE OF THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION HITTING THE STATE OF ZACATECAS HARD. illegals leave half of their families at home in Mexico while the other half goes to America ILLEGALLY to either work or get on welfare whichever comes first. 
Every Sunday Illegals send their money home to their MAIN FAMILY RESIDENCE via WESTERN UNION ...CHECK OUT THEIR LOGS FOR EACH SUNDAY AND YOU WILL SEE.....
DACA was created BY OBAMA to politicize immigration because he is hoping that this will be the thing that starts civil war in America. There, that is the truth.

NO DACA NO LEGAL STATUS NO MORE DEFERRING NO VISA LOTTERIES NO MORE VISAS NO CHAIN MIGRATION NO ANCHOR BABY MIGRATIONS NO NOTHING!!! MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR THAT WALL SINCE IT'S THEIR ILLEGALS THAT ARE DRAINING THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS....BUT BUILD THAT FUCKING WALL!!! NOW!!!!",-0.9638,428

Politics works from the ground up not the other way around so if you want change then you should vote and be involved at a local level as well as the federal level. Again it's lazy people like you not doing anything that have led to this dysfunctional state we're in now.

"Zappy Doggo He never called the Supreme Court unconstitutional, just what the Justices are doing. Just because the Supreme Court agrees on something, doesn't make it correct. Please review the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford if you think the Supreme Court is always right.",-0.688,51
