"Boeingemployee1989 It is North Korea, they've been brainwashed to hate America, ever since the creation of the country. 

As for Russia and China, that is mostly the governments talking, because of how the countries have been constantly engaging in military affairs, such as Russia annexing Crimea and how it is rumored they helped Trump win the election.

As for China, they're the ones claiming that they own the entire Pacific and don't want the US involved, because it puts them at a disadvantage against the other Asian countries they're messing around with. I mean, they've got border and sea disputes with India, Vietnam, Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia.

"Taiwan loves America, even though the US did not help the Republic of China enough to defeat the Communist rebels during the Civil War.

Taiwan still loves the US, even though the US is the reason why Taiwan's Republic of China government was removed from being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and is the reason why PRC has succeeded ROC as the representative of China in the UN. Now, UN has a problem solving human rights problems because the PRC Itself is a human rights violator.

Taiwan;s economy is based in US economic model, an innovative economy.

Taiwan uses American English as a standard.

There are many countries in Asia who loves the US, such as the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, etc.
