"I would use a 5amp to feed the new circuit. Hot glue gun for QI charging case to Toyota plastic? One wrap of  2"" vinyl tape for 12v to USB plug. Also run a second. USB cord and leave tucked up under neath the trim for future use. Great project. Be sure to use high speed QI wireless charging to future proof the mod.",0.6124,72

"Thanks! The add-a-circuit fuse should prevent any electrical surges, and the car charger regulates that amperage going to the charging pad. That should prevent any fire causing hazards. It would be just like keeping a car charger plugged into a cigarette outlet.",0.5411,47
That wouldn't give my truck wireless charging... I'd still have to wire up the charger to have it in my truck,0.0,22
"Thats why I used the Add-A-Circuit and didn't just tap into one of the existing cigarette outlets. Its also why I used the car charger to regulate the amperage going to the charging coils. I've used the charger for longer lengths of time (45min to an hour) and at most the plastic and phone get a little warm, which is just like any other wireless charging pad. Safety first :)",0.8363,76
"The Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 all had wireless charging built in long before the Samsung Galaxy S6. I'm sure there are others as well.",0.5267,30
