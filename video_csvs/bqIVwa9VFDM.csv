"Don't forget to stay away from downed power lines. At minimum, they could be carrying 7,000 volts which is plenty to turn you into a human hotdog.

Living human tissue can be protected from damage by the insulating characteristics of dry skin up to around 50 volts.

If not immediately treated by defibrillation, fibrillation is usually lethal because all of the heart muscle fibres move independently instead of in the coordinated pulses needed to pump blood and maintain circulation.""

A few days later without a new plate on the light switches and the garage being as dark as it was I couldn't see the switches. Walking around barefoot while feeling around the wall for it my fingers slipped between the two switches where I learned what electricity felt like.
It was such a shocking experience! I never felt more alive in my life! My heart felt like it was about to jump out of my chest and I left a rushing/tingling feeling throughout my entire body.

The voltage in a power outlet is not considered low voltage! It is ""line voltage"" because it still is TOTALLY ENOUGH voltage to get through the resistance of your skin and will kill you even if your skin is dry. 

If you see anything that is called ""low voltage"" it will be less than 50 volts. Network cables and security system wires, for example. Even PoE (Power over Ethernet) devices are 48v max. 

Phone lines are line voltage even though their normal operating voltage is 40-50 volts because when the line rings it can spike up to around 90 volts.

"There are also other factors too in some cases. I mess with all kinds of electronic things, even stuff they say not to. So far only shock I had was a 9V battery and a relay. The other thing with higher voltages is they can arc and you get too close and are grounded you're the shortest path to ground. Things like power lines are really dangerous, Ignition transformers for oil furnaces can make about 10,000 volts, Neon sign transformers are up there also. The one I hear warnings of a lot are Flyback transformers from CRT displays they can do 20,000-30,000 volts they are also high frequency which some say makes them even more dangerous as it puts more power into the arc and more prone to cause burns.  Tesla coils are fairly scary too.  

Capacitors are also nasty ESP things like power factor correction caps for power lines, cameras with a flash tube can have 300-500V on a capacitor. I discharged one of those once with a screwdriver and it melted a chunk of the screwdriver off in a fraction of a second.

"Thumbs up in general.  Things worth noting:
1) The definition of ""High Voltage"" varies in application; to clarify it seems Hank is using the IEC definition
2) Current path is a factor in electrocution - current that doesn't pass through your body core has less chance of being fatal
3) Energy available is a major factor in electrocution - if there is not much energy then there won't be much damage (e.g. static shock* is 5kV, but very low energy)
4) Current duration is a major factor in electrocution - again, a static shock* is 5kV, and may be 10kA, but that peak only lasts for 20ns

There is a nice chart incorporating much of this information linked below.

You've never gotten electrocuted have you?,0.0,7
"a static shock from a door knob can be 100,000 volts, the reason why you dont die is because the duration of the shock is very small it is sent in pulses so it does not burn tissue but enough to cause severe pain and make muscle control difficult, a taser would kill you if you put both leads as to where they would need to pass a current through you heart which causes irregular heart beats and can lead to a heart attack, defibrillators are used to reset irregular heart beats.",-0.9759,96
