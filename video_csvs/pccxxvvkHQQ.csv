"""17,000 other knowledges"" ...and nose crinkle with cheeky grin. Super cute!

I just got myself the a7rIII (suuuuuper psyched!!!) for my 35th birthday, + Metabones Sony E to Nikon F mount (the cheaper non-speed booster version).  My main lens so far (hahaha!) is a Zeiss Distagon f/2 35mm.  My other main cam is a Nikon D500 + 70-200 f2.8 VRII (the older model, not the recent E variant).  I'm a programmer/coder so upgrading the lens made little sense.

I mainly shoot with the Zeiss 35mm or f/1.4 50mm (both F-mount) as I love these for casual shooting.  It makes me 'slow down' and savour the photography aspect of things.  I find the modern lenses are more a 'spray-pray' affair and I don't enjoy the process as much - although the output is generally excellent once I go from RAW > post-pressing in Lightroom.

Big fan of the Peachy-fan and how far you've come; ditching Uni and pursuing your dream/passion was the best thing you did.  Love and hugs from Colombo, Sri Lanka.",0.9849,218

I own  an A7Rii and GH5, I sold my Canon 5D Mark IV because mirrorless is where all (well most) the tech innovations are... and I had a lot of reasons specific to my job as a VFX Supervisor... anyway I digress... my real point is that the two cameras reviewed here are similar enough that I would say how one uses any of these cameras and story matter a lot more than anything technical about either of them (Except sony battery life does suck). 

I have found myself using the sony camera for vlogging, with a cheap monitor for front facingness... but I love the GH5 for all of its utility features. I just wish it was full frame, so you HAVE to buy the fastest lenses ever for it.

That's another thing, these cameras seems to be crapping themselves out monthly now, it feels like clear cash grabs... I'd say invest in lenses more than cameras, it's amazing how a fast sharp piece of glass is way more important than anything else.",0.9807,200

"As someone who watches a lot of vlogs and know which camera each person tends to use, I really notice the focus issues between the different cameras.  Focus should always be your No.1 criteria to get right, above all else  (I should  know, as I have a Nikon D750 and it's awful for video autofocus).  I appreciate bokeh and decent colour grading, but focus issues like in your CES vlog are really irritating.  If I wasn't a subscriber and really like your videos, I'd have clicked off very quickly if that was a first time view of one of your videos.",0.2289,114
"At the low end of the market, the Sony's are just better. a6000, a6300 and a6500 have more focus points,  shoots faster, have better frame rates and are lighter for the same price or cheaper as their DSLR equivalents. Before getting my a6000 I used a t3i, t4i and t5i and none of them were able to match my little a6000 in terms of photo quality. For video the Canon may be easier for vloggers to use because of dual pixel AF and flip screens, but the Sony's produce higher quality video, which is better for film-makers. I haven't found that the skin tones are better for the Canon cameras at the low-end of the market and at the very top end of the market (A9 vs IDX II) upon seeing a comparison I personally found them to be equal. The only demonstrable difference in skin tones is in the middle to entry-level pro market, but shooting in RAW/LOG negates the benefits of this. 

TL:DR 

Buy Canon if you: 

Are ok with 1080 60p, 
Want a flip screen 
Need a more rugged body 
Color science (if you aren't grading and are looking towards the middle or entry-level pro cameras)
Need longer battery life/ aren't able to carry more than one battery (Only for the low to middle of the market) 

Buy Sony if you: 

Want 4k with no crop (a6300 and above, except for a7 II) 
Want 120fps slo-mo(a6300 and above, except for a7 II) 
Want LOG (a7s, a7sii, a7rii, a7riii) 
Want more focus points and more frame coverage
Want to shoot faster for sports/action (11 fps for a6000 and a6300, 10fps for a6500 and a7riii, 20fps for a9)
Want better low light performance (based on comparative DXOMark scores and personal experience) 
Want more portability (ie. less weight and smaller size)
Want an EVF (allows for exposure previewing)
Want better dynamic range (based on comparative DXOMark scores and personal experience) 
Want to shoot silently (all the aX series cameras)",0.9765,386

Gotta say Im a Canon fan as it was my first DSLR 10 years a go which was a 450D. Last year I upgraded to the 80D and love it. I already had a few lenses so it made sence to stick with Canon and just buy the body. However no 4k kinda let it down a little as I also have a Mavic Pro but I can't utilise 4k myself so I'm happy with 1080/60.,0.8449,80
Great comparison! üëå,0.6588,4
Great thoughts Mark! Another thing for me and 4K is I don't have the processing power or storage capabilities for all that 4K.,0.6588,25
"Great video Sara. I have both the A7SII and Canon 6Dmii. Both are great cameras in their own regard but there are so many factors to consider when purchasing a camera. I wouldn't go as far as to VS them...they're both very capable platforms depending what you want to do. 

The flip out screen on the Canon is super helpful even if you're looking to frame in tight spaces, never mind just to look at yourself. Also the touch screen focus makes life so much easier when in compromised positions hehe. Not having 4k on the Canon is a bit crap, but depending what you're using it for, 4k is still a bit overkill. No 1080 at 120fps or any 120fps at all is a bit of a bummer for the Canon as well. 

I will say though Canon's batteries are amazing, their lenses are dope. Sony is getting there with their glass and they're definitely doing amazing things with their camera platforms.¬†

My favourite thing about the Sony A7SII is the mirrorless works better with vintage glass natively. So you can mount your cheap (but amazing) SLR lenses and just shoot like it's 1975 ;).

Sony senses being exposed though need to be cleaned more often so also consider the delicacies of doing that.¬†

Oh and the Canon 6DMII doesn't shoot log which is a bit of a bummer for those wanting more image control. You can tweak settings to get a log LIKE, but not the same.",0.9872,273

"Hi Sara! Great video!  You mentionned the T3i at the end of the video, and I just want to point out that the T3i does not do focus tracking at all in video, you have to push the shutter button to refocus, or refocus manually, which might be a little frustrating for a beginner.

"I love your videos Sara but this video is titled best vlogging camera... And you promote your vlogging course... But you compare those cameras with absolutely no regard to any vlogging standards and your whole comparison 
segment was 0% vlogging..?

1. A flip out screen is not an option. It's the reason why all these other creators are standing behind the 6D ii. There's no way not seeing yourself in frame is worth any trade off

2. Being in focus all the time is the most important thing. Being 2 seconds out of focus is pretty much like having your video be 360p for 2 seconds. It is an horrible experience

3. Glass. You haven't said a word about lenses. Sony lenses for vlogging are few and devastatingly pricy, while canon's main thing is lenses. They have many, they are extraordinary and cheap. There's also a lot of good canon lenses being sold used because the mount system is old while Sony's so new. This is a HUGEEE factor, way bigger than shooting 120fps b-roll

Lets stay on subject, it's important if you want your opinion to be considered. ¬†I'm a former Canon user and I'm well aware of their lenses, which are fantastic. ¬†However, with today's mirrorless platforms you can easily still use Canon lenses or any other 3rd party lens on a mirrorless camera. ¬†Yes, you can take any platform from a smart phone to a Canon 1D and produce content. ¬†However, when producing video content and then uploading to a site like YouTube, your video then is subject to a lot of compression. ¬†So, basically you can film a beautiful video, but if you want to share that video with the rest of the World via YouTube, again it's going to be highly compressed and thus resulting in a viewing experience that is unfavorable (the video looks soft and not sharp). ¬†Panasonic and Sony both do an excellent job in utilizing video codecs that are well suited for post production editing and are also able to handle compression loss, so that when the final video is uploaded and viewed on YouTube it doesn't look like it's a lot of it's quality. ¬†So, for a camera that costs $1900 body only, it's not a good value...especially for vlogging as this video is about.",0.9623,250

But my heart lies with the GH5 and I feel like I made the wrong choice. Have you tried Sony Alphas? How are they compared to the GH5?,-0.8735,71

The original  6D was marketed as the cheap no frills full frame camera in a reasonable sized body. Unfortunately for canon the market has shifted and the 6Dii is being pitched against so very good camera's with better spec.
So it's selling point should  be price !
If canon make it slightly  cheaper then there will be people with APSC crop sensor body cameras could upgrade to a 6Dii.
Were the 6Dii has done well is in a market for vbloging something I think canon had not for seen !",0.5786,109

Then what you can do with your camera? The worst value? Many people have been using 6D mk ii for their professional photography and filmmaking for youtube. They create a lot of creative stuff and gain a lot of money. And you basically forget about Canon ecosystem. There are many third parties lense that fully compatible with canon without the need for lens adapter. You can have all the specs you want on the paper. But what can you do with that specs? What can you produce? You are the worst human of 2018 then.. You have no value at all.,0.594,112
