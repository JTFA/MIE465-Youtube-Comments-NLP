"An excellent cover, but I can't help feeling like changing ""and if I could trade, I would"" to match the bridge later in the song detracts from the emotion somewhat. Listening to the original felt like a journey with someone grieving as their grief grew even worse. The singer progresses from saying he would trade with the departed if possible, to pleading for the ability to trade with them. I've seen so many people lose loved ones - especially children - and time only makes it harder for them to go on.

Just my opinion.",-0.9188,105
