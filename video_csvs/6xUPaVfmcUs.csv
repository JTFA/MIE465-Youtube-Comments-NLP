All I'm saying is... People think NBA players are really the best basketball players in the world but they're not. I've seen dudes built like lebron on the court that ain't got no dreams to ball but can't be stopped. NBA players are just tall and they're skinny as a MF. TV adds 10plus pounds on them. Most them nba mfs are soft,0.7531,68
