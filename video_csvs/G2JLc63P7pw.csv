"The guys in that factory won in 2009. Ross Brawn believed in the car for that season and purchased the company, I do not think it was viable for him to continue running it. Mercedes then purchased it off him.

There are only ever 2 viable reasons to have a drastic livery change.

1. Title sponsor change. They play a huge part in liveries. The black in Ferrari, the green in Mercedes, the iconic Martini stripes on Williams. If they get or drop a big sponsor, a big livery change is needed.

2. Lack of screen time. Again, due to sponsorships. Sponsors want TV time, if a big change gives that then it is good for the team. Think Force India last season.

Looking cool for the fans is low down on the list. Brand recognition  for yourself and your big sponsors are the most important thing with a livery",0.6997,132
