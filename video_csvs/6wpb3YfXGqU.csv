"The thing you were saying about money doesn't make you happy... so I'm pretty much in the same situation as you. My parents are Chinese, immigrated here in the 70's/80's, worked hard - put in my mind that money = success & happiness. I'm 23 years old. I always wanted to make videos but I went to school for business, did the corporate world, hated my life. and here I am back making videos with a startup vlogging company. I'm happy now and I also think doing what you want and what you're passionate about is what makes you successful. My question/devil's advocate... is that I'm guessing your parents are somewhat successful and helped you along the way financially (maybe not but i'm just assuming because I sure as hell had help and that's the only way I am affording working for a startup company making $0 currently). You lived in San Fran, now LA. Those are nowhere near cheap (I used to live in Orange County). What if you were in a different situation. What if you absolutely had no money, no help from family, wasn't living in a beautiful city with opportunity. All these other people wish they could do what they love but they ""can't"" due to these reasons. I think me and you both are privileged and it's easy to tell others to do what you love and you'll be successful but I think it's hard to be in someone else's situation and have them go for what they want. I could be completely wrong on your situation. IDK. Just a thought since I think we have similar backgrounds.",0.9902,313
