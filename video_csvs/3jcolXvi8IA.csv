"I know you guys swear by no oil, i was wondering, if you ate out at restaurants most places use oil in their foods, products or how it's cooked, would you still eat there? Also there are so many new vegan 'food to go' here in the UK, which is amazing for those at work needing a quick lunch to buy if they haven't prepared something already, but again, a lot do contain some form of oil, would you eat this or would you always just cook from scratch to completely avoid? Ps i find you both super inspiring, you're both so humble and have such an amazing look on life <3 i wish you both the best for your future, pss please come to the UK! :)",0.9884,143
