"I love how dismissive you are of complaints. Nice! Good on you. I do appreciate your take, but I have concerns about the plot that break the story for me. 

Finn and Rose's plot line is practically meaningless (the people on that planet captured the animals once, they can do it again AND they fail their mission). Poe's plot line could've been prevented by Holdo being an actual leader. Leia busting out force powers allowing her to survive a vacuum and prevent air rushing out the door when she returns, really? Of course Leia has force powers, but isn't a major theme that anyone can be a Jedi and bloodlines don't matter? Case in point, Rey, although Rey could be explained as a force child, like Anakin, which supports lore but undermines the message of the story. Luke using powers only available to Jedi who already became one with the force. Yoda fiddling around with force lightning (did yoda go dark/grey side on us?). The First Order not being capable enough to send a few ships out via hyperspace and come back closer to the resistance fleet. Or the First Order sacrificing a ship to destroy the resistance via hyperspace kamikaze. Or the First Order not having their own bombers that could disable the Resistance's engines. The kids on that casino hellhole: 1 - being left there by Rose and Finn (save the animals, forget the kids) and 2 - having rudimentary force powers with 0 training (I saw that thing with the broom). Yes Rey is going to need Padawans. But 0 training? I don't want a new Jedi council filled with Mary Sues (Mary Sue = a character who is too good without proper training or experience or any credible explanation, i.e. Wesley Crusher or Rey). 

Before any reflexive ""Rey isn't a Mary Sue"". She can fly the Falcon with 0 prior experience. She can use force powers with 0 training in or knowledge of the force. She can fix spacecraft better than a professional (scavenging =/= repairing). Between VII and VIII she somehow becomes an expert martial artist in spite of there being zero or negative time (based on scene arrangement, I think VIII starts shortly before VII ends) between films. Even Luke's ""training"" was a joke. She already knew how to contact the force, she'd done it by that point. She's a Mary Sue in my eyes. She didn't have to work for anything she's highly regarded for. Correct me if I'm wrong, please. 

OH, I almost forgot this, how about how Snoke--a being who could toss Rey and Kylo around like play things and create a force connection and somehow, somewhere managed to create The First Order--is so easily deceived. WHO IS SNOKE?

But that question doesn't matter, he's dead. That's the take away I'm getting here. Skywalkers don't matter, we have Rey. Lore established previously in the series doesn't matter. Rey is super powerful because reasons and Luke can do things we didn't even think were possible, but he's still weaker than Rey and Snoke. Coherent, meaningful plot lines don't matter. Fuzzy dog things and an angsty Poe are more important. Nothing matters, because the eighth installment in a series shouldn't have to conform to the lore already established and Rian Johnson can do whatever the hell he pleases because the new generation doesn't want plot.

I get that you liked the movie, but you can't say there aren't plot holes big enough to fly Snoke's ship (pre-kamikaze) through. People have legitimate complaints. And you being dismissive doesn't help them to get over their complaints. Maybe IX will be better, but I won't hold my breath.",0.9213,705

THAT BEING SAID.. buy as many tickets as you can because F*CK the Alt-Right bigots complaining there was ""too many minorities! Gay agenda! White Genocide!"".

Lastly, if you took Rose out of the movie... it would be no different... she added absolutely nothing but talking points from PETA... while on the gambling planet, their friends are getting slaughtered and depending on them, and they‚Äôve failed, but they set some dumb animals free that will be recaptured in 5 seconds... and she says ‚Äúnow it‚Äôs worth it‚Äù Jesus...

What not to do with a Star Wars movie. 1. introduce a character that has no backstory and goes nowhere. (Snoke)  2. take characters that are already well established and developed and then throw ome curve ball that confuses long time fans (Luke..hell even Mark Hamill has been dropping his thoughts on this.) 3. Cram everyfay political viewpoints in. (Marvel comics is starting to learn this lesson. And as many have noted we watch movies like this to get waway from the everyday bullshit.

"lol rose was a sucky character and the reason you say you felt she was a fun character that wanted to be there and won a contest to be there was because she was soooooo bad that I'm guessing you thought that because her character was that sucky and annoying. and you go on to say how good Fin is but to me he was going to have his great character arc movie at the end where he sacrifices himself to save everyone not just himself and Rey.

Also this is the first video (to find a less hostile opinion of Star Wars)  I watched of yours and I don't mean to sound mean but you don't know Star Wars or the lore do you, like it makes me think you didn't watch any of the other movies. Like go on to talk about Leia and how this movie is trying to show she is a Skywalker but if anything this movie destroys the idea of bloodlines matter like Rey can do anything because because...... well...... plot lol, So it makes no since for Leia to Mary Poppins her way to the ship, that was the dumbest thing I saw in the movie and there is lot I can say about dumb things in this movie. You even say that the movie has ""advanced courses on the force"" for a person who has never trained in the force its dumb and poor writing.

I can say that I did like Luke not the reasons for Luke's character development but the outcome just needed better reasons, but the death of Luke was pathetic, Disney's depiction of the original characters is pathetic and cowards and any development they had in the originals was pointless. If anything I hope this isn't canon, and I mean the whole trilogy like this is worse than the prequels.

Oi you what mate saying I hope you aren't calling me hardcore star wars fanboy (you can call me a hard core lord of the rings fanboy though ;) who could hate Sam) I will admit that I like the original characters but I like how Luke came out maybe the reason he did was nothing like the character. I don't hate the movie because it didn't do what I want, I hated it because the writing was poor, there was nothing consistent, Rose was just as annoying as Jar Jar Binks, then the disappointments in this movie was unbelievable, you were right anything I guessed about the movie were wrong, they managed to f up even more than I thought they would. Killing Snoke off was the worst thing ever for the movie it killed any hope I had for the next movie.
