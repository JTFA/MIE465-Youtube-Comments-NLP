This past year has been really hard for me. I've felt very lost and empty and that my life has no meaning to it. I know that's dark and some deep thoughts but it's just the way I feel. This year I really need to face my fears and stop my anxiety consuming me. Start doing what makes me happy and no to do what will make others happy.

"This was really inspiring to me. I think tomorrow I might go out on a walk and do a little chit chat.. All fall semester I told myself I didn't have time for youtube and had to focus on school. Now that I've had a month break, I still haven't done a video due to a bit of depression. I think going on a walk during the sunset might be helpful and might create something worth watching/making.

"Your videos are so beautiful, they bring me so much happiness and peace. You make me think of the things and people in my life that I'm grateful for, which I'm not usually very aware of. I got CFS/ME a few years ago and it's been rough, but I'm starting to get better, and at first I was so so happy, but now I've sort of settled into it, no longer paying attention to how wonderful it is. That I can go for a walk and not be completely exhausted! I can see my friends and family and not feel awful the next few days. I'm even resuming my education! There's so much to be grateful for, but I easily lose sight of them. Thank you for reminding me, and for inspiring me with your beautiful videos and words to be a little kinder and to appreciate this life. I hope you have a good year filled with love and happiness, and that any hardships you might face will only help you grow.",0.998,193
