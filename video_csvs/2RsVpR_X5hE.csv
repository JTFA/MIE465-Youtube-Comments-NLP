"SOO EXCITED to see the old crew back together. 
SourceFed was one of the most fun times I had on youtube. That being said, I would also LOVE to see the WHOLE crew back together. *Steve*, *Sam*, *Maude*, *Lee*, *Meg*, *Joe*, *Elliott*, *Trisha*, *Will* and whoever I forgot. I realise it may not be possible but I feel with at least 9 guys in the show NO ONE could stop this channel from breaking all boundaries. With 4 people I'm just not sure it will be the same dynamic as it was back then. For the sake of diversity alone it won't be easy. Just trying to be honest because I love EVERY one of you soo much.
