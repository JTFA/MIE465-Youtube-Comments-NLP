"I love this video but what I love most about this video besides you guys is the retro toys. I may be 21 years old but I remember all of those toys. What I don't understand is why people are calling Zac ""Zac Cobain"" when Kurt Cobain was the lead singer of Nirvana. Kurt Cobain didn't even play the drums, it was Dave Grohl who played the drums. I say it should be Zac Grohl not Zac Cobain",0.8734,85

It’s great :) but why’s it remind me of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain? Is there a reason or is it juSt the hair do?,0.6007,30
"I’m crying- for a good reason. I just watched the entirety of The ALBERTANE tour live in PA and this is just an amazing video that will always remind me of where Hanson came from- we needed this in 2017. This brings full circle of the memories of our youth and having them in most of our lives since then! At 30 this is beautiful. Hanson snapping their fingers like they did in 1997 on their Snowed In Christmas special... those smiles that are the SAME as they were in 1997. It just allows us to know that although so many things (for better, for worse, for different) that have changed- that THIS didn’t. They didn’t. Our <3 for them and then us DIDN’T! This is so beautifully special! I can’t stop watching♥️♥️♥️♥️🎶🎶🎶🎶",0.9726,171
"Jeez, why did it just make me THAT emotional to have the clip of baby!Hanson zoom out to present day!? :'D (I think it's just because it's such a reminder of how freaking cool it is to have a lifelong favorite band that I literally got to grow up with <3 

Anyway, this video is just too much awesome and adorable on so many levels!!
