Also, she went in the water at midnight and if she got all that bruising trying to climb on the boat then she could just as easily have banged or knocked on the side of the boat, the sound totally carries thru the hull and they had a paid captain on board who would have registered an odd noise bc when you're at anchor you always have one ear open for safety issues like anchor-dragging etc.  It's usually pretty crowded there and there would have been lots other boats moored and anchored nearby, though admittedly November is pretty late in the boating season.
