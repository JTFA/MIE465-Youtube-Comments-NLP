A full egg is ok 👍🏼 you shouldn’t cut it in half I’m sure 100% it will be the same just so you don’t divide the egg in half,0.34,37

Hi Jemma!Love your recipes and tried many of them :-) got 1 question..I was always wondering why there is so much powdered sugar is going into all your buttercreams when using just 200g butter???
