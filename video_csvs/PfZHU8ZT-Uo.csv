"His hat looks like felted wool.  Felting isn't too hard to do, but I'm not sure about what techniques they used back then to create the hat shape.  

As far as the cost of the wood carvings, I imagine they would have done a lot of bartering for household things.  People were becoming a lot more specialized in their crafts and if you were spending most of your time woodworking you didn't have time to make a lot of the other things you needed. So you would trade a set of bowls for a wheel of cheese from your neighbor and so forth, whatever you agreed to.  The availability of currency was a persistent problem in the colonies and the Dollar wasn't invented until 1785.  Paper money wasn't issued until 1861. The majority of trade happened through bartering, especially in smaller communities.",0.0529,154

I always love when you might it up with these interviews. I enjoy the work of a humble craftsman.,0.8126,21
"I am completely in sync with where you appear to be coming from. When I started this hobby 34 years ago, you were not able to buy period clothing or utensils except for a few basic items at a primitive rendezvous.  You had to make your own stuff. We had to do research at actual libraries or visiting historical sites and museums.  We had to learn the skills as best as we could through trial and error without the benefit of the internet, social media and videos.
What I enjoy most about living history portrayal is the act of physical creation from the raw materials of nature, the emotional high of discovery of a lost technique or art. Continued success to you Bill, from one wood worker to another.",0.8085,140

I have made lots of tools for my work from cabinetry to wood carving and even engraving chisels for building muzzle loader riffle the traditional way and I owe all of that knowledge to an art teacher I had in high school who was my mentor and still one of my close friends that I am still learning from to this day MR Robert Fadis not only a great teacher but a great man,-0.6745,74
I hope there's more handiwork videos on the way.,0.4404,10
I keep trying to catch a raccoon tearing stuff up in my live trap but all I get is a big ol' possum no matter where I move the trap. I've named him Larry...Larry apparently likes turkey deli meat and is willing to spend the night in jail for it...,-0.3716,55

I really like his hat,0.4201,5
I think it's pretty safe to say that skills flow from our passions. Skills are mostly hard-earned and it is our passion that drives us to hone our skills to become craftsmen.,0.9062,34
I want to see more! I want to see so much more.,0.2244,14
"I want to snuggle with his hat.

Seriously though, it is great to see old professions being revived and lived. While I do appreciate the usefulness of metal cutlery, there is a passion and dedication to his craft that no industry can ever match. Thank you for sharing it.",0.9287,55
I would love  to see a beginning to end video of him making a spoon.,0.6369,16

"Love green woodworking videos, but I have to admit, the first thing I noticed was the hat.  After a few internet searches I think I figured out that it is a hand felted wool hat.  The felt is much looser than what you typically find for sale but this site has instructions for making something that looks pretty close: http://www.thefunkyfelter.com/2013/11/how-to-make-felted-hat-tutorial-for.html",0.9246,65

"Once again a very nicely done video. I enjoy so much these interviews with folks doing living history.

I was curious to know what type's of wood he prefers for his spoons and how he goes about seasoning the finished product so they don't twist and crack when they cure?  I also would have liked to hear more about his process. How does he select a design type? What determines the type of wood used? Is it different for say a ladle, or a flat mixing spoon? Where does he get his wood from? Does he go out and glean it from the local woods? Watching this video just made me want to know so much more.",0.9145,128
Paul Mckenzie I'm on your side,0.0,6
"Paul is not actually requesting raccoon or possum. They aren't really anyone's friends. Raccoons have become a serious problem for home owners and businesses alike, wrecking parts of homes, infesting houses and bringing disease and messes with them. I once lived next door to an elderly couple whose  lives got turned upside down by an infestation of raccoons in their house. All of the poop and germs and whatnot had to be removed, and the house made raccoon proof - not an easy thing to do. Plus, it cost them a bundle!

"We have had rabid raccoons in the area, and this bugger is doing a little nighttime B&E on storage bins/cans. It's leaving scat in the open yard, mostly around the hackberry trees where it eats the fallen ones so those were my first attempts. I've put the live trap (humane trap) in the barn, on the wood pile, in the front-backyard where the dogs go and yet Larry the possum keeps getting to it, but not on the roof, too much of a pitch.  Maybe I'll try a bit of honey or peanut butter with hackberries in it. I suppose if all else fails get some coon scent in there.",-0.7269,127

"What Bill said about his grandchildren seeing his work resonated with me. My grandfather was a woodworker, his father was a woodworker. In my hall I have a mirror that my great-grandfather gave my great-grandmother when he proposed to her. He made its wooden stand and frame. Some of the frames on the paintings on the walls were made by grandfather (and all the paintings made by family and friends). It makes the home more... home-like.",0.0,86
