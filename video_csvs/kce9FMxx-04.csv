"+Adrian SH I highly doubt the show will suddenly become sexist because of a female cast (and how did you even come to mention on the ""hating men"" anyways on Doctor Who?0. Sure people had reasons, but this happening can happen. Regeneration is like a random character selection. I think the show should had diversity, and take advantage on that by having a Female Doctor. Peter was a excellent Doctor, and I believe Jodie will do the same. Besides, she is young (age 35), and as I said, I believe she will do great. I already liked the introduction for her. But you are right, there are reasons to disapprove, but there are also reasons to approve. 

Everyone has their opinions, and I wish to express my own. For those who does not like it, but does want to give a chance is something I will admire. But those who simply downright dislike it, and not give it a chance is something else all together. Everyone should have a chance. So.. yey XD",0.9915,205

"Ok. Quite frankly, I didn’t really like Peter Capaldi’s Doctor, and I have absolutely nothing against Jodie Whittaker it the fact that the doctor is a woman, I just fiercely loved the goofy and astonishing portrail that David Tennent and Matt Smith brought forth, not to mention missing all of their companions and not being Clara’s biggest fan, I guess I miss the roots of the show that have had the lines so blurred that it’s hardly recognizable, and my overly-dramatic love for the Ponds wasn’t helping me adjust to anything new.

Imagine the Doctor as a crazy lady exploring her new body. Its not just the face thats changed, its the hormones and other physical things. A different perspective in life and society... I think the Doctor is gonna have so much fun getting to know what its like to be a woman. Its a new adventure that the doctor himself/herself that he/she never expected to have. .... Are you guys sure you want to miss that??? Afraid you might actually like her and it might actually be good? Keeping an open mind, be curious, be original, be the Doctor and enjoy the ride.

"Rontrm G nope 100% serious, the reason the 10th doctors is my favourite is because previously the doctor had always been with someone while regenerating, every time. This was the first time we see him regenerate, and it really shows how he actually feels about regenerating. Previously he's had to put on a brave face to let the other people around him, know it's gonna be alright. Also you got to consider he did just go and visit old friends for the last time, as well as witness his best friend/enemy come back and go again along with his entire planet (and if you remember the doctor cried when the master first died) Oh an also he was dieing if sever radiation poisoning which can have profound affects on your brain and mental state. Finally you gotta consider he's been the 10th doctor for, however long, he's created friends, enemies and adventures. When time lords regenerate they gain a whole new personality so regenerating probably is terrifying. And also the line ""i don't want to go"" did a really good job at captivating what the audience at the time we probably thinking.


Sorry if this rant Is all over the place but I CBA to proof read",0.7137,229
"Sad thing is the decision to go with a female Doctor will likely do nothing but hurt the show in the long run. My prediction is that the first couple episodes with Whittaker will have huge ratings, which will then begin a steady nose dive throughout the rest of her run. The ironic thing is that a huge portion of the drop off will likely be among the show's female viewers. Why? Because a lot of them are starry eyed fan girls who love imagining that a handsome and gregarious space wizard with a magic blue box is going to show up and whisk them away to adventure and merriment. While many of those fans probably won't admit it, I doubt they're going to have much interest past the obligatory viewing of the first few episodes for the sake of #feminism. Doesn't really have anything to do with how good or bad Whittaker does in the role, it's just a matter of knowing your audience.",0.9845,175
