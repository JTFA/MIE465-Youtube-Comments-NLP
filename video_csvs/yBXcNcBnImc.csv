"You totally forgot Turkey, in terms of cars and fuel. A car that costs 30,000 Euros makes 140,000 TL (since Turkish lira has depreciated A LOT within 5 years). On top of that we pay two type of taxes; special consumption tax and the standard VAT. For the special consumption tax, a car with 1.6 liter engine is rated at 60% tax which makes it 224,000 TL. Then this accumulative amount is multiplied with the standard VAT, which is 18%. Thus totalling to 264,320 TL! Even if the Turkish lira has not depreciated to 4.68, the cars are still extremely expensive when considering the minimum wages are at 1500 TL (making roguhly 320 Euros every month). So do the math and you will understand why buying a car in Turkey is utterly ridiculous. Even if the taxes are high in the UK, believe me it way too high too in Turkey.

Thats for normal car drivers, if you are an enthusiastic you re screwed. parts/mods and acess to a proper place to race are VERY expensive.
But, i have to admit that the Mazda Miata isnt a good car for a comparison. Mazda almost dont exist here and convertible/roadsters arent popular.
