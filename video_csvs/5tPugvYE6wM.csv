Unless in person it looked better than on camera. Yellow liner didn't seem to add much color to the yellow you already put in your inner corner. I really liked the liquid shadow, but Colourpop literally just put out similar ones very recently. The lipsticks looked pretty good but not sure I would want to pay that price for them. I don't know, I just don't get the most genuine feel from this video and I usually do. Sorry, Nicol :(",0.9442,128
