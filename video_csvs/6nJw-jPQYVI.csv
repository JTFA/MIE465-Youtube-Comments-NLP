"+fede018 Looking for diversity in every circumstance is almost as bad as racism. Affirmative action was intended to force employers to *disregard* race and gender etc. That doesn't mean ""We need to hire more black people because they're under represented"", it means ""we need to hire whoever is best suited to the position at the time of interviewing, no matter what race"". If this group happens to be all white, so be it, if somewhere else it ends up being a group that's all black, hurray for them. It's the exact same thing, and if a white person steps in and says ""Why don't I see any white people in here?"" it would be equally ridiculous and said white person would be labelled a racist.",-0.7918,147

...so it turns out Dave was way more involved with the creation of a given episode of the show than he has always claimed. To hear him tell it he basically does nothing and just reads what's put in front of them. After seeing this legitimately charming video it would appear that is not the case. The fact that Dave purposely downplayed his own role to make it look as though the staff around him were the real geniuses that did it all is somehow endearing...and entirely unsurprising.,0.7096,95

"I had not seen that Keaton, Dave, MTM clip before. Wow. Michael's being the actor, as you'd expect, and even though Dave is part of the ensemble and not a celeb doing a cameo, he's being Dave.

I was going to say that when you look at snippets of 1970's variety shows at a 40 year remove, you can see why they so consistently failed, to the point where the death knell sounded. 

But I remember being 7 or 8 watching shows like Donny & Marie or the Brady Bunch specials and wondering why everyone was pretending to be manically happy as they danced around like a bunch of tits.

And they were so sanitized that even an anodyne song like With a Little Luck had the lyric changed from damn to darn.",0.7209,148
