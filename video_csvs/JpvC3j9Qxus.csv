"I think Monique's reputation for handling/checking people started  to precede her in the circles of the industry, and she ended up quietly black balling herself. Once you start having an issues with Everybody you have to see yourself as the common denominator.  First off Monique's claim to fame is being a COMEDIAN, once a comedian starts getting serious and calling folks out, checking folks all the time, people stop seeing them  for what they once saw them, a person who can make people laugh. Dont get me wrong I understand sitting at a table conducting business is no comedic matter. Her and her husband went about their strategy incorrectly, they thought they had to power to bring people aboard to side with them against netflix when they dont. Her strategy should have been to hit the road, have fun performing again and get paid, land one or two more movies that are successful and laugh in Netflix face when they reach out to her again, turn around and contract with a different network and sip tea. Her strategy is to check everybody who doesnt side with her and she'll lose this way cause now she spiraling down a rabbit hole.",0.9488,218

"I'm not gonna talk like i understand how business deals with million (billion probably) dollar corporations work... but all i understood is this from the video: she's been blacklisted for being hard to work with, she hasn't done any recent major comedy tours, alot of her recent movies were serious dramas or Almost Christmas (which was 2 years ago and featured an allstar comedy cast, none of which makes her stand out as a sole comedy person like Amy Schumer's movies) and personally, I don't think any large group of people today would jump at a Monique comedy special like they might years ago when she was hot as a comedian. Dave Chappelle continued doing regular comedy shows and stayed relevant, even though he wasn't fucking with hollywood. All this evidence points to me that she just isn't as hot a commodity as she believes she is currently. And the fact that Charle is skeptical about her worth with Netflix is completely reasonable. So to call him out as ""against all black & colored women"" and even referring to him as some slave uncle tom, for her VERY SPECIFIC BUSINESS SITUATION is the real unfairness here. Black community seems ready to outcast any of their people as ""coons"" for having opinions that go against the narrative, rather then just respecting them as separate thinking individuals.",0.9726,248

"Lenard: 'You wanted us to boycott because of racial & gender bias BUT THEN you went on to mention 2 brothers and a woman' - Yeesssss........ and so? Monique said why it was racial & gender bias and had to give examples of 2 black brothers (gender comparison) and a white woman (gender/racial comparison) to compare pay in these groups as compared to her.

Lenard: 'then I thought she should be more specific and say black woman gender bias' - If Monique, as a black woman, is giving a comparator of 2 black men, then she cannot say 'black' (= racial) gender bias. It is only 'gender discrimination'.

She could not say racial 'gender' bias with Amy as the comparator because Amy is the SAME gender as her.  It is just racial discrimination. 

Amy's pay situation 'supports' Monique's argument for gender discrimination in terms of pay as compared to men, as 'women', irrespective of colour.

Why not jus do it yourself??? And they never answered truly answered it. Like I would buy tickets to go her see if she was in my city... like invest in yourself. They saying you old and washed up SHOW THEM. Start a fckin gofundme and rent you out a nice size stadium and sell tickets wtf. The problem is she lacks humility. She felt embarrassed about her offer. Girl listen to what they saying they might have a point. You need recent stuff that's jus facts.

"One of the main problems with Mo'Nique and her husband is that they continue call to out and attempt to take down, but what are they building? Who are they building with? They're making ""enemies"" but not gathering allies for the common cause.  Okay, you call out Oprah, Tyler Perry, Lee Daniels, Will Packer, Whoopie Goldberg, Sheryl Underwood, Steve Harvey, Lionsgate, Netflix... So now what?  Who are your allies?  Viola Davis and Taraji Henson have also spoken about inequality.  Tracey Ellis Ross recently had a contract dispute with ABC.  Have you spoken with them?  Why aren't they publicly standing next to you? Have you reached out to Shonda Rhimes to understand how she can possibly help you?  Probably not.  And why?  Because you're toxic, that's why.  Anyone can pull a fire alarm and make noise.  But are you building an alternative to what and who you are trying to tear down?  Are you partnering with like-minded individuals to achieve a common goal?  No.  And why?  Because this is not really about everyone else.  It's about you.  That's why you're trying to appeal to the emotions of common people.",-0.8343,223

Real discrimination is when you are being offered less than a COWORKER by an EMPLOYER!!!! Not  when ur offered less than a third party client by a third party organization!!!!!!!!!!!,0.7219,36
Real talk though.. what they were beating around the bush in saying is that nobody really checking for Monique .. she a hit in the industry back in the day but no one has been talking about her before now except when they were gossiping about the fact that she dnt shave her legs and they thought she had an open marriage because of some comments she made ... of your not being constantly talked about on tv or online you don’t get offered a lot of money or deals ..

How much does she think is the average wage for her audience? It’s pretty difficult to comprehend such figures and to see beyond the numbers to get to the cause. I’m hardly likely to boycott the only entertainment that I can afford for someone else’s problems. Hell I want to watch Dave Chapell anyways.",-0.9022,100
"The read she gave him in the last 2 mins was everything. What you don't realize is that, there are more people supporting Mo than there are people against her.",0.4902,33
"The response Mo gave, as many other sisters in the industry give is OPPORTUNITY. If you’re not given equal opportunity, you aren’t given the platform needed to work. And if you’re blackballed, as a woman of color who already isn’t given equal opportunity as her Caucasian counterparts, then you are given (if anything) close to nothing, in the industry. Give women of color the opportunity in ALL areas of business, not just the entertainment industry. 

Mo even tried to school Angela after she took the position to defend Lee Daniels not knowing both sides of the story. “Mistreatment is mistreatment”, although, assault is of course more severe. Doesn’t change the fact that Mo as well as many other women of color have experienced mistreatment when it comes to equal opportunity and equal pay to their Caucasian counterparts. 

How can anyone in this environment of the “#Me To” movement, not take issue with what Lee, Oprah and Tyler did to Mo?  Such hypocrites!  Mistreatment of another, is just plain wrong!

"The white British reporter wasn’t on BULLSHIT she knows it’s discrimination! However, I’m shocked at our own ppl DUMB asf! What is being said loudly in compensation are NO black female entertainers/ comedians making even one million dollars no matter how successful a project is/was. Do you guys know what that says BLACKS as a collective can’t compare to the comedy of ANY white female counterpart!!! The black actresses ain’t getting paid like their white counterparts! This woman speaking up about it means she has to fight her OWN ppl to get change in pay for the next generations! Look at what they paying those Black Panther actors??

U should consider urself lucky to have gotten an offer from a major online streaming service after having been awal in an extremely fast paced industry!!! Having a legacy doesn't mean you deserve the money of a private third party!!!! Especially when ur CURRENT worth cannot being quantified in the modern era. Netflix wad being generous with their offer!!! Honestly!!!! 

Think of this for a second. Monique is so irrelevant that this drama is the MOST RELEVANT SHES BEEN IN 2 YEARS!!!!!!!!

I am part of that people. I didn't do my research. Monique don't take Shit from no one. Nothing is wrong with that. But we know that the insecure powers that be, can't have that.
