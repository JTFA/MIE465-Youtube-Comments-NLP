"Deuteronomy 28.¬†
Its the only way to know who Israel is today. If those curses don't fit your people you're not the people. If you have money as a people, you're not it. If your people never went into slavery...in mass...on ships, you're not it. If you haven't married wives and had them raped as a people, you're not it. If you haven't had your children sold on auction blocks...in mass...as a people, you're not it. If you own factories and make great inventions, you're not it. If you design wonderful buldings and control stock markets, you're not it. If your military is fierce and powerful, you're not it. If you have wonderful technology and invent new wonderful things, you're not the people of the Bible. Not by blood or skin color...this is the only way to find Isreal...who fits the curses? If you are Israel people hate you, they make fun of your women, call you names, mock and laugh at you no matter how well you do, use bywords for your name...while you can't even get along with your own people. The curses are the only way to know who Israel is...unless you're calling God a liar.",0.8883,241
