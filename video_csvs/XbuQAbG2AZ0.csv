People keep forgetting that Jay-Z come from a middle-class household. Jay-Z didn't come from the streets. His mom is very sophisticated and is a career woman. Jay-Z uses intelligence and manipulated the game the same way Floyd Mayweather did boxing. That's just like saying Master P was a gangster but really he is a college graduate and very successful businessman. Jay-Z didn't go to college but he used his intelligence on another note to become successful. He's in intelligent Hustler never was a drug dealer. Just like Tupac he manipulated the game too convincing you guys that they live that life and it worked. Sheep follow the shepherd.,0.9822,117
