"""You couldn't find a guy who looks like Grand Moff Tarkin?"" Well, technically speaking, finding someone who looks similar to Cushing is one hell of a making. Sure, they managed to do that in Revenge of the Sith, but there Tarkin was much younger, and he didn't said a word. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it would take years of looking. Then, there's make up, which would make things easier if they wanted to. And then, if you'd want him to sound like Cushing, I guess that you can simply try and play audio of the guy they hired to voice him in the first place and match him to the guy that portrays him... I actually wonder whether it's cheaper.",0.8873,141

"Andy Miller I see your point, but being at a distance from an armed enemy is usually better than meeting them from 20 feet away. Plus, you wanna protect the vehicle.  Someone could leave an explosive or tracking device inside.  And what if they break into it while your distracted?  Now you have to fight your way out.

"Andy Miller That seems kinda backward though. I mean you're saying the movies should do it, but when one does, it gets a sin?",-0.7096,28
"Andy Miller That's a straight line from a side view.  If blasters are plasma weapons, or solide photon weapons,  they would likely curve more than a bullet.  Plus, plasma projection devices tend to beam particles out in a cone. So there's a good chance the shots would leave the gun on a bad angle.  As for the sniper fire, Storm trooper armor is really good at absorbing blaster shots, no matter where they hit.  So lomg as you don't get captured, or become subject to an all out firing squad, there's little chance of a trooper being lilled in combat.  So storm troopers don't need to worry so much about the lomg distance shots.  And your concern would make sense.  The difference is that the empire doesn't train or plan on fighting well trained,  well organized enemies.   They're pretty much a huge police state.  As long as they keep people scattered and scared.",-0.7105,172
"Andy Miller blasters don't fire real light, so they act nothing like a laser.  They also tend to miss horribly throughout the series.  The only exception being imperial blasters, giving the imperial troops incentive to engage at a distance. Besides, that thing isn't a helicopter,  so assuming it can maneuver like one makes no sense.  But it can repel incoming fire from a long distance.  That's that deflector shield the keep talking about in the movies.  The starwas equivalent of an RPG is a directed energy weapons,  which can be deflected by the deflector shield.  A planted bomb cannot be deflected.  And the empire does nothing quickly.  Brute force and steady progress the whole time.",-0.3067,130
Andy Miller look man I'm not gonna dive deep I could care less. But for example when he said the fighters are engaged. And then cuts to the planes not engaging. Well its simple. Unless you have a split screen you can't give the illusion of things happening Co existing. This us why there no point in explaining it. Not saying there isn't any sins.

That's just what's occurred around the 20-30 year mark after the destruction of the Death Star 2 that should be at least referenced as recent history, if not shown, that the recent movies completely shoved out the airlock. So if you want to out up the lore as almighty scripture, fine. But being that the movies have already retconned a huge part of what's happened outside of the movies, the rest doesn't matter.",-0.8364,164

And you have no idea what I have or haven't explored in terms of Star Wars. I had Star Wars games on several different systems and boxes of Star Wars books. That doesn't mean I take them as scripture. And it doesn't mean his sins are wrong, because as entertaining as those games and books are, no one should have to read an unspecified amount of books to understand fictional movies. That's essentially research, and it's not a homework assignment. Get mad all you want about my blasphemy, but no amount of canon or arguing will convince me that we should HAVE to read boxes of books to know details about the Red Guards and such.

While at some angles and certain light they looked fake, in other angles and darker light, they looked and sounded so real.

"Space Otter Rapid speed is a thing. Do you know one of the reasons why special operations troops are good at their job? Speed. The shuttle could have easily and quickly landed 20 feet away, opened the door last second before landing with the soldiers quickly exiting the last few feet down. Explosives? Tracking beacon? If you want to go that route, they could just as easily use the Star Wars version of an RPG for either an explosive or tracking beacon, and if the Empire is worried about either, send the troops down first before the Director, and scan the shuttle once it's back. There's easy ways to get to the objective without them fleeing. 

Since when was it blasters that have the bad rep of accuracy? It's always the user. You could give a blaster to Random Person A, they'll be lucky if the person can hit the side of a barn. But give the same blaster to a trained, competent shooter, can hit a can from 800 yards away. Bullets slow and curve given any amount of time abd distance. Lasers go in a straight line at a consistent speed. The only difference between various lasers, at least in Star Wars, is the size of the laser bolt and the strength of the shot.",0.8708,242

Yeah, we know they successfully transmit the plans, which they can do at the beginning of the movie or maybe in the middle of it, but then we wonder how they escape, or if they escape from an Empire mad as hell secrets have been stolen.  We could have a real movie if Lucas/Disney could endear us to a new set of Rebel characters, and create some new evil ones, with Star Wars as a backdrop.  Good grief, we wouldn't even have to see Princess Leia, and we might get some glimpses of a cool Rebel setup on Dantooine.",-0.9825,135

"You‚Äôre wrong about the eclipse thing. The Death Star was described as a small moon in size. Now that‚Äôs probably an exaggeration but let‚Äôs say the Death Star is 1/20th the size of that planet‚Äôs moon using the scale of the earth and our moon. Well, our moon is roughly 240,000 miles away, so to be 20 times smaller, the Death Star would only need to be 12,000 miles away from the planet‚Äôs surface to cause a total eclipse. Let‚Äôs go even further, the space station is only 250 miles away. Therefore, the Death Star would only need to be 4000 times smaller than the moon and if it were in orbit where the space station is, it would cause an eclipse. 

Also, I hate this movie.",-0.9775,154
