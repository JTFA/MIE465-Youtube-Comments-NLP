"Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song?
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Away, away
Yes, you're one number away",-0.6004,423

One Number Away
Luke Combs
xx 2017 xx

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise 
But I just wanna hear your voice 

And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying inside 
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say

But I'm still one number way...

(Edit) I got this idea from the ""sweet"" and ""kind"" Countrygirl Country Musiclover because she cussed me out over the smallest things! She also cussed out IB vlogging and Austin Gray. Austin Gray commented the lyrics to the song and she got so freakin mad over that, saying 'shove those lyrics up your ass.' I told her that those mean things she was saying were not hurting anyone but yourself and that you are wasting your time, basically telling her to fuck off. I love the nice people in the world😁",-0.4064,234
