"Sickening how could you dare have a lgbt wedding at a church!






Was my initial thought as a Christian in hindsight I rethought that and came back with even though it’s wrong who am I to judge because Christian say ( I speak for myself while stating this) gay is a sin, but all sins are equal so you JUDING a gay person is just as “bad” as being gay. The Bible also says not to hate but to love thye neighbor. So hating gays or being homophobic is a sin. I’m not saying you have to support it (because I don’t) or even go against your religion all I’m saying if you have nothing positive to say keep your mouth SHUT -Your 11 year old friend💗",-0.8799,147
