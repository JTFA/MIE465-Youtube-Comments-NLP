"I too wondered why this find would be surprising, so I looked up some information.

This find may be surprising because the Ross Ice Shelf is considered one of the origins of the Antarctic bottom water currents. This may give the idea that these currents are formed by the melting of these ice shelves.

It is generally assumed that these currents form by an increase of salinity of surface water making the water heavier causing it to sinkt down creating the Antarctic bottom currents. The salinity of the water increasing because part of the water is freezing. So these currents originating from these ice shelves already implies there is water freezing somewhere. But ice is an insulator so it is expected that most of this freezing occurs on open waters where the ice-cold winds rapidly cools the water down creating sea ice, while heavier water starts sinking down.

In the hottest months the water may actually get warm enough to expect some melting to occur underneath at the base of the shelf, because naturally ice reflects a lot of sunlight so there wouldn't be enough melting going on at the surface to significantly interfere with the temperature of water sucked under the shelf.

From a climate change perspective: melting of ice shelves  rather occurs due to decreased reflectivity of the surface of the shelf due to soot collecting on the ice, increasing the absorption of direct sunlight, rather than ice shelves melting at the base due to an increase of water temperatures.

Because of ice shelves melting on the surface, more water, already at near-freezing temperatures, flows into the ocean and is sucked underneath the shelf increasing the likeliness that water will freeze at the base of the ice shelf, making the rate of freezing an indicator of melting in the months when freezing underneath the shelf may seem the most surprising.

It is to be expected that changes in the rate of freezing at the base of the ice shelf are not much compared to any freezing or melting occuring at the surface (where these processes are powered by the wind and the sun) and most of the water melting from the surfaces will sink down and become part of the Antarctic bottom water currents and eventually the global conveyer belt currents. 

The change of volume of these currents, would at first be expected to only affect the climate by means of a rising sea level and would not be having much more effect on our climate untill hundreds to a thousand years from now when that water resurfaces and surface temperatures of the ocean start to cool.

This all makes this find, in my opinion, less surprising but more significant.",0.7302,480
