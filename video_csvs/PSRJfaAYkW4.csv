"I don't find this information helpful for actually curing or treating immune dysfunction, which arises from taking in of BigPharm meds and vaccines these days.
Edgar cayce speaking of poor circulation issues is a beginners manual to understanding these two modern starters of most modern ailments, I've learned the hard way.  It may not make sense, as such, but if you have an actual physical ailment, always look up how to treat with homeopathy, chinese herbs, american herbs, accupunture and finally edgar cayce readings intel (ie. like learning to use salt and castor oil packs, which i do daily).  They truly work.  Must also learn avoidance of external and internal toxins (ie. table salt, sulphates, plastics, BPA, GMO's, pesticides etc.) and move to an organic, at least minum of fresh fruits/veg./raw nuts daily diet.  you can not get well otherwise.

"The statement that swelling is caused by cells leaking their contents due to the presence of a chemical is questionable to say the least. Rather, the cells comprising the enodothelium of capillaries pull on the each other and make capillary holes bigger, which causes more fluid to leak out of the blood stream into the tissue. This is called increased capillary permeability and it’s the inseparable component of inflammation",-0.4144,75
