well first of all, if that bothered you, then why are you okay with this?  either it's fine when both parties do it or it's not okay for either party.  if you didn't like it when dems did it but you're fine with it now being done by republicans, then you're a hypocrite, full stop.

secondly, that's simply not correct.
https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590/all-actions?pageSort=asc
This is the congressional record of all actions related to the ACA.
House bill was received in the Senate 10/8/09, the Senate presented their finalized bill 11/19 and they voted to proceed to consideration of the bill on 11/21/09, and it was discussed and debated nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. until it passed on 12/24/09 with a vote of 60/39.  That's over a month to finalize their own version of the bill, and a month to discuss it on the floor, and passage by a 3/5s majority.  So that's the standard we're using for ""forced through"" here, according to these claims.

By contrast, here's the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions?pageSort=asc
Received in the Senate 11/27/17, and then put before the Senate for consideration 11/29/17, and passed on 12/2 with a 51/49 vote. That is *FOUR. DAYS.*  Four days from the introduction of the bill in the Senate to it passing the Senate by only one vote.

Restructuring 1/8th of the economy got a month of debate in the Senate.  Massively overhauling THE ENTIRE economy via tax reform, only 4 days.  Sorry, that's just not comparable.  If you do happen to believe that Obamacare got pushed through too fast without enough debate, then you should be absolutely disgusted with this handling of the tax bill.",-0.7165,339
