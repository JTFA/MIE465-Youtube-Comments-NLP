"Fair play. Your intonation and cadence are authentic. I believe a great asset in language-learning is mimicry. If you have an ear for the music of a language (and you can replicate it), the syntax, grammar and vocabulary slide into place a lot easier.",0.9201,52

India is equivalent to many nations put together - and all those nations like others to talk in ""their language"" (many India citizen do not know Hindi - in fact they see it as dominating/overpowering their language through legislative means).  No ""India passport holder"" can taste the linguistic/cuisine diversity of this political-entity (which is not a nation-state like many Western nations, China, Bangladesh etc - Those are Nation States, India is not).",0.8313,138
