"Honestly, I may be baised bc I am a VIP but their performances here didn't seem as special as other music show performances. For example, Big Bang made MAMA 2016 and 2015 their own concert and brought something different compared to other groups that came out. But I guess this is my own opinion. Don't get me wrong, I like BTS. I like what they did for Kpop. But they need to add a little more something into their performance especially for MAMA.",0.8875,92

I am a vip and an army too and I think it’s safe now to say that Bts is on bigbang’s level I mean Bts just set the stage on fire and they may even go further than Big Bang but still bigbang are legends,0.34,49
"I believe what you are saying is true. I do respect BTS and love their music. BTS and Big Bang are two different groups on what they bring to the table. Big Bang is the ideal male group that every 3rd generation wants to be and better. BTS already met that circumstances and currently flowing with their success and doing even better. By the time BTS hits 10 years, they will be legends themselves. They just need to stay consistent with who they are.",0.9719,92

"Let's just end this here. Sure, other Kpop groups have some good performances here and there but let's be real. No other group can compare to BTS because they have great stages, dances and their vocal and rap is literally invincible. Can I also add the fact that they beat Justin Bieber at top social artist? Yes, that's how big they are. My boys are going worldwide and they're also currently going on the iHeartAwards. Don't kid, it really seems like they are leading with two categories to choose from :)

Bangtan continue to go above and beyond. They no longer have to prove themselves to anyone. They deserve all the love, all the praise, all the glory. My boys worked with their blood, sweat, and tears for more than four years to get where they are now. I am beyond proud of them, and hope for only good things to come their way. I don't give a damn about the insignificant haters. They can only pray to reach the level they are at. My boys are beyond untouchable.
