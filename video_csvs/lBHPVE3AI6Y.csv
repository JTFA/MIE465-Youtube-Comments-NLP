"272mar: Your lame post is full of ignorance ""Decry one abrahamic religion and you decry all of them. 1/2 of the Quran consists of the Old Testament. "".
 
The damned quran ""mein kampf"" of evil Arab pagan and semi-illiterate Muhammad is nothing of the same as the Torah or any of the Old Covenant Scriptures!  ZERO!  Genesis 49:10 is that proof!

And about the only thing that damned quran of evil Muhammad has in agreement with the New Covenant is the conception of Jesus The Messiah!

That's why I never bothered to further reply to your asinine post!

Never once did evil Muhammad make the claim the ""TEXT"" of Torah was corrupted or changed.  Actually he claimed it to be the ""authority"" of the God of Abraham!  Thus his semi-illiterate ignorant self, not knowing prophesy, supported the prophesies beginning in Genesis 49:1-28.

Note:  verse 10.  All of the Lord's Law givers, Law teachers and prophets will be forever (verse 1) of only the bloodline of Judah (forever).  It doesn't imply of the Jews religion.   Just that all The Lord's prophets will be somehow having of and being of the bloodline of Judah.

So nothing of the damned quran is worthy of consideration. EVER!   Now go piss-off and crawl under another rock.",-0.9621,246

"@Bexley:  I would guess you forgot that ten year civil war Iran began with Saddam back in 1980.  And Iran was losing so they began begged through the UN to muster a coalition to remove evil Saddam and his evil sons.

It was done.  So Iran began supplying militants arms to fight the coalition and other Muhammadans that sided with the coalition.  I guess you also forgot about the 100 tons of VX gases Saddam manufactured in those three underground bunkers discovered in 2004.  And that satellite imagery of the convoy leaving Iraq with those gases they buried in Syria.  Those deadly gases Syria dug up and while supported by Iran used them on those innocent people.

Innocent Iranian government huh? Iranian government officials are the true destroyers of Iraq and their own Iran people for the malevolent advancement of their damned Islamic Ithna Ashari ideology.  Back in 1979 it was the terrorist of Iran that claimed they will bridge the gap from Iran to the Mediterranean. The purpose is to gain control of all the sea gates of exported oil.   Iran used the coalition to do it's dirty work!  And now Iran controls Iraq.  And now Iran has filled that gap.  Evil Iranian government covertly did the destroying!  Not the westerners!",-0.9834,229

He expected a 6.0 or greater earthquake in Iran, and he made this forecast on the 5th of November. Each of his forecasts are good for about a week and this one struck at the end of said week. I don't know if they did or not, but if Iran knew about this, there could have been aware and be on alert for it,possibly even survive the quake (Although the structural integrity of buildings weren't so good and landslides were very unexpected). If you live in an earthquake prone area, I highly encourage you to watch Dutchsinse's videos and livestream, it could save your life potentially one day.

So when it was someone else's turn to harvest blood they refused to give any to that one bat that looks like a liar.

Your life can not revolve around radical Christianity because it is oppressive towards others like Wahhabi / Salafi law...

Your ideal is just Christian Shari'a and that part of the world existed long before anyone wrote the Bible and history is just like that...
His Story and the religious texts are seemingly not the complete story...

Yet, of course you have the right to your belief and you can limit yourself to whatever you want to believe...
Although, it is good to be open minded...

This Strong's Concordance does have purpose...

The colonial imperialists even threw the Shah out, bringing the Ayatollah Khomenhi back, beginning about the Islamic revolution that made Iran what she is today, ""The Islamic State of Iran"". Using the CIA to mount a campaign to prevent Iranian oil from hitting the open market, the world placed economic sanctions on Iran to punish her for not complying with the Seven Sisters. To this day, Iran needs to import fuel from northern Iraq regions occupied by forces sympathetic to Iran‚Äôs plight.

For thousands of years, Persia was the center of humanity. Mathematics, Algebra, Trigonometry, Astrology, Biology, Psychology, Medicine (the first doctors ever) Medical Doctors, Music, Art, Dance, Military ... these were all ""created"" in Persia along with the first University‚Äôs. For centuries people from the world came to the Mecca of the world to learn everything there was to learn. Persia is Iran (I know you‚Äôre not intelligent enough to know that much).

3. You opportunists rats are leaving northern Iraq for South East turkey to stay and become turk mountains. 
In Turkey the turks know how to tame and domesticate savage animals like you into obedient pets. 
Or you go to Europe and get beaten by turks in the German cities. 
4. No more hit and run by you separatist rats will be tolerated.  You can hit and you can run but we will find you like we found the rat leaders ABDULRAHMAN GHASEMLU and SADEGH SHARAFKANDI who thought they were  safe in Europe. 

5. ISIS is almost finished so you can't join isis and help them rape innocent yazidis. 

6. You were kicked out of kirkuk and good to see that many Christian families could go back to their houses that was occupied by separatist rats. 
7. Your illegal referendum was awakening call for Iraqi sunnis and shias to unite together against kurdish separatist trying to destroy Iraq and fueling sectarianism.
