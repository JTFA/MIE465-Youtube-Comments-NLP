"First off MatPat, I love your videos and your theories! I have a few problems with what your proposing. But first, yes Bee movie was wrong to call it just bee movie and not ‚ÄúHoneybee Movie‚Äù (not a very good movie title). Secondly, I was a researcher at a UC for two years and we were researching honeybee health and behavior. While we were researching their health, we found that pesticides, specifically neonicoitinoids (neonics) which hurts ‚Äúwild pollinators‚Äù as much as it hurts honeybees! They effect cognition and overall (hive) health. Furthermore, the diseases are not the main reason why bumblebees are declining. The other pollinators are certainly important, but when pollinators die from pesticides it is important to consider that honeybees are one of the most accessible and helpful ways of pollinating our foods and the ecosystem (which wasn‚Äôt done on a mass scale before Manifest Destiny). You should be ranting on the importance and negative impacts that pesticides have on insects, bees and pollinators and have us theorists be pissed off at what really matters; the big corporations that do not care about honeybees/pollinators, our health and being the one of the only 1st countries that still uses pesticides (Europe has banned it)!

"Hi MatPat,

You probably should have considered this one more carefully. Just because honeybees are out-competing the other pollinating bees doesn't mean we ought to get rid of them. If anything, it would be in our best interests to keep them around since they're such successful pollinators and an essential part of our crop production (and what about the honey industry?). They've become a part of our environment and agriculture regardless of how ""evil"" they are for ""murdering"" the other pollinating bees, and it wouldn't be wise to attempt to exterminate them or to let them die off. I've already seen several comments on here saying something like ""kill all the honey bees."" That said, we should still try to preserve the other bee species.

It doesn't do the honey bee a service to portray it as an evil murderer as you did in the video. The honey bee is just another living thing competing with other living things for limited resources. They're not evil and they certainly don't intend to exterminate competing bee species. I'm sure you realize this but I still don't like how you portrayed the honey bees as the ""bad guys.""

You seem to do pretty well at finding plot connections in movies and video games and less so at analyzing scientific, historical, and practical issues in video games and movies (I'm also thinking of your For Honor video and your analysis of the Vikings here). I recommend enlisting some professional help from experts in the subject areas your videos cover in the future.",0.8961,289

"Matpat, Matpat, Matpat. I feel the need to argue on why this video has issues, and why we still need bees-- Especially as someone who's done beekeeping themself 

Listen, I understand that Honey Bees are non-native to North America and were not avaliable in the New World, but even then the pollinators that existed beforehand wouldn't be able to keep up with society's ever increasing need for food. The pollinators would be able to do their own work, but humans themselves would have to organize them commercially to keep up with crop demands. 
Even so, honeybees are extremely picky pollinators that choose what they pollinate because certain species will actually compete with who gets the bee's attention. They actually have to go out and find plants that best suits their needs and must communicate with their hives where a good pollen source is, meaning they're not going to driving every native insect away from every area. They do so by something called the ""Waggle dance"".¬†
In the video, you mentioned that Honeybees were going to have a similar situation to what happened in Pokemon, overpopulation and competing with the natives. Right now, this isn't the case, both for native and non natives. 
Another factor you didn't put into account on why native pollinators are dying is because of GMOs or insecticide on crops. They're genetically engineered so that if an insect were to approach it and attempt to gather food, the insect would die. Yes, some GMOs are being engineered in such a way that it will only ever target ""pests"" but regardless, it's causing pollinators to die, especially with excess amounts of insecticides that are still being used and if they're not careful, could crest super bugs that damage crops further. 
Diseases are a huge factor as well, a parasite known as Varroa Destructor, a parasitic enemy of the bed that relies on the bees to live, but damages the bees in such a way that it can shorten the lifespan of the bee, and even deform it. It's the leading cause of bee decline, and while species like Apis Cerena can adapt with the mite more easily, Apis Mallifica.¬†
Honeybees help the economy as well. With their huge quantity of honey that is created by them. Solitary bees don't create that much obviously, and only do so at the bare minimum. And not to mention, humans have become reliant on them, not only for the honey, but for also the jobs.¬†
This all being said, it means that a lot of species of pollinators IN GENERAL are being affected and harmed, both native and non-native. If we loose pollinators of any type, it's going to cut back on our food supply, effect the ecosystem REGARDLESS of bees stay or not, and probably put some sort of dent in the economy.¬†

Oooh man. That was a long one. Thanks for reading my stance if you ever did.¬†
