"2017 was a good year for video games.  I'm more of an old-school fan myself and this year wasn't half bad.  I've stopped buying a lot of modern games unless they are exceptional.  Sonic Mania was definitely enjoyable.
I haven't played the Zelda game or Mario Odyssey, but I've heard good things about them.  Mario and open world makes sense.  I wonder if they'll ever do the same thing with Sonic.  Either way I like the 2d approach they took with Mania..

Crash was definitely good and I like a nice redone classics.  I plan of doing a breakdown video of Sonic Mania.  Good stages and music. Some complained about the bosses though. I will say the blue spheres got old.

TMNT never gets old.  They're even in Injustice now.  I didn't know that JL and Power Rangers got together.  I remember when TMNT teamed up with the power rangers back in the day though lol.

I'm just now getting caught up on the movies though.  I like Spider-Man thus far.  Still haven't seen WW lol.  Nor have I seen Get Out.

Hopefully this year is even better.  What did you guys like the most?",0.9904,219
