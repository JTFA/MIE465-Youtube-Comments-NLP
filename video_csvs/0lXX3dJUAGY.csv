Hello there! It is wonderful that you love reading scientific books. I wish I could know all that you already know!  But on the other hand, the so called "" fiction"" isn't really fiction you know. I mean the world literature is  made up of material that is all human, very real and timeless. There is so much to learn from novels, short stories, poems, letters...If you want an explanation about this you can watch an excellent video from this channel called: 
"" What is literature for?""

"2:19 summed up my social life. Has anyone else noticed the mistake in the short arm of the clock? This is just a tiny example on why I find hanging out with most people less interesting. It is not only that the regular topics do not feed my intelligence but I feel like losing brain cells when listening to most people's conversations. Yes, social life isn't fun for people like me. The saying ""Ignorance is a bliss"" strikes me here. I sometimes wish I had a less developed but a happier mind. It is not fun at all when you feel like you were born in the wrong era. Please don't get me wrong here, I am no Socrates, Plato, or Aristotle, but I don't feel far behind either.",0.1784,145

Being intelligent dosen't just mean that you have a high EQ. Having high EQ means that you are great leaders and team players because of your ability to understand. So people with high EQ dosen't mean that they will be lonely. But there's another one that is called IQ. IQ relates directly to intellectual pursuits such as the ability to learn as well as understand and apply information to skill sets. So people have high IQ tends to be better at math and problem solving skills. So if you have low EQ that mean you are tend to be more lonely.,0.9118,108

"Emotional intelligence doesn't exist. It was a great marketing scheme corporations used to filter people out of interviews... Perhaps still is. But Goleman only hypothesized. He never reproduced any experiments. Educational institutions also jumped aboard and ran with it regardless of no objective evidence... Kind of like teaching religion in public schools. Gardner even admitted that his Multiple Intelligences were lighting up the same areas of the brain (2006).

""Emotional intelligence” is emotional finesse, not intelligence.
“Kinesthetic intelligence” is athletic prowess, not intelligence.
“Musical intelligence” is musical talent, not intelligence.
“Social intelligence” is gregariousness, not intelligence.

People like to use all these pseudoscientific terms without acknowledging the theory or even the methodologies included. Examine definitions of words and if your term meets a different set of criteria, then it is on the onus of the author to elaborate this as descriptively as possible, in order to optimize communication between in/ out groups. 

Actions mean everything. Words? Not so much. Persuasion is fine, as long as it's authentic. As soon as someone begins to use claims without any PROOF to back it up, then the idea itself, can't get off the ground in [any] objective way.

People really like to fall back on their beliefs. But that's just what I'm talking about. Beliefs are based on faith, which is diabolical to fact. That's why falling on anything other than something objectively known, will always allow people to shoot holes through your philosophy. Depressing? Welcome to Existential dread. But no amount of telling myself otherwise is going to objectively bend ""reality"" to my will.

Usually when you come to find out that your conclusions were similar to your preconceived ideas, then it'd be intellectually dishonest for you -- or me for that matter -- to  never recheck every line of reasoning, from my start, to ensure I can remain accountable for my philosophy.

If no one is willing to remain accountable and also willing to admit being wrong, when they're wrong, then there is only deception being triggered in the brain due to confirmation bias.

I assure you that if you ensure your own objectivity, then you will have no problem persuading anyone, because what people are being persuaded unto, is factual evidence, itself.",0.9763,438

"I don't know that it actually correlates with intelligence, but the point you're making is very relatable.
It's hard being completely open with people when you ask yourself a lot of questions and the answers (and sometimes the questions themselves) will not make for good small talk at all and may make you appear strange.
However, I feel that it's worth feeling lonely sometimes (even with a group of people) if you are patient enough to find the people who share similar preoccupations, and that will enjoy talking about them with you. Of course, the ones you tried it with who didn't respond positively (hey, maybe you got the wrong impression, this did happen to me a couple times) may forever think you're very weird, but does it matter? Maybe you'll have just three actual friends, but these people will be worth every ounce of your energy and every second of your time.

"I feel like you hit the nail on the head with quite a few of these ideas, and examples. Especially the art ""escape"". I found that after leaving school - once I knew I could not find there, what I was looking for - I was able to connect with myself more throughout the days. I had to find ways to fight boredom not by the force of being at school, but with the type of boredom in a sense of a ""well, what do I do now"" type of scenario. I knew what I wanted to do, but didn't know how to do it. Once that dawned on me, I literally read thousands of forum articles, and watched countless videos on youtube - both explaining in to detail the things I wanted to try to make, the things I wanted to learn about, and the things I wanted to be the best at. It gave me a sense of what to look for, on how to get started with everything that would later come. I could now, without a degree of any sort - program just about anything you could imagine. I could make you a song. I could make a game (unfortunately without decent graphics). I could make just about anything, so long as I could leave my thoughts on track for just a day to plan it all out. Every workplace I have been in, I have moved up the ladder quickly. I have learned and seen things, and have always left once the realisation dawned upon me, about how inadequate the business was. Seeing and experiencing what others 'cannot' see, or what perhaps people are 'refusing' to see or experience from a business or careers point perspective - gives me the ideas I have today, that I will one day use to help the world, in hopefully at least some small way, for the better. My art turned out to be the art of creation. Programming. Designing. Creating and Developing. And I know of no other way to truly get to know someone, other than by Helping them or Supporting them. Personally, these things get me by. I hope that some day people can see that they have a friend in me, and not just me, but the rest of the world too - hopefully then we can all feel somewhat 'more' free. I hope my form of art goes recognised.",0.9923,462

Not that I have not been loved, for being ultra bright and friendly ( I was always a friend of every group in high school)... but I have also been hated: for speaking out against what I knew was wrong, for not putting up with missteps for my path.

Also, these videos are very heteronormative. Can't we see some same sex/gender non-conforming couples portrayed as well, for a change?

Finally, while I understand the sentiment behind what you're saying (and I'm sure Plato would agree), I can't think of a worse future than one without art.

When you're completely isolated by intellectual ability, not only in one place or language, but in many languages in many places? In fact, you'll find the diversity of languages and insecurities regarding them often simply adds and extra layer of stupid on top of things. You can try and elevate the tone of the conversation, but this kind of presumption is often viewed as condescending.

Why is that lonely?  Well, if you're honest, the generally unspoken conversation for a mate goes something like this, ""Hi, I'm basically an idiot, and you appear to be equally idiotic, in ways that are not totally counterproductive to my idiocy.  So, even though it's statistically likely to fail miserably as a relationship, I was basically wondering if you'd like to get together, and throw the dice on it.

"Thank you for the video, I love the School of Life, and this was a valiant effort, but I have to disagree with it. 
Emotional intelligence also allows you to read the emotions of others, so it makes it easier to relate, as you learn over time what to say to evoke certain emotions. Emotional intelligence has been handed down to us by our ancestors who, lacking sufficient verbal language, could communicate a lot through emotions, meaning it brought us closer together. With a more complex language, the need for emotional intelligence has waned, and humanity is losing it, and those who still have it probably have more genetic characteristics of neanderthals and other ancestors, such as a larger brain and the hunter-gatherer drive to eat excess high-calorie foods.
The situation you described in the video, with the guy sharing his feelings and scaring away the girl, describes a lack of social skills. Everybody is willing to open up, and even more so when the other does it first, but there is a progression which must be followed...like peeling the layers of an onion. People feel too insecure and vulnerable to show everything at once, and they feel uncomfortable to see everything at once from another, because it violates the prescriptions of society, so it has to go back and forth, starting at a shallow level, before it can get to deeper levels. Insecurity causes this to happen naturally with the less brave, and intelligence is required for it to work with the 'courageous'.
I also highly disagree with the last part about art. Intelligent people who find it hard to relate to others can dive into many things, with art being just one of them.",0.8253,323

"This is very true and that's why I'm glad to have been lucky to find people who are also honest and open about their thoughts. Being unapologetically me from the start saves a lot of time, most people are put off by this as it's not the norm and leave in some form or another very quickly. This helps 1. because it saves time and 2. I don't spend enough time with them to develop a deep connection so them leaving isn't as painful if at all.

However, I've found people who also simply want to be honest and open with their thoughts find it incredibly attractive and they have the exact opposite reaction to the norm, feeling like they found something special and good not something different and bad and we end up skipping most of the initial aspects of normal friendship/relationship building acting like we've been friends all along.",0.9858,162

This was very helpful for me. You described my social problem exactly and suggested the most perfect solution.  I never would have thought of art as a tool and outlet for my emotional honesty. As an adept artist it pleases me that this is what you suggest. Thank you. However its kind of disappointing to find that I won't get to make more real connections with people lol ugh.,0.9095,75

Very shallow take on human affairs - one major thing you missed is what in paraphrasing Bertrand Russel words is to seek the group of ppl who are your type and make you happy. Who this group is depends on if you have a mission in life or your are just floating with flow. Rules of the social game are utterly different if you have altruistic designs and have a passionate love for fellow humans.,0.8779,78

"Watching this video, it makes me think of a certain woman who I can have this sort of conversation with. I can ask hard, troubling, maybe even disturbing questions, and be met with a level headed opposite whom I can discuss this thing with. I think without this person, it would be tremendously hard because most people will run to their mental habits and not wish to think about such things. I think I'll give her a call tomorrow. I like being in her company because she also asks me *very* hard questions about myself, my future, my desires, my life, my perceptions, my life. It's never fails to be a fruitful meeting. Like I said before, if I had never met her I would feel very much alone and it could very possibly be very hard to meet someone like that. And at this moment in time, she may not want to see me as I've been going through a lot and have been quite unreliable.",-0.4984,189
