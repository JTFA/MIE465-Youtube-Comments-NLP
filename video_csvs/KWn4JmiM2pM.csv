"+M M 
They have a ""World Award""... In most of my comments on this issue, I'm saying BTS could easily have been nominated for the ""World Award"". I'm not saying BTS should be nominated for the other awards that only Americans should be nominated for (if that's even how the Grammys work, no one seems to know what their criteria is which is why I question the legitimacy of the award altogether). Hope this clears up any confusion. Unless you're talking about the ""black standard minority"" issue, which I agree BTS probably isn't best example as they're Korean citizens... just switch them out for an Asian-American music group..... if you can think of any as the American music industry has very few of those, if any. Not implying the industry is racist, I know most Asians tend to prefer tech, medical fields rather than creative fields.",0.701,169

I believe it's pretty bad for the night time awards. I believe pop music was pretty bad this year and the Grammy Awards should have done a better search.  People watch for their favorite artists and not the best artists so that's why they nominate so many poor quality acts.,0.5505,53

"I hope some of you are not as rude as you seem to be with these comments. I’m becoming more and more sure about the fact that people are losing manners and worsening their behaviour. I may be biased, but please some of you at least try to respect other countries music. You can’t say BTS is untalented since I can guess you’re stating this purely and only on your own point of view. It’s ok to say “I don’t like their music” if someone asks you personally. But writing on the net you hate this Asian group and calling Kpop as poop it’s just a way to offend people and to try to destroy many artists reputation.  I don’t think society should work based on a process of offending each other.. there should be respect and obviously a better way to express our own opinion ex. “I don’t like his music but I can see the efforts he puts into his works. “
BTS write their songs themselves, they can absolutely sing, they can dance even better than some professional dancers, and they can do both together. This, my friends, it’s called talent plus effort, something artists from every country can demonstrate or try to reach, and something normal people like us, who hide behind a screen living on shitting other people for what they say or what they do, won’t ever understand. Live your life, love what makes you happy and don’t fulfil your existence  bringing down others just because of your ignorance. It’s not worth I can assure you. #Loveyourself#lovemyself , peace and respect. Ps: if some of you even try to tell me to stop living in a world of unicorns, flowers and rainbows, please don’t, you don’t know my life and even what I went through. What I said it’s not coming from a peaceful world, but from many experiences.

"Mugen X Plays Yes your right. But even that i don't think that Despacito is better, actually i hate it. I am from latinoamerica and people here listen that kind of song i had listen that kind of songs before but now i just don't think that should be nominated for best song or nothing at all",0.8294,60

People saying Jay Z shouldn't be nominated lol. They probs don't even know what Tidal is,-0.3252,17
"Problem is if awards are not based on sales, views, streams, etc.... and only the opinion of a panel... chances are top selling groups like BTS will never get an award as often in America they see the black people as the ""standard minority"". So they like to give white people most awards and then give some to the ""standard minority"" to show they are open minded. This subtle bias makes them overlook Latinos, Asians, etc.
Leaving it to the free market to decide bypasses any possibility of biased, racist, nationalist judges.",0.5927,109

The Grammys have always been a joke. Small group of industry people rigging everything.,0.296,16
"The Grammys is a sham. It's not based on actual success. Just the opinion of a few chosen judges. And we have no idea if the winners are just people who paid off the Grammys to win. It could easily be corrupted since there is no way to validate who the rightful winners should be other than music charts, popularity, song streams, etc... The winners of the free market should receive the awards to ensure the integrity of the awards.",0.9871,89
"The Raven I lost some IQ points by reading that garbage uh hello? Latinos have their own Grammys called “the Latin Grammys” and uh blacks are always the most nominated sooooo also bts do not posses any talent why should they be awarded a Grammy huh? Why can’t American artists be awarded Korean awards huh? And 13,000 voters is a small panel? Ha!",0.8136,72
"The Raven agreed! But at least it’s not like AMA’s or the mtv awards now those are definitely “ridged” but don’t know about the Grammys buying off 13000 voters seems unlikely and remember there are times when the Grammys choose the most unlikely album to win for example beck’s morning phase winning over beyonce however for the smaller categories I do believe it’s rigged I also don’t understand why they don’t have a rule stating that only on per genre can be nominated for the 3 big categories, like why 3 rap albums for album of the year? And 2 pop albums? What about country or rock or something else.",0.8549,131
