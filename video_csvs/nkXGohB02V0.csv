"He just hasn't mastered the art of Defensive Eating. His rookie mistake was using a plate. Put all your food in a Pyrex measuring cup of the proper size. Hold it in one hand by the handle while fending off the cats with the other hand. Even better, stand while eating since that gives you an advantage. 

With practice, any food can be cut to fit inside a Pyrex measuring cup and they come in many different sizes, including quart and two-quart. Even pizza can work.

And of course use a well-fitting plastic lid of the appropriate size on any glass or cup, unless you enjoy the taste of cat hair.",0.9118,123

Hey Simon you need a string toy cartoon. My Little Man was carrying his string around the house to prevent the other kittens from playing with his toy. They kept following him and pouncing on the string. It was very funny. This scene would make a great addition to the Simon's Cat world.,0.8479,58

I think I once managed to get him to eat a piece of pepperoni or sausage from my pizza. Does not like home cooked turkey, but will eat the cat food can turkey.

Simon's Cat is the best thing since sliced bread. My fav is the trip to the vet. The first time I saw it I thot it was right on. Vets know just how to handle a lightning fast cat. When we take our 3 cats for shots & check-ups I'm impressed by how they do it. And Simon doesn't freak out over his scratched up furniture either. We have the duct tape style too.,0.9137,81
