What if specific people were targered? Are we making it easier for people to harm others? Puts a new meaning to cyberwarfare.  
Can the technology become self-aware? Can we always predict what the computer will think or do? What about ""mutations""? Because we're so eager to be first or to make this happen - are we taking the necessary precautions - or are we slacking and cutting corners? What about the concept of human ""gut feeling"" or intuition? Sometimes the most logical move is not always the right move. Can computers factor than in when they make decisions?

The problem with snow is that it makes localization (knowing precisely where the car is on the road without relying on GPS) difficult.  In Waymo's case, this is because it localizes itself by comparing what it sees to a LIDAR map made earlier.  Lots of snow on the ground changes the three-dimensional shape of everything, so the comparison becomes difficult.

Falling snow is less of a problem.  As I understand it good algorithmic work is happening to filter out snowflakes and rain drops.  Ford talked about it recently.

"We are all bad drivers at times. The effect you are talking about we call the 'rubber band' effect. When the roads get busy at high speeds it only takes one car to tap the brake, for the one behind to tap harder and so on; before long the cars at the back are virtually at a stand still. It then takes a little while for the cars to get going again before they are all back up to speed: hence the rubber band effect. In the UK they sometimes impose 50mph restrictions on the motorway when the volume of traffic is high to try and prevent this situation from occurring in the first place. In this way a lower max top speed actually allows the traffic to maintain a higher average speed as people are more comfortable with the gaps between cars at 50mph than they are at 70-80mph.",-0.3415,162

vegasinnercircle 33 funny how people concerned about safety now when they see autobots but they didnt care before when today cars could be much safer without the AI but noone really did anything much couse of profit people are dieing!,0.8047,41

It's not wrong if it's supported by facts. Waymo vehicles don't *only* rely on Lidar, it's used in addition to sensors and cameras. Check out how many patents Google/Waymo has for passenger & pedestrian safety and comfort, then compare that to Tesla. It's not even close.",0.8463,57
"红太阳 It was mentioned, that the vehicles incorporate high res cameras and computer vision as well. Of course I cannot tell how far this is involved in actual environment scan, but I believe Waymo uses those for this as well.",0.5719,44
红太阳 That'd be if you want to mimic human driving. We almost exclusively rely on vision. But that's not the goal of autonomous driving. The goal is to be a huge lot better than human drivers by not only avoiding human errors and inattention but also utilizing advanced sensors like LIDAR.,0.8324,55
