Easily the most beautiful and emotional song in the whole movie. I love this movie to bits but the scene with this song was the only one to bring me to tears. This just adds to it. It's raw emotion and happiness for what they've created. I can imagine these people watching back and singing along to this song with pride. Just incredible,0.938,68

"From Now On
Hugh Jackman, The Greatest Showman 


I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind
Blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
One remains
Can only be what's true
If all was lost
Is more I gain
'Cause it led me back
To you
From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight
Tonight
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years
I chased their cheers
The crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop
And see you here
I remember who all this was for
And from now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
From now on
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
From now on!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home (ses!)
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
From now on!
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights!
From now on!
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight!
It starts tonight!
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on!
From now on!
From now on!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again!
From now on
From now on
Home again! (Ooh ooh)

"I am ashamed to say I didn’t give this film much thought on its release (and darn it all, I’m a musician!), because the marketing was not very strong and I’d heard nothing good from the critics. My wife, two days ago, showed me the “This Is Me” scene, and then we found THIS video together on YT. I immediately purchased the Soundtrack and we are going as a family to see it in the theatre tomorrow, even though it’s hitting digital in 10 days. I want to support artistry and artists like this as much as possible, and I’m glad that I’ll have a chance to see it on the big screen as intended. I have watched this video at least 20 times over the past few days, and suspect I will even more over the coming weeks until the Blu-Ray hits and I can watch even more of the workshop. This was so amazing, uplifting and life-affirming - and if we ever do discover life on other planets, I sure hope they have music as wonderful as this! 😃",0.919,214
