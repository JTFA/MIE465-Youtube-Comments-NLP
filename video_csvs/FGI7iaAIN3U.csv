"2k is not that bad for where she is. Those type of ""railroad"" apartments where you just walk one way through are popular there because it's still one of the places with old structures.  She could get a 2 bedroom in one of the boroughs but I know a lot of people think it's ""uncool"". I wouldn't rag on her not cooking. When I was her age I didn't cook much because I was out a lot or by myself. I cook a lot now. She probably works a lot too (for her rent lol). The toilet tunnel would freak me out though.

I can’t find the comment you left so will respond here. I’m not trying to defend her (I don’t think you can judge a person based on a YouTube tour of an apartment). I’m just trying to have you not call her a fool and horrible person cause she doesn’t cook. 

She didn’t say she doesn’t know HOW to cook, just that she doesn’t. In Manhattan, it’s basically cheaper and more efficient to order takeout than it is to cook. That’s literally it. You can’t judge someone enough to call them a fool cause of a one like “I don’t cook, at all.” I don’t cook .. mostly cause my firm pays for most meals .. I know how to, I just don’t cause of lack of time. Hope you can see this so we can continue this convo.",0.7583,186
