----- im not sure about during the campaign, but heres a couple of tweets saying that: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/23/15862312/trump-medicaid-promise

It seems like most of your arguments are that he needs more time to fulfill these promises, which I suppose is fair to say. But hes flopped on a few as well. Take hillary being locked up, heres trump responding to the crowd chanting ""lock her up""  """"That plays great before the election -- now we don't care, right?"" https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/10155727395271509/

"""and i think stating it like that kinda implies that these countries are nothing but terrorists and drug pushers""
And I think Liberals claiming that such implies such is meant to distract us from the fact that regardless of the obvious fact that not all citizens of said country are dangerous, stopping terrorist/cartels must take priority.
NO ONE or relevance believes all Mexicans are drug dealers or all Muslims are Terrorist, you and other liberals need to stop accusing us of believing such because it takes the conversation away from the primary concern and doing that will only get people killed.

""and so the idea is that every human being should have a chance to come to america""
I agree, no one not Trump nor over 95% of his supporters wish to permanently ban countries or races, but we should be able to temporarily go into lock down mode like a school when a shooter is reported or a bomb threat is called in until that countries situation has settled.

""I believe a lot of American born citizens have caused a lot of terror (more than those from other countries""
Only if you ignore 911.

""see like nazi flags at charlottesville""
The KKK is a impotent pathetic husk that hasn't accomplished anything in over 40 years. Every few years Christian extremist bomb a abortion clinic, that is the worst white organizations have done in decades in America, Muslims did 911 and Cartels did this and other atrocities right across the border and will do it in the Usa if they are not stopped - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Durango_massacres
Mass shooters are a anomaly, there is no way to combat them like there are organizations.

""Do you think immigrants are a big part of the violence and crime in america?""
No, gang culture is probably the primary part.

""How do you feel about Russia/Trump?""
I have no idea of the validity of the accusations, but the basic concept of what is being accused I have no problem with, if a foreign goverment had evidence that Hillary had committed crimes, then I see it as the exact opposite of treason to make sure that evidence comes to light for the American people.
Now I do have a problem with it if Russia hacked the DNC or any other American organizations, but I have seen DNC people state interviews that the FBI told them they were not actually hacked, so I have no idea what is true in regards to the hacking.

""Why do you disagree with the black lives movement and the kneeling movement?""
On BLM, there are nearly 1 million police officers in the United States and at most 100 shootings of genuinely questionable nature per year and the vast majority of those 100 are not malicious or murderous.
There is no dire threat to black people from cops. Not even close.
On kneeling, the national anthem has nothing to do with the police, go protest a police fundraiser or something, it's like refusing to eat pizza because you dislike eggs. There is no nuance to it, the vast majority of viewers have no idea why they are kneeling and just see it as immature spite or the ones slightly aware of the reasons think they are just sending the message that cops should lay down and die instead of defending themselves if their attacker is not white.

""do you think there are trump supporters who are just flat out racist""
Sure a tiny amount, but I do not believe Trump is racist or malicious towards minorities.
My response when people bring up that David Duke or other Klan members support trump is that Trump wants to protect America, they want to protect white America, it would be hard for those goals to not overlap on some level. Also if you don't know, Trump denounced Duke way back in 2000 as a Klansman and not company he would ever wish to keep.
Also his condemnation of the Charlloteville nazis wasn't strong enough for the liberal potion of the media but was enough to cause this so he must have said something right - https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-duke-trump-charlottesville_us_5991d6bae4b08a2472764798",-0.9991,754
"""you and other liberals need to stop accusing us of believing such because it takes the conversation away from the primary concern and doing that will only get people killed."" 
-----certainly did not mean to sound like I was accusing, I had just believed that the majority of people who are severely against immigration also believe that the whole of the country is bad. I guess that was stupid to assume, and i can see how border security would be a larger concern for people afraid of immigrated crime. Though the border wall is still stupid, as the majority of illegal immigrants are here via greencard, then they just dont go back to their own country, they hide here. A wall would not stop that. 

""Only if you ignore 911.""
-----even including 9/11, americans are still more responsible for violence in america. but again, thats a numbers game, as americans outnumber immigrants. so its a moot point.

""The KKK is a impotent pathetic husk that hasn't accomplished anything in over 40 years.

Mass shooters are a anomaly, there is no way to combat them like there are organizations.""
-----Well said, there are just too many other countries that would like to see America hurt simply because its America. Mass shooters being considered an outlier makes sense, everyone has the potential to snap and go on a shooting spree, from teens to adults. but as far as no way to combat them, what are your thoughts on gun control? I know guns are a amendment right, but i believe the gun control is just supposed to put filters in place to weed out potentially dangerous people. its just too easy for literally anyone to get a gun.

""I have no idea of the validity of the accusations, but the basic concept of what is being accused I have no problem with, if a foreign goverment had evidence that Hillary had committed crimes, then I see it as the exact opposite of treason to make sure that evidence comes to light for the American people.

-----doesnt that suck? I feel like there are some questions we'll never have all the answers to. I don't like that politics has a red vs blue vibe more than the us vs politicians vibe it should have more often. people fight with each other about the information theyve heard from their sources and it seems like theres truth/false in everything said.

""On BLM, there are nearly 1 million police officers in the United States and at most 100 shootings of genuinely questionable nature per year and the vast majority of those 100 are not malicious or murderous.
There is no dire threat to black people from cops. Not even close.""
-----That makes sense, it looks like so much more than it probably is because of the media shitstorm that focuses on the very negative. Not that things like that shouldnt get attention but its obviously bringing in more views and money than ""police are doing a great job everywhere else"" headline. I suppose if the movement was ""scrutinize and crack down on police brutality"" instead of saying it specifically targets black people would be a more helpful movement. Did you read about the Baltimore police department? geeeeez.

-----Thanks for that link, i guess yeah, Trumps response wasnt ""presidential enough"" for most. That, and im sure if trump was speaking off the cuff, he probably didn't know how to say it correctly to appease nearly everyone. The counterpoint to that i think would be that after a KKK show like that, people were afraid and needed/wanted to hear the President be more damning to them (as he is to a lot of people on twitter).

You do see what going on with this memo situation right? You do know Trump still talks about how crooked Hilary is and how she colluded with the FBI to make this fake dossier? This whole memo situation is about Hilary/DNC/FBI Collusion. So yes, Trump is still going after her. Will he get her locked up? No probably not but he is still pushing. 

*having mexico pay for the wall*
You do know there are a bunch of ways Trump can get his money back on Mexico from this wall right? 7 years left to go and Trump is still applying pressure for the wall. A simple re-negotiation of NAFTA will pay for the wall. 

*bringing back torture interrogation*
LMAO I think Trump has better things to worry about within his first 2 years than worry about that. 

*replacing healthcare*
You think he is done with healthcare? What makes you think he gave up on it forever? He already got rid of the ACA penalty which is fucking awesome. As you can see, he is focusing on the wall/infrastructure now, then he will go back to healthcare. He has 7 years, calm down.

*banning all muslims*
When the hell did he ban all Muslims? When the hell did he say he wants to ban all Muslims? He kept his promise of blocking travel from ISIS infested countries for now. This is positive for Trump. Thanks for that.

*no cuts to medicaid or the ACA*
Did he campaign to say he would never apply any cuts to medicaid? And yet, the whole point is to cut the ACA. 

And when did I say he accomplished everything he campaigned for already? Did I say he will accomplish 100% of his campaign promises? Obama/Bush probably accomplished 10% of what they promised. Trump is still fighting to accomplish his major campaign promises. He has accomplished a lot so far and its only been a little over a year.",-0.3372,382

"@dyodoublej 

to the economy doing great, i would counterpoint with yesterdays market ""Dow's Biggest One-Day Drop in History: (Net -1,175.21. Previous largest drop was in 2008 at -777.68, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average you can easily find other sources if you dont like wikipedia, the information is the same). it seems like the market is rebounding and fixing itself now though, as it started to rise by 500 or so this morning.

and to unemployment being at an all time low, consider the steep slope it has been on since 2008, when Obama took over. (https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000). Trump pretty much took credit for Obamas work there, as it has been in quite a decent decline over the past 8 years, so the trend continued and of course it would be even lower heading into Trump's presidency.

as for the bigger paychecks, if youre referring to the middle class tax relief (and the even higher upper class tax relief), look into that a bit more. I believe in (i think) 8 years?, we're supposed to receive way higher taxes because of the bill that was passed to give us lower taxes now.

And for no pointless wars started, I think a lot of people are worried with the way Trump is handling North Korea.

Maybe obama and bush were really awful presidents, but you cant say trump doesnt do terrible shit just because bush/obama may have done worse shit.

"O, shitywood sure is subtle because they know that most republicans would much rather watch their enemy die a slow horrible death while telling them to get a job (or something else completely inappropriate) than to violently slaughter them (unless the oil industry is shutdown because then they will be so paranoid that the military will come and confiscate their food and guns that they will panic and kill every poor person they see). All it takes is a little humility to realize that it is democrats who who are more likely to instigate (which they are by these movies) and even reenact (as best they could) the purge. Some will try to disprove me by citing examples of domestic right wing terrorists but clearly these people have no idea what pre-packeged news (fake news) really is since the first time most of them heard about it was during gwb's admin and both obama and trump have totally butchered and changed the public knowledge of it.",-0.935,180
"OK, so let me get this straight... they're making a (hilariously, stupidly unsubtle) jab at Trump with this teaser. Does that mean Trump will make the nation prosperous and economically secure with no crime? After all, it's not the government forcing people to Purge. It can't... the police and other authorities step aside for that one night. By ""unleashing the beast"" once a year people are supposed to be better the rest of the year, and according to the films it works. (Don't get me started on how stupid and unscientific that idea is.) 

So, in other words, Trump will actually make America great again. At least according to this trailer. Eh, I'm thinking too hard about it. This trailer is political commentary for stupid people who think they're smart. (Really, that could describe the Purge movies as a whole.) It's also a cynical, blatant attempt to stir up controversy and get free advertising. So mission accomplished. Gotta give credit to the advertising execs who thought this one up.",0.7551,202

"Really, using a trump hat template in the thumbnail? What would hollywood even do without republicans? They sure as hell wouldn't critique themselves as the rampant rapes and underage sex rings are JUST NOW making their way into the public stream of consciousness. And even then it's not like they hold one another to a high standard, go to rehab for fucking little boys for a week and continue on. Also this franchise died about halfway through the first film. It's really hard to hate people I disagree with when the only other group is even worse.",-0.9808,105

"The difference is the hypocrisy in which people get outraged. Everyone holds Obama to God like levels after all that shit he did, but try to make Trump out like ""he is literally Hitler"". Obama did some good but that doesn't come close to outweighing the bad. Trump is doing just fine as president. Economy doing great, bigger paychecks, jobs coming back, easier for businesses to thrive, ISIS on the run, illegal immigration way down, Unemployment at all time lows and no pointless wars started..  The only people who think he is doing bad are people falling for the leftist hysteria propaganda.",-0.9638,117

"The purge conceptually is a compromise, it's sends the message that evil will always exist and should be vented & tolerated. Trump & his supporters believe in the exact opposite, we believe skin color, social standing isn't a excuse for crime ever.
The creators of this irrational propaganda missed the mark completely. Supporting the purge is much more akin to tolerating terrorism & drug cartels for the sake of diversity & globalism which is a liberal thing.",-0.8036,84

What makes American great? The trailer ironically suggests Americans make America great. So are (((they))) literally implying here that Americans make America worse?
