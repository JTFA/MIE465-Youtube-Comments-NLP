"Gerwig's use of ""Crash"" is what a lot of songwriters hope: an interpretation that reveals a deeper meaning the second or third time we hear the song. Some movies use pop songs to market by tie-in. Lady Bird's use of ""Crash"" for three plot points draws the audience close to several characters in ways we seldom come close in daily life. Special stuff.",0.6808,72
