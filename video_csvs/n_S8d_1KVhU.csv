Awesome video,0.6249,2
"Back-illuminated sensors have been around since like the 90's, in industry and science fields. They're much more difficult to create in CMOS sensors because the silicon construction of CMOS sensors contains a lot of logic circuitry on the backside of the die, blocking much of the light and thus reducing the advantage of BSI. Science / industry almost exclusively use CCD sensors, both now and historically, which are almost universally superior to CMOS sensors, in all but two areas; cost and high-speed imaging.

Almost all the advanced techniques and technologies being incorporated in CMOS sensors *now* were invented for CCD sensors 30 years ago.

While it's great that Sony, Canon, etc are making awesome consumer CMOS sensors that are extremely impressive for their price, there's also a reason that science, medicine and astronomy imaging sensors are made by obscure companies that nobody has heard of - or a few of the big names like Kodak and Sony (mostly Kodak). Because they're separate divisions within those companies. Most of this stuff is invented on CCD systems and backported to CMOS. In many cases CMOS can only emulate CCD behavior, because it's a physically different type of silicon device.

Look at DSLR images or video from the Space Station. It's riddled with stuck or dead pixels, and due to the Bayer pattern this means color artifacts too. And these haven't even been up there for that long, nor have they been exposed to particularly harsh environments - after all, they're being used by astronauts.

I understand what you're saying. But you need to understand what consumer technology is, and what it isn't.

The cost of 100 DSLR sensors is an immeasureable drop in the bucket for a satellite like in this video. Literally not even a percent, or a percent of a percent. But it's the *wrong sensors to use*. For contrast, large CCD sensors used for DNA sequencing cost comfortably over 100'000$ ..... each. And those are basically mass production sensors compared to the specialty specced and verified sensors used on space telescopes.",0.9267,388
"Because visible spectrum is ""almost"" the least important information. Infrared and Ultraviolet is of more interest to meteorologists. And DLSRs are built for relatively close up imaging. Huge pixel count only gets you that type of information if you have a lens that can get the light in the right place to be captured.",0.6125,60
Bob Jones Thank you I was about to say the same thing.  These images are not for human consumption so you can't pull off lossy compression without compromising the integrity of the data.  I would think they use compression when sending the data down and the data should be ripe for compression.  The bitmaps should have large swaths of locations with the same value and the bitmaps themselves should have a lot of similarity between each other.  I'd be surprised if a compression ratio of 2 isn't possible.  I'd expect something closer to 10.,0.6709,100

Fabricated. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. When a scientist uses the word fabricated they are being genuine because most images are not taken in wavelengths humans can see. Additionally they have to correct for aberrations cause by atmospheric effects or geometries that aren't easy to take pictures of. Try wrapping a soccer ball with wrapping paper. You won't be able to make it perfectly smooth. The same things happen when you try to take a picture (2D image) and wrap it around a 3D object. Certain parts of the image get stretched. So depending on what you are trying to observe you enhance the image to get a better understanding of what is actually there. So yes in an honest sense all NASA images are enhanced and altered so that the most useful information can be obtained. The images are really expensive to get so they have to try and squeeze as much data from each image as possible.,0.9458,184

The images ABI brings down is incredible. During non-critical weather days we point the Meso scans at Cape Canaveral and are actually able to see rocket launches using the IR bands. It's pretty neat, you can get about 4-8 frames of the ascent. Occasionally, volcano eruptions are so powerful you can see the shockwaves ripple through South American forests. (We have a workstation dedicated to monitoring real time products. The operators love it and show us cool crap they found all the time)

One neat note about GLM, it's actually really useful in predicting tornados.

"If you search for 'HS_D_users_guide_en_v12' or just 'Himawari 8 Users Guide', you should find a pdf that has all the specs you need to calculate the storage needs as well as the minimum bandwidth required. It has the valid number of bits per pixel for each band, what the resolutions are, what the observation areas are, how often they make observations for those areas and so on.

I did the math, just for the giggles.

For clarification this is *all the data* Himawari 8 gathers *during a 10 minute window* , some observations are once every 10 minutes, some are once every 2.5 minutes while some are once every 30 seconds. So these calculations take in to account every observation it makes during a 10 minute window.
Using the appropriate valid number of bits per pixel for each band = 2196.2 megabytes or 2.144 gigabytes.
If you want to move that amount of data in 10 minutes or under you'd need around 31Mbit/s of bandwidth. (bare minimum)
For reference, the valid number of bits per pixel varies from anywhere from 11 to 14.

I'm not sure why but the block structure in the users guide says 16 bits per pixel (""fixed value"", maybe it's how they format the data) for the files so I'll give you numbers for that as well.
16 bits per pixel for all bands = 2486.2 megabytes or 2.42 gigabytes. For that you'd need around 35Mbit/s. (bare minimum)

The actual files however (which you can download) are using the valid number of bits per pixel.
For example, the calculated size for a 11Kx11K image at 11 bits per pixel is 158.667 megabytes.
The largest image I found on the official website was 156.7MB. So quite close.
Keep in mind that the calculated size is the absolute maximum for an image of that size with that many bits per pixel. The actual size depends on what the image shows. Brighter the image, larger it is. Darker the image, smaller it is. 11Kx11K is a square. Earth is a globe. Space is dark. You follow?
Around noon, the full disk 11Kx11K images are around 150-156MB in size, during the night they can be as small as under one megabyte which is basically 100% black body as from Himawari 8's point of view the earth isn't lit at all by the light from the sun. The smallest images where you can actually still see the earth (a sliver of it) are a little under 4MB in size.",0.5746,486

"While impressive technical achievements it always bugs me how much the performance of these fancy aerospace systems lags behind consumer tech. 
im sure there are very good reasons for why we cant just strap commercial of the shelve stuff to satellites and I would definitely like to see a deep dive on that subject but Its still quite odd to think about.
like sure the resolution is pretty good but the overall amount of data collected per unit of time seems decisively unimpressive compared to consumer tech even when considering there are 16 channels instead of 3 and the bit depth is probably something like 16bit. 
consider that a modern mirror less camera can have 16bit capture at 40Mpx in the palm of your hand. 
assuming you need to take one frame for every spectral band and 10 to capture the whole disk and match the 400Mpx resolution that means that in 160 shots of a handheld consumer device, using maybe 10watts of power, you could match the data captured by this car sized state of the art satellite using 4KW.
If our camera was able to work at 2fps it would capture the full 16 bands at 400mpx in 1min 20sec. more than 10 times faster than our satellite! 
I wonder what nuances go into these systems that make them lag so far behind what a back of the envelope calculation given available tech would suggest. after all a huge amount of thought must have been put into them.",0.971,261

I think another part of the explanation is the time it takes to get something flight rated. after all you better damn well make sure everything is incredibly reliable before you book a rocket launch.
