"[Verse 1] 
Starry, starry night 
Paint your palette blue and gray 
Look out on a summer's day 
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 
Shadows on the hills 
Sketch the trees and the daffodils 
Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
In colors on the snowy linen land 

[Chorus] 
Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen, they did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 

[Verse 2] 
Starry, starry night 
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
Swirling clouds in a violet haze 
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue 
Colors changing hue 
Morning fields of amber grain 
Weathered faces lined in pain 
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand 

[Chorus] 
Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen, they did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 

[Bridge] 
For they could not love you 
But still your love was true 
And when no hope was left in sight 
On that starry, starry night 
You took your life, as lovers often do 
But I could've told you, Vincent 
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you 

[Verse 3] 
Starry, starry night 
Portraits hung in empty halls 
Frameless heads on nameless walls 
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget 
Like the strangers that you've met 
The ragged men in ragged clothes 
The silver thorn on the bloody rose 
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 

[Outro] 
Now I think I know 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen, they're not listening still 
Perhaps they never will",0.031,336
