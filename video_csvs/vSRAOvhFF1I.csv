"If you chose to follow Tyler's example, if you're donating to a homeless shelter, one things they're ALWAYS short on is feminine hygiene products. A lot of the time they're pretty okay with food (I mean, they can always use more but they're not extremely desperate), whereas things like pads and tampons they rarely ever have enough of because people just don't think to donate that kind of thing.

He loves you! He is NOT angry at you, so please don't believe the devil's lies. 

Jesus DIED and on the 3rd day, ROSE again to redeem us back to Himself. He loves us that much! 

Hell was not created for us, friends. It was created for the devil, and the devil is trying take as much people with him there. This is why the devil hates Jesus, because Jesus Alone made a Way, that is Himself, back to God! Hallelujah! 

So please friends, make Jesus your Lord and Savior today if you haven't already. Call upon Him in Truth, and you will be saved! Hallelujah!

To die without Jesus is very dangerous and eternal. 

Shalom.",-0.8552,160

Noone understands me i feel like but i have this insanely big crush on this one kid who is straight since the summer and it has grown way further than a crush. I keep thinking about him and I told him how I felt and he blocked me on everything. Im an idiot for even falling for someone that is straight but now i have this empty hole inside of me and i am always sad. Never will i do anything stupid to myself because of sadness but im just feeling super depressed and lonely. i tried talking to other guys that are actually gay but he still is on my mind when im with them. he constantly think about him getting with other girls and i hear about him doing it and my heart literally stops. i am just tired of crying over him all the time. is there anything i could do to maybe get over him? thanks",-0.9819,193
