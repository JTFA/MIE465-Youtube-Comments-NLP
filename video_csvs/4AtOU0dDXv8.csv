The best respect is fear and well I havnt done anything like that and my dad beat me unmercifully for doing dumb shit with everything from a belt to tree switches coincidence I think not. I mean if you have a kid that's fucked in the head if that kid learns his lessons through pain he will think twice before doing anything questionable just common sence you do the same with dogs which depending on the breed can be as smart as a 25 year old just saying. Now I'm not saying bear down and knuckle up on the kids unless they put themselves in that situation but snatch em up by the scruff of their necks and take that belt to em till they understand that you are bigger and stronger than them and that you ain't going to put up with they're bull shit.

Self defense is a human right, and to then say that a tool for self defense isn't allowed isn't just law.  
Kennesaw, Georgia is a town where they required there to be a gun in every household.  The murder rate is very low there.  It is less than the safest European countries.  Minnesota saw a record number of gun sales in 2016 and had a record number of people with permits to carry in 2017.  2017 saw Minnesota's lowest rate of violent crime since 1965.  This shows that the often made claim that more guns equals more crime isn't true.  It was, for all practical purposes, illegal to carry a gun in 49 of the 50 states for about a 30 year period starting in the mid-1960s.  The homicide rate in the USA was between double and triple what it had been for that entire period.  The restrictions were eased in the 1990s and the homicide rate quickly dropped to what it had been before.  We've had a slow but steady decline in the homicide rate since despite a huge increase in gun sales.  
The UK is not immune from violence despite the strict restrictions on firearms in your country. I still think of a man who was walking across a bridge and attacked by two people.  They eventually knocked him unconscious and tossed him in the river where he was found drowned after day light.  These two ghouls were waiting by that bridge specifically to murder a random passerby.  Had Her Majesty's Government allowed people to carry guns he would have had a much better chance of survival.  People are forced to choose between arming themselves and perhaps being charged with a felony which would harm future employment prospects or perhaps being a victim.  This is not just in any way. Law abiding people in my state have that same dilemma.  I'm fortunate in that I live in a region of California where the sheriff's will grant a carry permit to anyone who passes a criminal background check.  The folks in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Contra Costa Counties are not so fortunate.  The sheriff in Contra Costa County will deny a law abiding citizen a carry permit if a neighbor objects, and there is always a neighbor who objects in that county.  The only people who are granted carry permits in those counties are the one's who know a mayor or some other local politician.  Diane Feinstein (who's been scheming to outlaw guns since at least the 1990s) had a concealed carry permit in San Francisco.  She also has armed protection that we the taxpayers foot the bill for while she tries to outlaw private ownership of guns.  She is also from the party that keeps turning the violent people out of prison.",-0.9942,563

"quit using little kids to do your BS of soros demorat russian narritive you discusting morons !!! real news....Facts the left doesn’t want you to know:
There are roughly 30,000 gun deaths per year, or .000000925% of the population.
• 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws.
• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified.
• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – better known as gun violence.
• 3% are accidental discharge deaths.
So technically, ""gun violence"" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Now let’s look at how those deaths spanned across the nation.

• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago
• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore
• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit
• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)
So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.  This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state on average.  
So the areas with the strictest gun laws, produce the most gun violence.  
How does gun death by criminals compare to other deaths? 
• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!
• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths.
• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities
Now it gets good:
• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital!
• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).
A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides. 
So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple:

Taking away guns gives the government more control of its people. The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and disarm the populace. 

So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed,

you are right. The rest of the civilized world has solved their problems with guns and have no mass murders. the nra/kkk GOPedophile party is just spoiled. they don''t think they should have to give in at all. they could compromise if they wanted to...but the small penis syndrome is HUGE in the South!,-0.3311,63
