"You have two choices...learn from these wonderful videos or wait until life throws you a curveball. I was born intelligent, physically normal and surrounded by “normal” family and friends. My mother was diagnosed with cancer when I was 23 and in the ensuing years went from slightly disabled to blind and unable to walk. The challenges of caring for a disabled person is something you truly cannot understand until you are forced into the situation. Only then do you realize how difficult and inaccessible every tasks can be. Just living can be a challenge but you learn and become a better person for the experiences. Though my mother has long since passed the experiences I shared with her remain. When you see someone struggling to get through a door, help. Don’t act like it’s a big favor and don’t treat them differently. Just hold the door open and smile. It doesn’t take much effort to be a kind and empathetic person.",0.985,186
