"""I promise you it'll all make sense again"" ~ but not today",0.1655,14
"""There's nothing to do right now but try
There are a hundred people who will listen to you cry
And I get that they don't get it
But they love you so much that you won't regret it""
I absolutely love this part. It makes me feel like I can go on, and the people who will be there for me love me, so even if they can't relate, or they don't understand, they are still there for me always, and that's more important. I really relate to this song, and I used it today when I felt really bad. I'm waiting for the day when I can say I'm okay and mean it, and i have the people who will listen to me cry to help me get there. Even though it seems like nothing will ever work out and there's nothing left and I just don't want to be here anymore, I remember to live for my close friends and family. A friend of mine took her own life in December, and I dedicated my 2018 to living for her, since she cannot anymore, so I know that i have to go on. If anyone here wants someone to talk to, I am always willing to talk, even if it's just someone looking for a new friend. <3 ""The one thing that's sure is that there is no cure, but that doesn't mean we don't fight,"" ""You find some way to survive, and you find out you don't have to be happy at all to be happy you're alive.""",0.9952,291

The kite falls apart when the lyrics mention the difficulties in life, but it's always soaring through everything steadily while she sings ""i promise you, it'll all make sense again"" as if her words are keeping it afloat. Even while it's flying, it's passing through hardships like trees dying and smoke from chimneys, but the motif of the song is what keeps it trudging on, leaving the listener/viewer with a sense of encouragement and empathy from dodie. It even gets more sporadic and intense at the end, but then people start harmonizing with her and we're left in a field of people with their kites and their own individual journeys and a warm, larger harmony that supports the subject when it was seemingly needed most.
