"FOR THE 10 MILLIONTH TIME, THIS IS A REMAKE OF THE BROADWAY MUSICAL THAT'S BASED ON THE MOVIE! NOT THE ACTUAL MOVIE. To be honest FOX could've made that more  clear but i guess they thought people would just assumed it was the musical because all the past tv live versions of musicals have had the same name format eg. Hairspray Live! Grease Live! Peter Pan Live! Sound of Music Live!. Then again I guess most people who have seen the movie probably don't know there's a musical adaptation for it... yikes... Anyway, as someone who knows the musical i give this a 7/10. Well acted & well performed. I've never really connected to the story in both the movie and the musical but I've always loved the music and the choreography. Good job to the cast.",0.9626,153

"Here we go again.  We have to change the demographics of a popular movie to satisfy a few.  Interesting to note that if the original A Christmas Story was centered on a black family in a black community then the Live version remake would have kept the characters black and in a black community.  Whites be damned.  However, of course, in the remake we have to throw in some diversity and blacks must not feel as though they are not included.  Blacks account for such a small percentage of the population and yet they are featured more than Hispanics and Asians in advertising.  Now I find that interesting.",0.872,117

I suggest just a few less big numbers...not every scene has to be a show stopper, leg kicker, Radio City Ricket style dancing. I was looking for warm Christmas memories...too sexually inuendoed school teacher scene ...breathy singing? Please...too much singing...should have had more stiry line and dialogue.
