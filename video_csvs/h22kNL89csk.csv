"(ghostsade3) Welsh speaker here.  Your advice is pretty good but I'd describe it somewhat differently.  Place the sides of your tongue lightly against the inside of your upper teeth.  The front of the tongue can be held very lightly against the top of the mouth.  Then hiss air through the small gaps between the tongue and the upper teeth.  As you pass from the ""ll"" to the following vowel lower your tongue away from the teeth and roof of the mouth.  Whatever you do don't follow the double-l by an ordinary English ""l"", which will happen if you don't lower your tongue away from the roof of your mouth.",-0.09,124

"Thank you very much for this video, it helped convince me that I am pronouncing it correctly. For people who want to know how to pronounce it, here's some advice that worked for me (may not work if you speak naturally differently than me): Put your tongue where you would to say an ""L"", but then breathe air out just like ""H"". Once you think it sounds decent, practice it so that you can make it without any effort and that you don't have to think about it (didn't take long for me). It actually is a pretty simple sound, just like ""S"" or ""F"", it's just not commonly heard by Americans.",0.9217,134
