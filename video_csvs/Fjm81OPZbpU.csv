"Dude he's been helping the poor by creating millions of jobs and even lowering taxes for them and increasing the child tax credit. Did you know black unemployment is at an all-time low??? Even black homeownership is going up. These positive changes are a direct result of Trump's policies. There are many ways he has already helped the poor and he is continuing to help them. But ignorant people like J.Cole ignore these facts, and the sheep who believe everything these rappers say just eat it up. Nobody bothers to learn the actual truth. They just bash Trump because it's the ""cool"" thing to do right now. And I think that's totally lame! People are a bunch of followers!!",-0.7192,135

"It matters because he first accused Trump of ""manipulating poor white folks"", which is a lie, and then he said Trump was ""blind to the struggles"" of people with pigment. It's not my fault that J Cole decided to politicize the song. Actors and musicians are extremely uninformed when it comes to politics and they generally should just avoid the topic altogether. How exactly did Trump ""manipulate poor white folks""? What is his basis for this? Because Trump recently created a tax plan that is actually going to help poor people significantly, REGARDLESS of race. J Cole just took this song as an opportunity to bash Trump because it's the ""cool"" thing to do right now. Everyone is doing it because they're all followers. I was enjoying the song until they decided to inject politics into it and insult ""poor white folks"". I'm not even white, I'm Colombian. But musicians and actors need to stop doing that. They are not politicians and are not educated or knowledgeable in that field.",-0.9442,196

"Well I was digging this song before they took a shot at my President. I am Hispanic and the grandchild of immigrants. I support President Trump 100%. Calling his supporters ""ignorant white folks"" is racist and you're also stereotyping over 63 million people across the nation who voted for him. I know both Blacks and Hispanics who voted for Trump. Why do musical artists always want to make ignorant and inaccurate political comments like that? It's sad...  I wanted to buy this album but I can't support artists who stereotype people who support the president and make racial comments about them. Very disappointing, I expected better from Miguel and J.
