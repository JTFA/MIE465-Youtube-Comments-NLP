Benefit why would anyone test a mascara for 36 hours and how without sleeping with it on? The only thing that comes to mind is international flights. But still from Orlando to Syndey it is about 22 hours with 1 stop. I'm still impressed that a mascara could stay on so long. Jeez. Thanks Allie.,0.7943,61

"Hi Allie!  I work for Benefit at Ulta!  I wanted to let you know what might be causing the smudge around your brow.  BADgal Bang! is water resistant. This means it works just like waterproof mascara, but it doesn't contain tar as an ingredient.  While water won't move it, any kind of oil will.  My recommendation for removal is some kind of oil-based remover, coconut oil, baby oil, etc.  *If you have oily eyelids, even a little bit, your natural oil will start to break down the formula!*

I loved your review!  Keep on trending!!!",0.9205,117

I have really long lashes but they're pretty straight. I have to heat my lash curler and set the curl with a waterproof mascara, or they're straight an hour later. I wonder how well this holds the curl for hard to curl lashes. I may try a mini size, I have a hard time spending much of mascaras!",0.8942,105

Thank you for this review Allie. I bought the mini from Sephora. I like when they let you try the mini version before you buy a full tube.
