"Don't skate on thin ice, if it breaks you could drown.  Its hard to crawl out of the ice -- try getting out of a swimming pool without a ladder or anything to push on with your feet.  Also, imagine that the edge of the pool is slippery ice.  Plus, if you manage to pull yourself out on the edge of the ice it may break again.  Not only that, imagine climbing out of that pool with wet winter clothes on.   Additionally, the shock of being immersed in freezing water limits your ability to do anything -- try wading in the ocean in the winter at a beach.  The video suggests that you go on the thin ice with friends who can help you -- assuming they're brave enough to approach the broken ice -- the ice that broke with the load of the first person is now weakened by having a hole in the ice.   

If you are going to skate on thin ice, do it somewhere that you know the water isn't deep.  Knee deep water is a lot easier to escape from!  Take a ladder with you so that a rescuer can spread his weight over a large area.  Or a light weight canoe.

Any time you're on lake ice, bear in mind that the ice formation is not of a uniform thickness and can be thinner in some places. Often lakes will have open water near where a stream enters or exits.

The best rule for judging ice safety:  
Only skate on ice that already has other people skating on it!

Having said all of the above, skating on beautiful fresh smooth ice is an absolute pleasure.

"Honestly, this sound and the black ice always creeped me out, when I was a teen. In Germany, I used to skate on the lake as well with classmates and the black ice, which existed far away from the lakeshore, looked beautiful with its even and black look, but it was also frightening. It's sorta like swimming on the ocean and you can't see what's deep down there. The difference between the ocean and a frozen lake, is that you are screwed if you break in. Now and then, even on the thicker part of the lake, it produced such sound, which was just frightening as well. It was fun to skate on a lake, but I was always tense. Couldn't shake the idea off that the ice might break. I haven't done that for almost 20 years now and most likely never will. The weather conditions are too unstable and I don't trust the national approval broadcasted via radio anymore. There wasn't such a thing in many years anyway, due to mild to none existent winters. I'm glad that I experienced real summers and winters in my childhood and youth. Nature sure has changed.",0.456,219

I got a bit too cooky, crossed into an even thinner area, oops time to turn but it was to late..... Well ""no big deal to take swim""..... I grabbed my ice-pods (always hanging high around my neck) dug them in and pulled, expecting to soon be on ""solid ground"".....
