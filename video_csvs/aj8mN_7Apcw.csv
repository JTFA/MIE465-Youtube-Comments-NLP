"About the eyes.

What made them good in the manga was that Kishiro had an amazing talent at drawing faces and facial expressions, especially the eyes. Her‚Äôs were slightly bigger than average at best (compared to other material they look normal af), but they were still proportional to her overall face/head. They mostly stood out because he drew them with such beauty and depth.

Also, you know how attractive eyes always stand out compared to other facial features? That always makes them appear bigger. That doesn‚Äôt mean it works the other way around Mr. Rodriguez, you‚Äôve turned Alita into a ‚Äúphotoshop fail‚Äù. Please fix it.",0.9631,130

"Dear 20th Century Fox, please inform James Cameron that as much as I respect his work, the large eyes occur in the manga because it's an art style and almost every single character has large eyes (admittedly few quite as large as hers). To have Alita as the only character (including other cyborgs) with large eyes though, let alone ones so disproportionately huge is frankly both out of place and eerie.
It just doesn't fit, and it's seriously damaging what should otherwise be a much loved movie that I would hope would otherwise appeal greatly both to old Gunnm fans and newcomers.",0.7762,113

I mean doesn't do justice  to the manga, I know i know... adaptations, still we could do more, no? blade runner, even the new Netflix series Altered Carbon ( that i certainly recommend) that has the similar theme give us the sensation vibe  that Gunnm supposed  to have. In any case, I am a bit disappointed, it's  just a few adjusts  for this movie be great, seems that they are lauching only for box office sales...please do not waste a great story with such a amazing content,  and for what I see the casting is great.",0.982,250

"I wish they'd stick to the 80s style anime background, tbh I just watched the anime recently it was great ,it kinda remind me about Akira ( which needs a live action ) and in some way it has a lot of similarities to Akira , but the director is in charge , depending on his actions lies the story which it will tell.",-0.0772,67

"I'm a huge fan of Battle Angel Alita. It's one of my favorite mangas and I've been waiting for years for fellow fan James Cameron to adapt it into live action. So I was ecstatic when I found out that was finally becoming a reality. Then when the trailer first came out I immediately watched it and, like many people, I was initially put off by her eyes. I though that just because it's based on a manga/anime doesn't mean she has to have big anime eyes. But a day later, I realized why the choice makes sense, manga roots or no, and why it works artistically. The image is jarring because she looks almost human but not (the uncanny valley). But THAT'S THE POINT. ALITA'S NOT HUMAN. So it doesn't matter whether she came from a Japanese manga, a French graphic serial, or even a Marvel or DC property. It still makes sense to give her an inhuman trait. Whether someone can look past that or not is up to the viewer. Personally, I've now embraced the choice and still cannot wait to see this undoubtedly exhilarating vision in its entirety come July.

I mean, come on. Cameron, Rodriguez, and Holkenborg! It's gonna be awesome.",0.9627,237

Generally you shouldn't leave these important things to americans. Watch just about any anime with the american dub voices, and then with the original japanese + english subs (provided you don't understand japanese), it'll become abundantly clear: They can't recreate that unique expression, so it's best left to the japanese.
