"The  R&R Hall of Fame finally ""Shook it Up!"" with The Cars!(Miss you Benjamin Orr, thank you for singing one of the best songs and ""video"" of the 80's(Drive) I know you're up there with a smile on face), not only are The Cars on my personal list for ""Best band of the 80's"" but they are on my personal list for ""All time greatest bands"" as well, there will never be another voice in R&R like Ric Ocasek with the quirkiness of it. But I thought Bon Jovi was already in, well it's about time because they are on my ""Best bands of the 80's"" list as well, but like said, I thought they were already on the list years ago, if not, they should've been!. On PBS The Moody Blues performed a special concert for their album ""Days of Future Past"" and it was amazing with an orchestra and choir as they sang all their greatest hits, the way they did ""Nights in White Satin"" was amazing. I also loved how they finally recognized Nina Simone because they were always giving her a bad rap and not enough people realize how Sister Rosetta Tharpe was also a major influence in shaping music into what we call Rock & Roll along with Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and Little Richard......great list but I would've also liked to have seen Chaka Khan and Judas Priest(BREAKIN' THE LAW! BREAKIN' THE LAW!). And big props for the band that gave us hits like ""Sultans of Swing"", ""Skateaway"",""Romeo and Juliet"", ""So Far Away"", ""Brothers In Arms"" along with the so-called unofficial theme  for MTV(I'll let you guess the song!), and on another note Mark Knopfler is HANDS DOWN one of the best guitarists EVER, when I first heard him I didn't know they were British, because of the low key tone of his voice made me think he was southern because their music did kinda have a little hint of that blues-country sound.",0.9976,408

In all I think the Hall needs to get it together and be clear and TRANSPARENT on it's mission. If it is defined as an American institution only I think it simply will become an obsolete institution over time. However, whatever mission the Hall decides, it must PUBLICIZE it and including the nomination process and who, exactly, is involved and how decisions are made.

Tupac Shakur was not even rock and roll music!  He was complete and total non-talented shit!  He even sampled ""The Way It Is"" by Bruce Hornsby which is absolutely the most pathetic thing rap artists can even conceive of doing!  The Cars should have been inducted MANY years ago!  They deserve that!  Ric Ocasek is a true talented songwriter!  Tupac Shakur was shit!  He did not deserve being inducted before The Cars!  He was a horrible excuse for a recording artist!  He couldn't write his own music, so he had to sample music from REAL recording artists!
