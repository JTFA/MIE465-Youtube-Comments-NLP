I grew up in the town where it's been created in Bordeaux and I am so proud of thr success of thr brand. The mint in footcreams are in general for the refreshing feel and also it's antibacterial. You should try the wonderful footcream from L'Occitane if you haven't tried it already, thr cream is so rich so you might really love it and it smells of thr most wonderul lavender scent.... xxxx Sandra",0.9895,109
"Hey Fleur,
Love the haul, especially the Diptyque Christmas candle (I have the unicorn - so good!).
I think the minty foot cream is born of peppermint’s odour neutralising properties/freshness.

"Hi Fleur, I think the Neutrogena face wipes you mean are from the 'Hydro Boost' range which is packaged in blue - they do sell them in supermarkets like Sainsburys and Tesco - for some reason some Superdrug and Boots don't sell them in the store, but you can order them online now at Boots as they are on offer at £3.33 instead of £4.99 - and either collect them from store or have them delivered?

"I love Ouai! For the wave spray I find it works best on dry hair or damp hair that you are letting air dry. I don't like it if I blow dry my hair with it in, I find it gets tacky. I have that problem with wave/sea salt sprays from different brands as well. And as for the treatment masque it is soooo highly concentrated the amount in the packet is more than enough for your hair. My hair is the same length and thickness as yours and one packet is all I need. You won't be disappointed. And as a side note, it smells AMAZING.",0.9333,119

"I really enjoy the pink wipes, those and the No7 wipes are the only ones that don't seem to make me break out or aggravate it further if I have broken out....but the pink wipes are gnarly on the eyes so I use the garnier micellar oil water that you use to take all my makeup off then go in again with the pink wipes to get rid of any residue.

Also mint is a really good ingredient for cutting through grease, oils and sweat and of course bad odor. I expect the latter two are reason behind foot products smelling of mint as feet produce similar bacteria to that used in the cheese making process, only a very strong citrus, mint or such like scents are the only solutions powerful enough to not only disguise the smell but eliminate the sweat that produces said bacteria ❤",0.4955,155

"I work in Lush and I know we have a minty foot cream because peppermint is supposed to stimulate red blood cells to the area to help repair the area faster if it's sore, and to give it a refreshing, cooling feeling thanks to its natural menthol that also feels great if your feet are very swollen.

"They use mint to scent foot cream to deodorize stinky feet👣👣💞💕. PS, love the star jumper💖💖💫💫xxx",0.4019,27
They usually put mint in the foot cream because it has a cooling effect (try popping it in the fridge) and it really helps against the heavy feeling you can have in your feet and ankles :),0.7501,39

"This is a bit odd, but I would love to hear your thoughts on the soap and glory foot cream. With the weather heating up here in Australia I would like my feet to look a bit nicer!! 😄👣",0.9617,44
Tip- and you’ll find it when you’re a Mum- the basic beauty cotton wool pads are cheaper than the big baby “soft” ones. Anything in the “baby” aisle in boots is SO expensive compared to likewise products. Xx,0.5859,50
To soothe tired/achy feet. Also to combat any stinky foot odor... I believe.,-0.34,18
"Totally with you on the face wipe topic! I personally couldn’t live without them. Also if you love the sanctuary spa line you should try their foot cream, I think it’s called heel repair balm or something like that and it is AMAZING! Xx",0.9156,52
Totally! And def get the essie colour- I'm so obsessed with it! xo,-0.4263,16
Try Gold Bond healing foot cream.  I have the driest feet known to man and this is really moisturizing.  Even my pedicurist noticed that my heels looked better.  And no mint.  You look great!,0.7263,39
"Try using a quarter cup of Listerine mouth wash, a quarter cup apple cider vinegar and 2 cups of warm water. Soak your feet in it for 15 or 20 minutes and your dry skin will come right off! I do this regularly for my dry, cracked feet and have amazing results.",0.7177,57

You mentioned having dry nails. Mine use to be so dry they were always splitting and de-laminating. The best thing I found for dry nails is the Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail and Cuticle Oil. I put a little on every day and it sorted the problem. Now I just have to put it on every now and again. Worked wonders!,0.6114,67
You should be thankful that a company thinks of its client enough to portion out the mask so you don't over use and therefor have to repurchase more than needed especially if it is a more expensive brand. They are just letting you know that you don't need any more than what is right here in this sachet. I think it's great that they do that. How many companies think of the client before the bottom line. Just a different way of thinking about it. Have a lovely day!!!,0.9257,97
You should try Flexitol Heel Balm visible results in one day. It works really well and it has no scent.,0.0498,22
You should try neutrogena face wipe the hydrating one. I think you would like it. I haven’t been able to find that specific garnier micelar water where i live :/,0.0258,34

omg I love the Caudalie shower gel! My auntie got it for me for xmas 2 years ago and I have never used another one since. All other ones just smell so artificial compared to it. I had never been to SpaceNK before then so she has got me addicted and gave me the fragrance last year for xmas and I have not used any other fragrance since either!  Literally today picked up my order from SpaceNK with three bottles of the shower gel and a new fragrance bottle. So glad you are loving it too - I am addicted!! xxx,0.9268,108
"syvkni Yeah, my problem is also the waste. I don't want to be sending hundreds of wipes to the rubbish tip every year. I prefer a balm cleanser with a flannel. Just as quick and easy.",-0.1586,41

"the main reason I see why most foot care products are minty is because the menthol in the product is cooling on the feet, which is an extra layer of relief for those who are on their feet all day. Upshot (or downshot) of that is that one's feet smell like toothpaste. :P",0.8959,58
the use of menthol/mint is to get rid of stinky feet but also to increase circulation to your feet which helps to keep them soft and smooth!,0.7088,30
the wipes your looking for are water boost they are amazing. Tesco has them for 2quid just now x,0.7579,20
"those neutrogena wipes are so deceiving! They say in very small print on the back ""don't use near eyes"" but what are you going to do if you can't use the wipe to take off eye makeup? I was so excited about those wipes and I had the same reaction, stick to the 'makeup remover' wipes from neutrogena to take eye makeup off or you'll burn your eyeballs lol.",0.7969,77
