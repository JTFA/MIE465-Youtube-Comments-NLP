"""Miss You""

Took time to get you
Took time to let you know
Tried to forget you
You're unforgettable

There's 24 hours in a day
I think about you more than 24 times
Just trying not to think about you
But you've been on my mind
I got nothing for you but time
'Cause you always end up by my side
Through loving you, I needed time
I needed time, and now I'm like

Can I hit it like that?
Like this, like that?
Uh-huh, you know
Can I kiss it like that?
Like this, like that?
Remember that
Heaven, it feels like that
I won't lie to you, no, no
Can I hit it like that?
I've been waiting

For you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you
I've been waiting on and on and-

Took time to find you
You left to go away
Must I remind you, feelings don't go astray, no

There's 24 hours in a day
I think about you more than 24 times
Just trying not to think about you
But you've been on my mind
I got nothing for you but time

For you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you
I've been waiting

Oh yes, it's true, true, true, true
I can be different for you, you, you, you
Show me the things I gotta do, do, do, do
I will be different for you, you, you, you
You, woah",0.9983,374
