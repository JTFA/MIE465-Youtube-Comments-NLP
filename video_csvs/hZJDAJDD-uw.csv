"I bought 2 flat disk Amplified antennas for under $20 a piece. I used velcro tape and place them high up on my windows. The windows that are facing the tv towers, the city. I bring over 20-something channels. Went to Best Buy and bought two Insignia, Roku TVs. From Best Buy. Less than 150 dollars a piece Not necessarily a smart TV I just wanted Ruku.(ruku is the way to go). No camera or microphone built into the TV!!... you don't want or need internet TV that is fed by a cable provider your smartphone will take over that role without having an internet TV, but you'll be in charge.. in other words your smartphone is the provider.. I subscribed to Netflix and Hulu but I may drop Hulu though.. and through T-Mobile's binge on which offers many many streaming services that does not hit your data. I watch the heck out of Netflix, Hulu YouTube. Sometimes I rent movies from the Google Play and these are only mentioning a few. With binge on they all come in at 480p which is More then fine for me. Also I've had the G3 to G4 now the V 30 and they all hot spotted my computer. And it is pretty damn fast .And for that I pay a little extra for a lot of extra gigs. It was all a little confusing at first but now since I got used to it I realize it is pretty easy. No Verizon no Comcast no cable bill don't need it. Yes old habits are hard to break but we live in a different world now I'm glad I'm a cable cutter. And being 60 yrs young. Im not set in my ways any more.  My phone runs my printers. My all in ones and now T-Mobile is going to offer this I'm on board. Cable companies are fighting back but it's a losing battle.
