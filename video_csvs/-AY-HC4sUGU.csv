"margins for orbital class space planes are nothing like engineering margins for aircraft. It's like comparing a formula car to a tractor. well, not exactly, but you get the idea. nothing inherently wrong with the plane, and just routine checks along the way in the flight test process, for safety.  at any rate, the shuttle was actually called the orbiter.  The complete system was called the space shuttle.  It was inherently flawed due to the system architecture, due to the fact that pieces of foam insulation from the main tank could impact the leading edges of the wing. also the material sciences available when the thing was designed. The heat shields were never re-designed, and all of those problems were actually solved by the Venture Star, even the tank issues, just a few months after it was cancelled. If anyone is to blame for the orbiter's failure, and the fact that it had no replacement, it's the idiots in government, that tell the engineers how to build a spaceship, and then cancel it after spending tons of tax payer money to develop it, leaving the engineers to pick up the pieces and find other applications for the technology.   they call it NASA.",-0.8683,227

piekielrl I'd expect that there needs to be a little give. They probably have serious materials inside that load bearing section anyway. Most likely when it is loaded the weight of the payload will keep stresses on either side in one primary direction which has been anticipated by wind studies. Once the payload is dropped the section is likely much stronger than the forces exerted from that point on.,-0.1779,73

"using just my head and no computational diagnostics I would imagine that it would be advisable to join the tails, there would be significant twisting upon launch under any kind of cross wind never mind the forces exerted upon the single joining wing under normal use, who the hell designed this? Was it the same team that designed the Virgin F1 car? Computational fluid dynamics are very well and good but as Richard knows to his eventual cost in F1, what the computer tells you and what actually happens in real life are two totally different things.
I remember someone once saying that you can tell a lot from an aircraft by its looks, if she looks like she wants to fly, she will. This thing looks like somebody pressed save half way through the design process. 
It will I am sure fly, but I would be reluctant to say she will last more than a few flights before she breaks up mid air.",0.9265,176
