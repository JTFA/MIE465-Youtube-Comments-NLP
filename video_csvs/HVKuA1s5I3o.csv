"First I would like to say that i'm not here to condemn anyone. 
Why are we divided? Sorry to be the one to point out the elephant in the room but the reason the world is divided is because of ""sin"" Christian artists today are trying to save the world without the one who came to save the world. This song is dumb because in the end there will be division. The wheat and the tares. Once someone is truly born again all racism goes away. Why do I say this is dumb. It's because they know the antidote that the world needs to solve the problem but they aren't preaching it to the world they're trying to do it another way.  The problem is that in churches today you get a watered down gospel that doesn't really save people. I found God when I left church and ever since I did my life hasn't been the same. I was a porn addict, I did drugs, I went to clubs and parties to get wasted, I was addicted to sports, video games, movies, music, tv shows, social media and everything out there that keeps us away from God. After I cried out to God for forgiveness He changed me. Now when I go to church it seems like all they talk about is the things of the world like sports, tv shows, movies and they even play Justin bieber, imagine dragan and drake inside the church like it's nothing. Look when you are born again everything changes you now have the power of God in you to overcome sin. But no you won't hear that in most churches. People will say there is nothing wrong with the list of things I listed above but when that is what takes up most of your day it has become an idol. These are the last days so there is going to be division because no one wants to call sin out for what it is and people today in churches seem to think it's ok to still sin over and over again once you've been saved. You might mess up once in a while but you won't keep going back to the same sin everyday. So are you born again or have you been fed a lie? We all need to repent and actually take God serious and stop playing games. Remember the parable of the seed and the different grounds it feel on. They all heard the word and believed but only 25% that heard and believed were saved the others fell away. Remember the 10 virgins? They were all waiting for the bridegroom but only five were ready when he came. Remember the servant who was waiting on his lord to return but said that He was taking to long and decided to start drinking with the drunkards? 

Luke 12
 45But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; 46The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

1 John 3
7 Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.
8 He that committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.
9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for His seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

1 Corinthians 6
9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
11 And such WERE some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
 
Hebrews 10
26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?..

2 peter 2
20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

 

2 Thessalonians 2
2 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,
2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

 2 Timothy 3 
3 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.


We are living in the time of the falling away. I hope this was helpful to someone because Jesus is coming very soon.",-0.9899,1260

"I am not at all a fan of rap music or Kirk Franklin.  However, what he said in the beginning was very powerful and very true.  Satan will use any tool in his toolbox to try to divide us.

How you succumb to the earthly world of politicians and cowboy presidents is beyond me. Love your neighbor and it doesn't matter the color of their skin or even if they are believers. You can make believers of the non-believers.
You cannot do that when you yourself creates the divide. No matter what anyone else does, the judgement be upon you because we all kneel before the One true God who put his son on the cross for your negligence and my own. He didn't ask the thief what he stole, he simply said repent and do good to others. Be a light in someone's life and band together to show His love and mercy...anything else is your personal ego which there is no room for(tower of Babel)",0.9701,189

"This is one the most ignorant, stupid ""Christian"" songs ever produced based on that ""are you left, are you right"" line.  That is ignorance claiming ""Left"" and ""Right"" are morally equivalent.  THEY ARE NOT. 

""Left"" means Liberalism, Leftists which is the tyranny of MARXISM, SOCIALISM and COMMUNISM, morally bankrupt lies of political correctness, all of which are INHERENTLY bad and wrong and is in no way moral equivalent to ""right"" which is ""Democracy"" and our government, ""Constitutional Republic"".  One is INALIENABLE rights giving to us by GOD, which is the ""Right"", Conservative ideology and the other, Leftists, is a explicit denial of God, Marxism, Socialism and Communism.  If Mandisa and Toby don't know that, she, Toby, and people who think like this ARE the problem and it NEEDS to be pointed out, needs to be rightfully POINTED at and rightfully condemned.",-0.9614,182
