"LYRICS:

Choking on the air, i breathe 
Working hard for the moolah
It''s coming like tsunami 
It''s gonna get you whatever 
Shake them shackles, they can't break free
That worth getting, don't come for free 
Here's love and unity 
We are in this together 


Voices telling you, chasing at your ear
Voices trying to fill you up with fear
Hit'me everywhere, hit'em everywhere, hit'em everywhere
And no matter what the people say



And no matter what the people say



When it gets hard, we go harder
When they rise up, we rise stronger
Hey, yeah I'm gonna live my life my way
No matter what the people say
No matter what the people say
No matter what the people say


Choking on the air, i breathe 
Working hard for the moolah
It''s coming like tsunami 
It''s gonna get you whatever 
Shake them shackles, they can't break free
That worth getting, don't come for free 
Here's love and unity 
We are in this together 


Voices telling you, chasing at your ear
Voices trying to fill you up whith fear
Hit'em everywhere, hit'em everywhere, hit'em everywhere
No matter what the people say


And no matter what the people say



No matter what the people say 
No matter what the people say
No matter what the people say",-0.9675,231
