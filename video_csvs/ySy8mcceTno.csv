But this, this looks like a fanmade movie based off a FanFiction a 13 yr old just getting into to writing produced late one night after watching to many let's plays.",-0.2942,88

So is slender man finally getting a movie I hope it's really good and I hope they don't cancel it like they did with the other one but then agin the other one looked poop,0.5875,35
"So let's see. 
Sony planned a Pop Eye Movie.
The trailer got popular and everyone loved it.
They then got an idea to make an Emoji movie to be ""hip and cool with the kids"" (emojis stopped being popular long before the idea) they cancelled Pop Eye then the Emoji Movie has Candy Crush in it. Another shitty game and is outdated.
Now they are making a Slenderman movie. Movies based on real life video games tend to suck. Slenderman hasn't been popular since like 2012. Two girls killed someone in the name of Slenderman. So what's next? Some other outdated trend? What, in 2025 will we have a movie based on that shitty knuckles meme? Let's see what also is outdated and bad *googling* oh so uhh what. 2019, would they end up making an Undertale movie? I hope not, that game has a bad enough fanbase like Fnaf, which Fnaf is still alive today somehow. Seriously, can we just end the cancer?",-0.8767,191

"The movie would've DEFINITELY benefitted more if they made/released it when they originally planned to; at the peak of Slender/slenderman's popularity. I personally think it's a bit distasteful to do it now, considering what those two girls did (even . though that was awhile ago, wasn't one of them sentenced last fall or something?) Plus, the fact that it doesnt really look like how Slender (or the creepypasta) was originally portrayed is another downside.
