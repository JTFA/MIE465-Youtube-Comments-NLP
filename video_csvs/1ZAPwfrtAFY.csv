You see,  it is RACIST to let the British People know what the Arabs are doing to their defenseless young girls,  because you might be considered a racist for carrying about white children.  British white girls are being groomed into sex slavery,  raped,  beaten,  sold for sex and even killed.  One girl was being molested when she was only 13 years of age,  and her 40 year old boyfriend got jealous of her as she grew older and burned her alive.   But the British Media is not allowed to talk about this,  because that would be racist.   When ever you hear that someone is anti-racist,  this will always be code words for being anti-white.

"Hello Americans.
I am italian and I am here to show you my appreciation for this message from the brilliant John Oliver.
The three techniques of mass-distraction that Trump is using right now with you are well known in my country and they have been (and still are being) used for decades. You can see the results now. Our country is degenerating year after year in an endless crisis, basically because people has somehow assimilated this way of non-thinking. We have lost our capability to use our critical sense, turning every debate into a pointless bout on ""who or what is worse then who or what we believe in"". Debating is not about what is better anymore, it is about what is worse, because what is worse makes our opinion better than it and, consequently, completely legitimate.

THIS IS THE WORST ENEMY OF DEMOCRACY. So don't let this warning from John Oliver be unheard.

Greetings from Italy.",-0.9188,177

I will say this, I would prefer if the Armed Forces took power and placed a Fleet Admiral as the 'temporary Consul of the Republic of the U.S.A.' while a reformation of how our Democracy works, is hashed out. One thing in particular; Politicians need to remember that they are Civil Servants, that they are fulfilling a Civic duty, which is both an Honor and a burden to be born with a sense of duty. And to remember the price of failing the People ( think the Phoenicians had an interesting way in dealing with Generals who lost/failed the People ) I know, that shit would NEVER work, but I think it beats all the corruption that we do have.
