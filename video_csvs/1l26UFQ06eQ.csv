Because they don't need to. Their actions SHOW that they are 'not the men' being discussed.

Generally the guys saying 'not all men' are the ones that I don't trust, because the second a woman tries to talk about something difficult that's happened to them these guys immediately try to make the conversation about them and how great they are.

This message is not coming after all men, it's only coming after predators, rapists, and molesters. The women are talking about their experiences with creepy dudes, not with all dudes. But when you assume this means you (which if you're not a predators why would you be) and defend and argue against the message it sounds like you're _defending_ said rapists, predators, and molesters. 

So men, we understand men go through this too and we want to talk about that too, but this message right now is specifically to help out women and literally all we want is for you to say ""Yeah, women shouldn't have to put up with that, I don't do that stuff and other guys shouldn't either."" You get to tell everyone what a great guy you are and that you're not part of that group, while still being supportive of women. 

We both need each other to survive so either men or women having the belief that they hate ALL other women or men is ridiculous. You literally can't live like that, you're gonna have to deal with the opposite sex at many points in your life so you have to learn that you're BOTH THE SAME.
