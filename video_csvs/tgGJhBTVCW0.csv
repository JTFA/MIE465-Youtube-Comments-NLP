"I tried this far longer than just one week and you can't really judge a diet by merely following it for one week. I lived just like this almost half a year and I can assure you that it won't benefit your health in the long-term. It might be a good fasting or detoxing idea for a few weeks but not a sustainable lifestyle for your whole life. Way too much fruit will make you super hyper and you won't feel in balance. Too much fruit might even make you gain weight. Look at Fullyraw Kristina or that one girl that Freelee wanted to live like that and wanted to make her lose weight by this lifestyle...this girl gained weight and ended up eating disordered. Even Freelee herself stopped making high carb videos and now makes ""minimalism"" videos because it seems that's the new L.A. trend. Don't get me wrong: A clean vegan diet with lots of vegetables, leafy greens and some fruit is awesome and the more raw the better but merely eating fruits is not healthy in the long term...especially not if you don't live in a country with a warm climate. It might even work in some hot asian countries or in L.A. or Texas for a longer time. I live in northern Europe and eating lots of expensive tropical fruits is certainly not ecological or sustainable!",0.9882,254

It is like icecream, it doesn't fill me up. Also there are some things you can't get from a raw vegan diet, such as b12. I just urge people who are raw vegan to give one tiny concession and take b12 supplements. You could just go to the store and start taking them, there is no such thing as overdosing on b12 since your body just stores it. Going blind isn't worth being ""pure"" and lack of b12 is what causes a lot of vegans, let alone raw vegans, to give up the lifestyle.

Or that you’re not doing very good on the diet and are considering quitting or adding some cooked foods. You then feel like a failure from the shame.
