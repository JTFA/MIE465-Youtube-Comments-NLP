I thought at first this was some prankster trailer but while watching the trailer I was getting excited to see the two main original actor/characters Daniel & johnny and suddenly I thought this was the real thing and thought WOW !!!!!!!!! but at the end of the clip I see 'You Tube Red series' ??  So come to find out this will be a 10 half hour series on an internet subscription TV channel and thought WHY !!!! show a sequel featuring the original actors of a big time 80's movie which basically everybody loved and grew up with on some internet subscription platform ??  WHY not as a feature film ??  Surely this would attract such a large audience on the big screen as well as DVD sales and on TV & internet subscription channels and I'm sure very rare time big cinema screen watchers like myself who grew up in the 80's would no doubt go to watch this on the BIG SCREEN !!!!!!  Sad to say but what a lame decision to make and actually I think this will do an injustice to the original Karate Kid saga.  Do we really think these Hollywood film companies are short of a few bucks to come out with a good script and a production team to give this sequel the credit it deserves featuring the original cast actors.,0.9872,248
I thought this was fan made till I saw Daniel and Johnny.. now I‚Äôm Fucken stoked!!!!,0.5374,22
"I watched both trailers multiple times. Hungry for more. Looks like there's a student who switches sides.
