"17years now, since i lost my love, yeah i know life have no meaning without your love, everything become pointless, no direction, everyone lost their love one would know what i mean...

I know sometime you may force yourself to feel the pain, because that's the only thing that could linger and not letting go...only time can make you to slowly forget the pain, until you feel the numbness again, and appreciate for what your love have gave you.

Think about the good way, at least which made you a reasonable and supportive person who know the other's pain, and you are lucky enough to understand love in your life time, some people don't even experience love in their life until the very last second, so at least we can appreciate it.....

I know it take time to settle, counting on years, after it settle, try go get your happiness, drag your soul even if you don't have strength for it, because that's the only way to live better and have a chance to get support from the others.",0.9808,202

Either way, anything can happen which is what drives me so crazy about all of this. Life is so precious. And I am so so so saddened that this happened to you. He is resting in peace. Believe in that. I can see your pain. It hurts to see you hurt. Trust in your emotions and grieve though, for as long and as hard as you want.

"Hello, I'm Jennifer from Belgium. 
The first time I discovered your channel was when you uploaded the video about your boyfriend who passed away :(
Since then I subscribed to your channel and I follow your posts whenever I can. 
I just wanted to say that I think about you (even when I'm not on Youtube) and even though we don't know each other and never met, I can feel that there's something about you which is so special. You are very strong. I cried during your videos. 
I wish I could hug you!
English is not my native language so I'm sorry for the bad grammar, but I wish you so much luck in your life!
Trust me, eventually you will learn to be happy again. I understand that this is such a hard time for you, you spent so many years with Ryan. Take your time and don't feel forced to upload videos on youtube on a regular basis. Take time for yourself and only upload when you feel the need to.

"Hey, I just wanted to say you are sooooo beautiful. Even from the first video I could tell that you have cried a lot just by looking into your eyes. I can't even imagine how hard it is to loose someone like that.. Ignore all negativity. It is not a reality show. I would not want to see a video of a girl crying, Ryan would not want that either. I think it is disrespectful towards myself to cry in public. You handle this great. I believe you are in the right path and that you rock! Grieving a break up can not even measure up to death. You loose them but they are still there, you get news that they are okay, they are happy. It is not knowing where they are and how they are doing. It was not your choice to end this. I really hope it will get better for you. You seem the sweetest girl on earth. I wish I could jump into the screen and give you the biggest hug. If you ever stop by Athens Greece I have a hug for you. Best wishes! Sonia",0.9816,214

I haven‚Äôt really accepted what has happened yet and don‚Äôt know when I will, I get upset but I‚Äôm still quite numb and in denial that it has happened which is why I think I‚Äôm not fully grieving yet. My family keep telling me I should get counselling but with not accepting everything yet, I don‚Äôt think it would help. I don‚Äôt really know what to do to start accepting it because I‚Äôm just kind of going with the flow and living each day knowing he is gone but not wanting to believe it.

Although you are still grieving, I can see your personal development in character. Your thoughts are much more concise, you have gained a greater translation for what you are feeling at the moment than what you did three and a half months ago, and you are getting stronger as time passes. It's very noble of you to have know that you have your wants but also empathize with the position he could have been in if he was to suffer. That alone takes a great amount of recognition. It's truly AMAZING that you have the relationship and support that you do with his family and close friends; I honestly cannot tell you how to feel but only suggest that you continue to develop those personal relationships and celebrate the positive points as they arise. I hope that at some point with time you all will be able to remain at peace with this unfortunate chapter in life.

I truly feel sorry and saddened from listening to your story and know that what I feel after hearing your story is probably less than a fraction of what you are feeling.

"The best thing about seeing this video AFTER your last video is that in this video you talk about not really having goals, plans, things you want to do and now seeing that you do want to travel and you do have goals and aims in your life, big and small. It‚Äôs lovely to see. It‚Äôs so important to have those things for yourself. 

For the motivation mondays thing (an idea I love) maybe you could test out things like gratitude journaling, bullet journaling, certain apps etc that people recommend for helping with motivation etc for a week or more and sort of roadtest them for your viewers? Its be a cool thing to watch as well as maybe useful to you to try things out that might help you achieve your goals.",0.9876,149

"This comment is a bit late, but better late than never I suppose. I watched your first video about this, and first I want to tell you how sorry I am for your loss. I lost my best friend my freshman year of college, so at the time (6 years ago now) I was similar in age. It was the most difficult thing I have ever gone through. Every birthday it feels unfair that she is frozen in time and my life is ever changing. I don't know exactly what you're going through. I don't think anyone truly does, and everyone has their own way of grieving. I just want you to know that it might not feel like it now, but in time you will begin to heal and have a different perspective. It took me a very long time to come to terms with losing my best friend, and sometimes I still think of her, but the difference between now and when I was 18 is that I don't feel that same pain any longer. I look back on it and think fondly of her, I feel thankful for the memories we made together and proud that I had the strength to get through it. It made me a stronger and more resilient person. There is SO much more in store for you. I wish you the very best in this difficult time of your life. Thanks for sharing something so personal <3",0.989,268

For a long time I couldn't comprehend what had happened and I refused to accept he was gone. I still think of him every single day and miss him.
