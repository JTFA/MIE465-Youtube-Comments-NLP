A squib is not a tiny explosive. A squib is the name for what happens when a bullet is fired but it gets stuck in the barrel of the gun. Brandon lee was killed by one. The prop team fucked up the dummy rounds and one with just a primer went off lodging a bullet in the barrel. When full power blanks were loaded for the next scene the bullet was fired from the barrel and it hit Brandon. Please do more research before you make these vids,-0.9756,93

i know someone who had a blank gun the barrel was partially blocked so a small charge could only be released upwards instead of forwards.i thought all guns were like that in hollywood.so when brandon lee was shot & killed filming the crow i thought foul play was involved.who was the actor that was shot & killed ??? you should name him out of respect. i always thought them old films from the 30s  40s & 50s the actors took crazy risks when i watch spartacus with kirk douglas which was made in the 60s the rolling logs set on fire looked  really dangerous.it made the film look real i watched it again recently its a great film.i do remember people like harold lloyd buster keaton & charlie chaplain some of the stunts they did were extremely dangerous.great post it shows how much actors back in the day put themselves at risk to make the films more realistic happy new year hope its a good one..,0.5296,174
"i love how you emphasized ""an actor got f*&%ing killed!"" at just the right moment! and while it does help the realism when actors get shot at,for christ sakes, its basically JUST a job,they dont deserve to die!you wouldnt ask a banking manager to stop a robbery by fighting the thief,so why do actors deserve to RISK their lives? it is cool when the actor decides to do his own stunts though,THAT is what makes an awesome actor. and kudos to the actors guild for protecting the actors! actors are entertainers, NOT SOLDIERS!",0.9222,117
