"""I am your father"" is when I gave up on star wars
First movie (1977) was fine. Okay it's a space movie and kind of fun to watch.
Next movie (1980) they turned it into a soap opera with ""he's your dad"" and then ""she's your sister"" just ruined it. 
It went from a fun film to a soap opera where the movie's creator is just leeching money off of people
