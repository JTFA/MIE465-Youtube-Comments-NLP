"iPhone 6 was Apple's first big phone. when iPhone 6s came out they changed Aluminum 6000 to7000. I fix laptops and cell phones as the side job while I go to colleges. most iPhone is not bent, but if it is slightly bent, it's 6.   

iMac GPU - Nvidia and AMD chipset ran very hot back in the day. When Nvidia and AMD release GPU, they also release Reference design. It's a guide telling manufacturers to cool the GPU in certain ways so it does not overheat.  Because of Apple has the cutting-edge design, and often constrained by space, the GPU and CPU in older iMac were cooled by one fan which was control by Mac OS. It's Apple-designed board and thermal control. the fault lies with Apple.  On top of that MCM style, GPU was never sold to the public. you can't find replacement GPU.

 ""Intel and Apple engineers know more about how to cool the products they design and build than some random off the internet.""   Off the internet?? most GPU manufacturers like EVGA, MSI, ASUS use Nvidia and Amd's ref design and often go overboard with extra cooling fans, thermal pads on memory and heatsink. Not only that the GPU is mounted horizontally.  iMac Pro's soldered in GPU, and uses their own design.   I seen the inside of new iMac pro and I'm glad they spend a lot of space on Cooling fan but if you compare to any box looking PC cooling... it has less airflow | heat sink | Fans (by a lot ) . Will they able to pull it off? I hope so. GPU and CPU are getting more energy efficient and perhaps there will not be a recall. 

""Apple engineers know more about how to cool the products ""  Just search Macbook thermal Throttling. lolz, Even my 2015 MBPr had some issue so I opened it up and reapply thermal paste.  The pursuit of thinness has trade-off and the price you pay is performance and cooling.  only people who should buy this expensive imac are video editing pros. nothing is more taxing than heavy computation they use to render and etc. the heat generated need to be moved out or there will be 1. thermal throttling or 2. hardware problem. 

All I'm saying is this. Just wait a year. see how things pan out. Do you like 6? wait and get 6s. Do you like Macbook air? ( the first one was overpriced) wait couple generations. Do like like this shiny new iMac Pro? wait a year.  If there is no problem with this one you might get it cheaper. if there is a problem, you can by the improved version.",0.9913,507
