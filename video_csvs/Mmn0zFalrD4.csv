"Don't most solid punches work better (cut more cleanly) when the bevel is on the inside edge, not on the outside? The problem with an internal bevel is the core of whatever material you cut becomes compressed and friction-wedged inside INCREDIBLY tightly. If you're punching metal, you'd probably have to turn the core out on the lathe (actually cut it) rather than just drill it! Your Mega-Punch 5,000,000 is a great idea, by the way.

"This was a really nice idea! 
But it will work even better (cleaner hole) if you change your cutting edge so that the angled part of it is pointing inward, and not outward like it does now. Because when you have like it is now, the tool first cut the hole, then expand it slightly (due to the thickness of the pipe) - and that expansion causes things things to break apart or deform (unless they are made out of very soft flexible material). 
If the angled part of the cutting edge is pointing toward the center of the pipe, the middle part will be crushed instead - wich doesn't matter, since you are going to drill that out anyway, haha. This is easely fixed on the lathe.",0.5528,145
