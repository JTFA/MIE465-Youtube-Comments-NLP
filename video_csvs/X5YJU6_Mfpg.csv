I just graduated from the same college and it’s blowing my mind. I even had a class with your brother once. It’s also really cool to see how you’ve grown and used the skills you learned from then to become who you are now. You’ve done an amazing job with the vlogs and I’m excited to see where you go next :) This video was done very well. It gave me the pieces of footage I wanted to see with some meaningful story laid over and I liked it a lot. I think it might also be fun to include a small clip of young julien at the end.,0.9665,125

"I loved this. I rarely comment on here but watch every week. I used to study photography but got away from it when I started nursing school. On a day I was completely over whelmed and stressed my brother brought my film camera from storage and put it in my hand and was like ""You need to take photos again."" We then spent the evening looking through my old work and feeling that urge to get back to what once made me happy. It was an emotional feeling to see something I loved so much and realized that I have stopped that in order to provide for myself. I hope to find the time to get back to that feeling that I see you have with your videos. This inspired me to take time for myself and do things I love. I hope you take time to do the same, and I hope you continue to make more videos like this.",0.9936,173

I feel like a different person, I look like a different person, and at times I feel lost because I am no longer pursuing what I pursued in college (BA psychology and criminal justice). It’s neat to see you reflecting as well, makes me think a lot of people our age may feel the same way.",0.296,103
"I remember when I first really started watching you one of your videos you talked about how you worked in a radio station and It was you talking about that experience that made me realise I want to do the same.

Why am I so obsessed with your hair?  Ahhh, because I want you to be my impression of who you are/represent in my life and the long hair does not reconcile with that concept of you.  I mean, I'm not mad at you for looking young, so really, I kind of talked myself out of really hating it, I mean you had to go through that to get here, I can't begrudge the process.  I think this was really good for us.  Thank you for sharing.  And yes, I realize this is an entirely one-sided ""us"", but you're Peach's daddy, so yous good people.   You've come a long way baby.  And if you don't know what that's from, you're too young!",0.8162,182
"I've never commented on a video before but after watching this I felt compelled to. I'm currently pursuing a career in production and I have had the rockiest and roughest start, but when you said something about developing a skill set to become a professional and using that to pursue something bigger, that hit home. Keep doing what you're doing because your and Jenna's channels are my favorite!",0.68,73

"It's really cool to see fetus Julien in a suit and tie interviewing people!!! I love seeing where people came from, or what choices led them to where they are now. 

I think it's important for people to know that success doesn't happen overnight, and there are long hours of dedication that go into anything someone does for a living. I feel like people look at youtubers and think they are not qualified to be ""professionals"" at anything, and I think this video shows that you are passionate and hard working, and always have been.",0.9563,107

"Julien, I really enjoy and appreciate these vlogs where I can tell from the beginning it will be deeper  than usual. There is such a tone shift, it's calmer and more vulnerable. It reminds me that you do genuinely think and care about what you put into this world. As someone who gets a smile each time I watch, it's good to know that there is intention behind that. You have a fun everyday style but I definitely look forward to when you have these differently creative days.
Much appreciation, Mariah",0.969,100
"Julien, despite this video being very short, it really inspired me. Im a film student currently, working towards my AA in film production. My goal one day is to look back at all my projects and be grateful for what ive learned. Im still learning and i will continue to learn and hopwfully one day ill be as great at film as you :) Maybe not as great, but almost :p",0.8593,78

"Okay because you asked for feedback, here's a long-ass comment: I loved this! I thought it was very interesting and I like the way you shot it - the side angle looked like you were being interviewed which tied in well with the content you were talking about. It would have been neat to hear more of the audio from the old clips. I like that you're thinking of this as story telling rather than just ""here's some old clips of me"". I liked what you said about remembering what it was like to be learning a skill set. And I agree that your experience in that ""old school"" media format has probably helped you so much in what you're doing now. I've always thought you were so comfortable on camera and easy to watch (like you're not awkward and self conscious) and I bet this has a lot to do with it. I'd love to see more of this style although I don't know how far you can go with nostalgia alone. But you definitely have a flair for evoking emotion in your audience and that paired with your authenticity is a winning combo imo. You're so talented and I'm always excited to see what you come up with!",0.9944,228

"One thing I love about Julien is that he doesn't always look straight into the camera. When he does, it's like he's talking to a friend, not just doing things and narrating like some vloggers. I love how he is just funny and relaxed, not trying to make it seem like his life is so much better or more interesting than yours. So for that I thank you, Julien, and you probably will never see this, but you keep being you, because you are pretty good at it.",0.9761,99

I’m at uni now and sometimes it can be so scary when you think ‘why am I here?’, ‘what am I gonna take from all of this?’ And so it’s reassuring to see you talk about the way your experience in higher education has shaped you even though you’re not directly doing what you did at college, or you’re doing it through a new medium.

"This was really uplifting to hear Julien. In abt 6 months I'm gonna start college, and I have no idea what I want to do with my life, except for this vague idea of communicating and collaborating with other people. I did consider journalism for a time, but my parents said it would take me nowhere, so I've been looking for alternatives with little luck.... seeing this video, however, makes me realize that where people end up is never where they expect. And even if you didn't become a journalist, in a sense, your education wasn't wasted either; it was still a rly important experience. That's very comforting to me. Makes me feel like going to college is still worth it, even if I don't know why yet. So thank you Julien 💖",0.9533,150
