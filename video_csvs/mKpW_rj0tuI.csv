"Alissa, I was very surprised that you said you liked the formula for the Stunna lip paint. I tried it on in the store and it was very runny and smeared everywhere. While the color was cute, I couldn't talk myself into buying something that was so messy and could potentially ruin my clothes or get all over my teeth all day. Do you have any tips on how you are getting this lip paint to stay in place and not smear?",0.2644,88

I really loved this video. I am at very overwhelmed with a lot of the brands that are out there. I am definately going to try some the brands that you mentioned that I shy away from. I have larger lips as well so tend to not go for a lot of color. Fenty help me step out of my safe zone. Keep up with the goofiness! It makes your videos stand out from the rest and it make the whole idea of not taking yourself too seriously when it comes to makeup. Trial and error can be fun! Thank you for making 2017 fun and looking forward to 2018!,0.9514,119
