Noah!!!! Why can’t you say pieces properly?? It’s not PESHES. Ruined the song.,0.6227,24
"Noah, this song means so much to me that I don't have words. Last year was the worst year of my life, and when I heard you play this in concert I started to cry. It encompassed and explained the other side of the situation I was in far too well. I just want to wish you so much luck, and let you know that I really appreciate the little bit of clarity I got from your music. It came to me when I needed it most. This one hadn't even been publicly released at the time. This one and Catastrophize hit home.
I hope you will come back to Minneapolis soon! I will drop everything to be there (And you should listen to the guy who suggested CD's and not just spotify ;) Ill buy one)",0.6842,150

"Taking it slowly
I'm afraid to be lonely
Nobody told me
It's harder than I thought to tell the truth
It's gonna leave you in pieces
All alone with your demons
And I know that we need this
But I've been too afraid to follow through

[Chorus]
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

[Verse 2]
Don't know where the time went
Stuck in the wrong mindset
I let the rules bend
When I know that all along they're made to break
You got me searching for reasons
To keep me from leaving
And that I have trouble breathing
I give myself another chance to stay
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

[Bridge]
One day before you know it, you will see
All of the pain and all the harmony
You'll feel the stinging and you think of me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt

[Chorus]
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody",-0.9972,295
