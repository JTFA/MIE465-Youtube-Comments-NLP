"*Morgan Freeman voice*
I remeber my baking fail like it was yesterday...

It all started on Sunday the ?? of ????? at 4:23pm in my ol' Melbournian home. I was trying to copy a recipe for baked chorros (*my normal voice* sorry i don't know how to spell) i needed a pastry bag but I'm an Islander so i obviously didn't have one. Then I went to cheak if there were any zip-lock bags. Nope. None. Zinch. Zero. Oh. How am i supposed to pipe these chorros out? So guess what i used?




*a plastic bag*





*normal voice*
I mean, how dumb was i? I used one of those fruit bags which was even more dumb because they weren't strong enough to hold the batter. The batter flew everywhere and that's why i no pastry chef😂",-0.9518,166

". One time i had my friend help me bake we were making a chocolate mouse pie  i was finishing up the crust and she was making the filling i told her we needed 1 and 1/2 cup of sugar for the recipe. Now i know whats the sugar and whats salt tin from my unmarked canisters my friend didn't and she ended up adding salt instead of sugar. So here we are all excited after its done baking adding whip cream and decorating giving each other shoulder pats, we both took  bite immediately it tasted like straight up salt lmao i don't think she's tried baking since then lol",0.9719,113

"A friend asked me to make a hello kitty cake for her daughters birthday. We talked about flavour and color, and she told me that she is not into buttercream. So I said I could make Italian meringue buttercream and only use very litte of it. On the day I made it, the day before the birthday, I was in a hurry, so I started very late. I wanted to half my buttercream recipe but accidently doubled the amount of water for the meringue. As I tried to incorporate the butter everything became liquid. A Disaster! I tried to thicken it but without success. Since it was to late to buy new ingredients I had to tell my friend that there will be no cake😭 Lucky for me her daughter was only 2 years old at that time, so at least she was not upset.",-0.2175,160

"Baking fail? I made honeycomb earlier this year. The recipe said to work fast after adding in the powder then quickly transfer to a pre-lined tray. I tried to do it quickly but didn't expect it to erupt like a volcano as it was my first time making it. The honeycomb set the wise, spatula, pot and baking tray to the cutting board I was working on. Managed to get most of it in the fridge but cleaning up was not fun. Tasted great though. 

There was also that time when I was playing kitchen about 10 years ago when I was 6. I would put plastic bowls in the oven and on the stove (turned off) because I didn't want to drop and break a regular plate, or use the over trays because they were too heavy. I accidentally left a bowl in the oven. Let's just say we had to keep the oveb door open for a while after the time we used it post kitchen play",-0.1295,184

"Hey Nick : Just recently I hosted a luncheon for 50 ladies and decided to make all the desserts.. well , I don’t know what happened that day but totally everything I was doing did not work out .. going in the epic fail zone! 

first I tried making my usual buttercream in one huge go by mixing six butter sticks lol and 3kgs of icing sugar ... mixing mixing and I ended up more cream flying everywhere and then splitting the thing !!! ... then I decided to make a massive chocolate cake and I tested it it was ok .. that afternoon I came back from an outing and the cake cracked in 3 massive pieces ... I was like wtf! .. then my lemon cake rose. nicely but 10mins later, it caved in... I noticed that the centre was so uncooked! By then I started crying as all my exciting baking plans had failed big time !

"Hi, Nick
Another awesome video as usual. I always like all the macarons you made, all fun and yummy looking 

Anyways, one of my biggest baking fails was that one time I looked at one of your macaron recipes and thought why not I give it a shot since the method I use to make macarons are different as in I never make an Italian Meringue but the French Meringue so I thought to learn another method to make a meringue since I'm a culinary student at the moment, so why not? As I was making the sugar syrup while beating the egg whites, I was checking on the temperature of the sugar before adding it in. It turns out ok to me somehow because it's glossy there so I assume it's ok so I add it to the mix and mixed it up. The batter looks funny but I ended up piping it out anyways but it was kinda hard to pipe cos it's kinda..solid? I went ahead and bake it after letting it dry and next thing I know was that it turned into an almond cookie, not macarons xD I was a bit sad but hey, mistakes happens, the so called macarons still taste good though.",0.1385,225

That made a huge difference! If you do the buttercream the day before, the flavour gets stronger over time! Despite a couple visual issues, they turned out great. You have really taught me how to be a macaron 'pro' ! Thank you so much!

Following a recipe I found online, I wanted to make those hidden surprise cakes (the ones with a hidden image inside them as you cut the cake). I decided to make my first batch a swirl of 5 different colors. Baked beautifully and came out delicious. As I started to cut them into heart shapes with my cutter, the cake started to crumble off and break down. I ended up with deformed heart shaped cakes. I decided not to give up and persevere so I followed the next instructions which were to put the shapes in with cake batter and bake. My shapes were too big for my container and the batter was going to overflow. I decided that i was going to use a cardboard box to hold up my cake. The cardboard box did hold in the cake but it was too tall so it caught on fire in the microwave. Me and my friends ate cooked, somewhat cooked, not cooked at all cake.

So we bake the cake, level it, and cut it into four equal slices. As we were cutting the cake, it started to crumble and break so we tried to cover it up with icing.

So then I put the cake pan in the oven then turned it on. Then I turned the oven off because batter started to fall out of the cake pan. I tried to fix it and then I just left it alone, but I forgot to turn the oven back on. So the whole time I wondered why the cake wasn't cooking and why it kept dripping.

Honestly I thought they were god awful but my friends loved them?",0.9301,80
"My biggest baking fail: i was bored and decided to look up a recipe on how to make a funfetti mug cake. Instead of carefully reading the instructions and putting the mug cake in the microwave for 40 seconds, my mind thought it said 4 minutes. I walked away and came back to the fire alarm set off and the whole house full of smoke and a nice pitch black mug inside of the microwave. 😂",-0.7269,81
"My biggest baking fail: over-mixing the macron mixture and didn't let it set... I went well past the ribbon stage without really realizing it, baked it almost immediately, and I think the real point of it flopping so bad is that I used the icing sugar that had corn starch in it... really disappointing, so lesson learned.",-0.8856,64

"My worst baking fail happened recently... I wanted to bake a cake for a friend of my sister who just passed her driving test. I needed to bake two cakes, one normal and one dyed black. The normal one was already out of the oven and turned out to be perfect. The black batter seemed to be wonderful too. I poured it into a springform (I hope you know what this is — happens to be the most popular cake tin here in Germany) and turned to the oven. However the sides weren’t tight enough and the bottom slipped out and the whole black (!) batter spread over the kitchen floor. It was a mess 😂 
I didn’t make the batter a second time because I simply hadn’t enough ingredients anymore. Well long story short I finished the cake in a different way I planned but it turned out beautiful and my sisters friend was both surprised and happy 😁. (She said the cake was amazing and that she froze it (because they couldn’t eat it at once) so that they could enjoy it for longer 😌
Sometimes things that seem so worse at the moment aren’t that worse anymore looking back 😉",0.9668,230

"Oh boy. My biggest baking fail was a three stage catastrophe. First I used salted butter in the chocolate chip cookie base of my cheesecake. Second I used tub cream cheese instead of block because  I figured it would work just as well. And finally after everything was all done and over with, I FORGOT to bring it with me to my family reunion. All that work for naught as no one even got to see it",-0.8979,83
"Oh man! My biggest baking fail was not understanding yeast and how it works. When I was younger, I decided to bake some cinnamon rolls because I was tired of buying them. Tried activating the yeast and even though it didn't look quite like how the recipe said it should, I pushed forward and convinced myself that it would be fine!! Basically I ended up with a few stones that day. They were soooooo tough. The lesson I learned? If something don't look right, it ain't right, especially yeast!!",-0.7842,103

"Oh my god Nick, when you asked me that question I had a flashback.

It was around Christmas time when I was about 11 years old and spending time with my lovely Nan while my Mum went on a holiday. We ran out of bread, but had ingredients to make a loaf so we made one. Now this was our first time baking a bread, I remember the mixture was so hard and sticky that we kept adding flour to it. When it was baked my Nan tried to cut it, but the bread was so hard that it flew off the kitchen counter! We burst out laughing and soon we were in tears. 😭 My Nan was in fits that she threw the bread at the floor and it was so hard that it bounced back. “It’s a flipping brick!” Nan said. 😂 What a baking disaster!

God I miss her... she’s in heaven. I forever treasure this memory. Love you Nan. ❤️",0.8492,189
Oh my god. I love these recipes. I just wish i can afford all the ingredients and the tools to make this. It would be super awesome if i could make these macarons and the cupcakes also for my friends and family and co workers. These look so yummy I cant wait to see more! *Subscribed*,0.977,63

"Okay **chuckles**, so, I love this question. This baking fail turned out to be my most favorite dessert growing up. My mom, sister and I were making brownies just any other way you'd make brownies with a mix (this was the first time we were using this mix). When it was finally in the oven and ready to come out, I was expecting beautiful, perfect, and fluffy brownies that I could just gobble up and make people jealous XD. But, when I finally did take them out, it was the weirdest thing ever. It was like the Newtonian fluid of baking, you could say. It was a weird mixture, like a brittle, but at the same time, it was chewy, like a caramel or a softer version of tootsie rolls (it was fully cooked). I reluctantly put it in my mouth (I didn't want to waste it), and it was the best thing I ever tasted!! I loved it, and so did my sister. We decided to call it ""brownie disaster,"" kinda in honor of what happened. To this day, we still bake this ""brownie disaster"" and eat it as if it was a holy chocolate sludge. We even give it to our friends some of the times, and they like it too!",0.9874,258

"Omg my biggest baking fail was probably like when my mom was at work but needed cupcakes made so I made them for her but I forgot eggs or something, bad memory lol, and they came out kinda funny textured. Trying to think but I can't remember anything worse. My mom has forgotten something in a cheese cake and it cane out really runny. And one time she made a banana cheesecake but it wasn't very sweet so she took all the stuff inside the crust and mashed it with something other stuff then put it in a cupcake liner on top of an Oreo she's good at fixing things",0.6538,115
"Once I tried to make fortune cookies like the ones that you get in Chinese restaurants...I think that my mistake was when I had to add melted butter to the batter because the batter had eggs and the melted butter was so hot that I believe that I cooked the eggs, as a result my ""fortune cookies"" were like sticky pancakes that I couldn't shape like fortune cookies 😢😂💔",0.6249,76
"Once my best friend and I tried to bake Blondies (like brownies but vanilla) and we ended up burning the absolute shit out of them, however the craziest part was when we went to clean the pan...

I mean egg fart is the only way to describe this smell and we talk about those blondies often!! 😂😂😂",-0.9131,101

"Well, here's a few
1) Around 8 years ago, when I first starter baking, the recipe called for 1/3 cup(around 83 ish grams). I've never used that measurement, as I was used to 1/4,1/2, and whole cups. I tried to do it in between 1/4 and 1/2, but I did way too much. The cake ended up being way too moist, and the eggs didn't get mixed in-they just sank to the bottom. 
2) About a month ago, I tried making monster cookies for the first time. I think I used too much water, because the cookies came out flat as pancakes, not to mention they were burnt. 
3) The first time I made buttercream frosting, I used salted butter. As you can imagine, that didn't go well.",-0.1707,156

"When I was 13 (about 7 years ago) and knew nothing about baking, me and my friend tried to make brownies. It was a very simple 'recipe' - the 'just add butter and milk' kinda thing. So to add the butter, it needed to be at room temperature, ours just came out of  the fridge so we put it in the microwave for a tiny bit. Stupid as we were, we didn't take the foil off so it turned into a tiny fireworks show and a lot of teenage-girl-screaming. Adding the milk, I believe it should've been 100 milliliters, we accidentally measured 100 centiliters (aka a whole liter) and well, the brownies weren't great.",-0.5851,134
"When I was like eleven years old I tried to bake my first macarons. Well, they turned out to be grey instead of purple, were way too big and as most apart from round as possible. They also didn't have any feet, the surface was uneven and it even cracked on several macarons. Another problem was that they didn't harden but stayed sticky and unstable. Also my buttercream had to much sugar in it and tasted much too sweet. Well... The worst thing about all of this was that I had used a bad recipe and at the end I had like only six or seven ugly macarons after about three hours of work... At least my brother liked them. 😂💖",-0.8225,133
When i started baking my first attempt at something a bit complicated (not so complicated for the pros though) was to make Meringue Cookies. It was a flop from the shiny hard glossy peaks because i didn't mix it long enough or because i let yolks go inside and also because i didn't use super fine sugar. i Had turned it over my head and i was a sticky mess after. Then when i finally got that right it was a fail with baking them. I always over baked them and they tasted horrible. I didn't add vanilla or any flavoring and the sugar made everything grainy. After a few more attempts and soooo much research i finally made a good batch. Just the journey to making them was so tiring.,-0.9207,141
"When i was young i was really into baking fancy things. So I tried to bake meringues.

"that so funny that you would ask about Baking fails. I loved to bake and last year I made it my new years resolution to bake something once a month , cakes or cupcakes. I became very ambitious in March and tried to make the chocolate flan cake.  I preheated the oven as usual. did everything the way the directions said. Instead of turning on the timer I some how turned the oven off! It cooked a little bit from the residual heat before I realized my error. I turned the over back on so it can cook fully and it passed the toothpick test so at that point I was convinced that it was fully cooked. I took it out and let It cool completely.  I put a cake stand inverted on top and when I went to flip it out.......it was gooooosh. the flan did not set and it went everywhere. a sticky mess. the bright side the cake turned into very delicious Chocolate Tres Leche ...... that was my story and I was sticking to it lol.",0.96,195
