"@Zidders Roofurry  To be honest, it seems to me that they are covering it up a little. With the implications of the dialogue in this video, it might get weird for anyone looking into this in the future. It should be reasonable to assume that Disney is trying to distance themselves from him.

As for ""punishing"" him, this is punishing the original creators and viewers more so than him. I am willing to bet that the creator of the show had to dub over this just preserve the original animation, but I HIGHLY doubt that it took *days* to redub around a minute of dialogue.",-0.611,118

AlkisenSuper yeah his was just weird he wasn't molesting children or anything,0.5532,12
"All he did was asking other people for consentual sexual experience and when being refused haven't pushed it any further. There's nothing wrong with that. The only inappropriate thing he did was that telephone call wank, but it's not that big of a deal and later he called her again and appologised heavily, so I'll let it slide.",0.0457,63
"Are you fucking kidding me? Cornering a woman and jerking it in front of her makes him ""Not such a bad guy""? Oh hey I know that guy murdered someone but at least he didn't screw the corpse!

"Are you serious? The first line of my comment includes the phrase ""nothing that he admitted to, and more to the point, nothing from the testimony of the women in question"" and that is still your reply?

Christian Schoff I know I just liked him way too much before this. I'm still kind of in denial,0.4215,20
"Christian, take it easy. I didn't say what he did wasn't awful, because it really was. It's just that with all the offenders coming out I don't really understand why C.K. is getting more attention than scumbags like Brett Ratner or Al Franken. Ratner is a fucking rapist, yet I don't see him talked about nearly as much. I don't think dubbing him out of an episode really achieves anything, it's like removing an actor from an old movie because of something he did afterwards.
I also gotta admit I forgot he cornered her, which does make what he did even worse. That's a mistake on my part.

If it sounded like I minimized his actions, I'm very sorry, it wasn't my intention.",-0.4949,141

It is like a dystopian future. Do you realize that Louis CK was *never even accused of committing a crime*? The allegations that were made against him were never criminal at all, they were just stories about behavior that could be called ""inappropriate"".",0.6851,119

"Nothing that Louis admitted to, and more to the point, nothing from the testimony of any of the women in question, suggested anything vicious or predatory about what he did. In each case, he made his approaches in a characteristically awkward way, more harmless and pathetic than aggressive or insidious. He did not let his mask of humanity slip, revealing some bullying depraved beast. He was possessed by a sexual compulsion, an embarrassing and, to most, strange one, but not one that was ever of a part with any intent to harm other people or to take advantage of anyone. More to the point, and by all accounts, from Jen Kirkman to the official five, when he actually committed the act, it was only after consent was established. The shakiness, or dubiousness, of that consent is the center of what should be the conversation about what happened between Louis and these women. The conversation which has been shut down by bizarre and irrational waves of pure eye-rolling animalistic paranoia and hatred. The only accusation that is *even being brought against him* really, is that he took advantage of a ""power dynamic"" and that the women who acquiesced did so only because of an unspoken disadvantage of some kind. None of the victims were specific about what this was, beyond saying that they admired him as a comedian. When these things took place, Louis had a stature in hollywood that was a fraction of what it became. He was not wealthy, he was in no way a power player who was calling the shots, and there is no reason to believe that threats were ever made about careers or futures or anything else. 

The entire crucifixion of Louis CK, who mere moments ago was everyone's favorite guy in the world, is based on assumptions, and steamrolling hysteria of the kind that makes people post comments as ignorant and overtly hateful as the one I'm responding to. Louie's daughters, who from every extant account have a fantastic father in him, don't get to see him in a show like this now. The quickness, coldness, and completeness with which the world has turned on him, and the morbid silence that followed the turn, is monstrous. It is both tragic, and to any sane humanitarian soul, truly disturbing.",-0.9612,435

"Say what you will about the guy, but CK's version was way funnier. You can tell this is just a ""quick, we need to replace this voice."" And it shows. 

Honestly, if I remember correctly doesn't the creator of this show know Justin Roiland from Rick and Morty? I think this would have been a way better redub if they got Justin to do a rick like voice for the character. Even Dan Harmon would have been cool. I think Ryan Ridley would have been really funny too",0.9716,99

Now everyone turns their back on him with absolute coldness, destroying the work he did on his new movie and even trying to ERASE HIM FROM HISTORY, and nobody will say a word about it. It is absolutely disgusting the way people have acted. Like coldhearted traitors. Treating him as if he were a rapist or a wife-beater, because he was creepy about how he approached women ASKING THEM if he could do something sexual with them, TEN YEARS AGO. It is absolutely insane.",-0.7933,158

They're not trying to cover anything up. Everyone knows he was in the show. They're doing the right thing-punishing someone who preyed on people. If they wanted to cover it up it would have been cheaper for them to delete the scene instead of pay Alex a days scale to redub it.,-0.1027,56

Wait Alex was serious about dubbing him? I thought they just replaced Louis CK's voice with Alex's in the credits because they were just lazy.,-0.0772,27
"Wait until all the evil stuff Disney's been involved with involving children eventually comes out to the public. It'll make Louis look like a saint. Call it a conspiracy theory or whatever, but there are victims who have spoken out, and their voices will be heard by the public one day. Society as we know it is in its last days. Brands and companies you trusted will have their reputations damaged beyond repair and be forced to go out of business. This is so ironic coming from a company like Disney, if you've done your fair share of research. They are far from the wholesome family image they attempt to project on the public consciousness. And I say that, despite being a fan of Disney's old films and respecting animation techniques.

Anyway, I will always watch only the Louis version of this episode from now on. What he did was wrong, but this is extremely petty. In a few years, he'll have his chance at a comeback, I'm sure of it. Compared to everyone else, he's a saint, and it's a shame he had to take the fall so early, but I know he will redeem himself. He is not a bad person.",-0.4844,227
