To me, it just seems to be a distraction and I think the vocals more often undermine the power of the music which is meant to support them.

Maybe from an artist with more dynamic vocals in their music, it would suit better.",0.1257,101

"Well.. as someone who genuinely loves opera music, the explanation of why Carmen specifically is chosen isn't too convincing for me. Carmen is one of the ""ABC's of opera,"" meaning it's one of the most popularly performed and recognizable operas (the other two being Aida and La boheme, which--fun fact--the Broadway musical RENT is based off). Yes, Carmen is a strong, fun, and coquettish character, but Carmen is also a good opera to choose when introducing newcomers to opera music. Considering the fact that most ice skaters who are competing on the world stage are in their mid-teens to early 20s, and considering the fact that music with lyrics is only newly allowed to be used, it's not a surprise to me that these young athletes were/are choosing such recognizable classical music, especially since that age group is typically when one starts diving into these kinds of genres in greater depth. (That, and I'm sure the fact that Carmen is a character who unapologetically goes after what she wants surely must connect to the competing skaters.) Additionally, although Carmen ends tragically (as do Aida and La boheme), Carmen is definitely the ABC of opera with the most upbeat music, and since you wanna keep the crowd invested in your skate, again, it makes sense to choose the fun and flirtatious pieces from Carmen, which I think are much more.. distinguishable from the rest of opera arias as a whole than in Aida and La boheme, which must make breaking down the story of the opera more clear and memorable for the skater in creating and learning about a character for new routines. Every modern (instrumental) song has an arc, just like many or most pieces of classical music have movements. And when it comes to Tchaikovsky... I once heard in an opera podcast that Tchaikovsky incorporated Western musical stylings into his works. And considering that Russian has  d o m i n a t e d  this sport for decades, and historically spent centuries, I believe, trying to ""modernize"" itself as a country by following Western European example (especially French example; Carmen is a French opera, btw, for those unfamiliar with it), again, it's no surprise to me that skaters often choose Swan Lake. Just my two sense ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",0.9828,442
