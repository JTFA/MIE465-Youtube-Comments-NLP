"Okay, light travels at 300,000,000 m/s in a vacuum and their playback is at 25fps. Say they shone a torch, it would take 1/300,000,000th of a second for the light to travel one metre. So to see the light travel 1 metre in 1 second, they'd have to film 300,000,000 times faster. So, 300,000,000 * 25fps, which is 7,500,000,000 frames per second.
