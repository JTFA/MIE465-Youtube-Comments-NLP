"The scent is honey and all of the other natural ingredients in the foundation. The product smells the way it does because Burt's Bees did not add perfume to mask or neutralize the natural scent. A lot of fragrance-free products on the market smell like nothing because manufacturers had added perfumes to neutralize the scents of the ingredients used, artificially creating the ""unscented"" effect.",0.8271,70

"To me it smells like those fireball jawbreaker candies. Call me strange, but that is exactly what mine smells like. Then again, I may just have a weird sense of smell because my too faced born this way concealer smells like whiskey so bad that I tried it once and never touched it again. I hate that stupid concealer j ist because of the smell. And the smell doesn't seem to go away. I don't mind the fireball candy smell of this foundation....but I am so scared to try it on my face because I have sensitive skin to certain things. Not acne, more like allergic reaction, rash, chemical burn type of deal....so I'm terrified to try it. Lol. But I guess I will just have to go for it and see what I think.",-0.9675,153

michael50694 makeup brands seem to only focus on the pale and medium skin tones I agree.
