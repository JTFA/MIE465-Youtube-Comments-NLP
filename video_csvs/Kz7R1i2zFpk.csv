Having a lot of money and fame can get you that presidential seat, but why take it if you're not as qualified?? Good on her for knowing. Too many people just take things because they can. Pride can land you in some shitty situations,  then you'll cry about how you don't get treated fairly, but if you'd just put in the same amount of work that everyone else did maybe you wouldn't be getting burned so damn much(of course some situations have an exception) Kids please take your time and access things before you do it.

"Jimmy , you need to stop and reflect on what you are doing. In your position,  you should not be political if you want to be the best in your field . When you trash a sitting President constantly and you trash all the Americans that voted him in , you are disrespecting us. You are on a stage that you could be using to help make this world a better place , by uniting people , regardless of their party or political beliefs , but instead you focus on dividing this country by bashing the good people that where wise enough to vote Trump into office, and thats a lot of people. I like you Jimmy , you have some great talent to make people laugh , but I can not watch you anymore , I can't respect someone who doesn't respect me. I am just an average Joe , so you probably could care less , but mark my words , you will regret your actions one day . You will look around and see that America took off in a different direction , and you missed the bus. You will no longer be relevant.  There you are , remembered as the guy who divides the country with political jokes that sucked . BUT - I still have hope for you dude . Turn it around , unite us, embrace Trump .  Respect him .  That would make you look mature and respectful and smart . It would make you look like a cool cat .You will be amazed how powerful that would be in the eyes of the public . So , there ya go, my advice to you because I believe you are not really a prick , although I have never met you , my gut feeling is telling me that you can turn it around. I hope you turn it around for the sake of humanity .  Good luck Jimmy -  David from the Westside of S.Barbara Ca.",0.9972,347
