*The Helpful Garden*

The idea is to design a homeless shelter using Aquaponics and permaculture to feed them as well as make money for them. Each place will have 9 to 13 (12 x 18) 216 sq ft building for living in. So the *""Helpful Garden""* will be shelter to up to 13 people as well as a farmers market. The one thing about homeless shelters is that one can be built every 80 miles about or so. I can see a minimum of 3000 homeless shelters of the ""Helpful Garden"" being built worldwide. (Powered by solar & wind) To build said place is about $500,000 depending where it built. Though it won't need donation or government grants to run for all it's money comes from it farmers market.

*Profits:* 
40% profit breakdown:

Money needed for sheltered women: $15,000/each allotted to each tiny home each year.  plus stables (Example: coffee, sugar, flour, salt and pepper)

60% profit breakdown:

Maybe you're conflating accuracy with precision?

The fact that water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas doesn't somehow discredit human induced warming, it just exposes your lack of knowledge on positive feedback systems. For an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, the atmosphere will heat up by a certain amount. It's this heating that, due to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, allows for more water to be held as vapour in the atmosphere, thereby enhancing the already present greenhouse effect, and creating a positive feedback loop. This is the part that we should be worried about, and attempt to resolve.

I asked about actual research predicting this doom but you don't want to answer, apparently. It's a popular news piece and let's get on this on, shall we.
1) The seed vault wasn't flooded, little ice melted on the hallway and nothing actually got in. 
2) All of the methane will not actually be released as permafrost warms.
3) The rate we emit greenhouse gases is slowly decreasing, atleast CO2 has for the past few years. Not that CO2 emissions would be lower but the increasing trend is slower. Just like population increase. It's still increasing, but at a slower rate.
4) We don't need to colonize other plants to survive global warming. If we can create habitats on other planets to simulate Earth, then we can make those on Earth itself. It's even easier. Yes, go colonize other planets, perhaps if unavoidable asteroid comes then we have people aver the solar system, but it being a necessity for surviving global warming is just bullshit.

"I think you have to understand that this is the internet and the loudest voices tend to be the most extreme on both sides. The reality of the argument really has nothing to do with whether the climate changes or not. Nobody is actually denying that the climate changes, the argument is how much of an impact humans have on that change and what to do about it. When you look at industry, companies will always be able to adapt to overcome environmental impact and we have seen that throughout history, companies develop cleaner and more efficient methods of production regardless of government interference primarily because efficiency reduces cost. Those of us on the right recognize that private companies have been the primary creators in cleaner, more environmentally friendly technology and we reject the idea that creating more taxes on production will only damage economic growth and won't do anything positive for the environment or climate. The ideas proposed at the government level are essentially, if we take more money from businesses, we will prevent the earth from warming. We can also look at where money gets spent to determine the validity of certain arguments. The scientists that are saying that humans are causing catastrophic levels of damage to the climate rely on that idea to be true in order to have a job. Alternatively, private businesses don't lose any money either way. In fact, all types of green energy products from those that generate power such as solar panels to those that consume power such as electric cars rely so much on the oil industry that it actually makes them more money due to the need for more plastics and other oil based products. Ultimately, we're not afraid of changing technology or any of that because that's already happening and America's private businesses are the biggest creators of green technology. What we are afraid of is that we are allowing our government to slow our progress by taking even more money out of our economy through taxation and give that money to countries who create much higher levels of pollution and then allow those countries to tell us how much pollution we are allowed to generate by certain arbitrary dates and then fine us even more money if we don't meet those requirements. Instead, we should be helping companies to develop even more efficient methods of production by lowering their operating costs so they can afford to hire more research and development. Imagine how much money would be saved if a trucking company developed an engine or motor that operated on a cheaper energy source than diesel. The savings in shipping costs alone would create millions of new jobs and help the climate all without a single carbon tax!",0.9577,485

"Just think about this for a moment - as the video clearly says and you can see on charts, the heating and cooling cycles of the earth are many and rise and fall in 300,000, 50,000, and 15,000 year increments.  We're near the end of a 15,000 year warming cycle right now; the ocean has risen about 400 feet (before industrialization) in our current cycle.  This is all well documented and you can easily look it up.  But, to say our models only go back to 1850 and there is clearly a warming trend, is true, but is not indicative of the equations necessary to create the multiple tri-heating/cooling periods the earth has experienced.  With or without mankind the earth would be warming since 1850.  The only way to know if the tiny fraction of C02 that humans create will affect a 300,000, 50,000, or 15,000 year cycle would be to have a model that explains the last 1.2 million years (or more, at least 4 major cycles) and then has enough detail to try and predict tiny changes of 50 to 100 years.
Just think about the oceans being 400 feet lower and how that affected glaciers, ocean currents, let alone where was all this water stored and how did that affect weather patterns, plant growth, erosion, etc.  No one will know for sure if industrialization has had an effect for another 1000 to 2000 years, and that just based on the tiny 15,000 year cycle.",0.875,277

"Most of what this guy is saying is not true. The computers we have are not powerful enough to simulate fluid flow over the entire Earth using physics. A lot of assumptions must be built into the models, those assumptions are not based on physics, but rather are based on statistical correlations. Statistics is not physics. 

Statistics based models are highly fallible, because statistics are interpreted by the individual implementing them into the model. 

The Proof that statistics based models lack the same kind of predictive power as physics based models can be seen in the number of different climate models. Each one saying something different, because each team that made them made different assumptions. Also these climate models are constantly changed. They hold the outcome ""global warming caused by CO2"" constant, and manipulate the rest of the model, and the data until the simulation again agrees with this basic assumption that man made CO2 causes global warming.

Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. One thing for sure is that models built under such bias constraints will never unravel the truth.

2) The CO2 concentrations have been 20 times higher than today, never mind 2 times. The average temperature has also been 14 degrees C higher than today. The sea levels were also 70m higher. The sun was also a lot cooler.

3) Mars has atmosphere composing of 95.97% CO2
   Venus has atmosphere composing of 96.5 % CO2
Does their atmosphere matter in this discussion? No.

4) Then write a scientific paper and prove all those scientists wrong. If it's something so basic, why not do it? Revolutionize science. Perhaps win a nobel prize.",0.7724,222

"Who is yelling doom about climate? Is it your average Joe the Plumber, or the actual scientists? I'm asking because I can't find any in the scientific research, which is supported anyway.

What burdens hard to bear? In what world is telling you how the climate and Earth will be in coming centuries a bad thing? Telling you consequences of your actions is a bad thing? 
Even if the scientists were coming up with restrictions (which *they* are not doing), they would be following them anyway. They would follow the new law.

Wonder what climate scientists are doing all the time and why aren't they helping me with my garden work? They surely have nothing to do or anything.

Because mitigating collateral damage is suddenly a bad thing? What should they do? Suppress a civilian filled town with artillery and then move in guns blazing?

You talk about religion of leftism but all I saw was vague comments on how your life is so hard because of climate research? Once climate scientists start to harvest grain by hand to save a little gasoline, then you know they went all dogmatic.

And somehow everything that leans to the left is automatically a bad thing. Leftists cried in campus because someone said she instead of ze, climate is a talking point of the left, that means climate science is bogus? It doesn't work that way. Would you talk about conservatives who want to ban abortion and say Earth is 6000 years old? No, you wouldn't, yet creationists are in US government. 

""You are either with us, or against us."" That would sum up your view of the left and it's very biblical of you. We can agree and disagree on different topics. You think because I talk about climate like it's a serious thing means I want to fight against white people or something? No. However you view the world, I might not like it, I might tell that you are stupid, but I would never take away your platform and right to say it. Something which authoritarian left has been doing for the past few years. I'm not saying our planet or the human race is doomed. I'm not a stalinist/communist just because I think government is necessary and so are some social programs. Yet, I can be against something a certain governemnt does. I think religion is stupid and has no place in the modern world, but I wouldn't force anyone to drop their faith.

My point is, the world isn't so black and white.",-0.9859,480
