Do they make you hungry, happy, relaxed, nervous?  The font, the colors, the size all play a part in conveying the correct message.

But why does it taste so bad?
I've been to Germany twice, and the only thing that wasn't awesome was the food. 

I have never heard of the bread thing though, so I never paid much attention on it, maybe I missed something special and unique? :)

I always thought the national foods of Germany were things like Weißwurst, Pfannkuchen, etc. and all of my friends who've been to Germany as well have reported similar experiences with restaurants and bakeries. Have you been to Germany? :)",0.7145,99
"Joakim is right, German bread is amazing and there are bakeries like everywhere aaaall over the country. 
Also there's more to German cuisine than just the Bavarian side: go up North to Hamburg or Sylt next time and try fish or lamb or other stuff! :)",0.8622,50

"She liked the ""Boulangerie"" sign, because it told her that it was a *french* bakery, and french bakeries are almost always good, whereas Germany doesn't exactly have the finest chefs in the world.
Even though she spoke neither German nor French, she had obviously seen such a sign before and associated it with the delicious French cuisine.

Not because of some stupid letter design. I get that it can hint some things, but I don't believe it to be this expressive.

"There isn't a single crowded place I visited, that was really good. Quality and quantity are never achieved together. You have to make compromises (like spending 3 mins on a dish when there is a line of 100 people outside the kitchen, instead of 10 who will happily wait for 30 mins with a glass of wine). You can throw money at problems, hiring more people or introducing newer tech into what you are doing, but it also complicates things a lot, up until you can't control them. Lastly - if you have tonns of people going through your spot every day - you don't have a lot of insentives to go an extra mile. You get your money anyway. Everyone hates or despises Macdonalds, but they still will go there, instead of some unknown place or a cafe - for all the different reasons (money, fear, laziness, liking Macs, etc).",-0.7937,173
