"I have 2 cochlear implants after wearing hearing aids for most of my life. If you want to know what a cochlear implant sounds like, the answer is, it depends.

When they were first turned on, what I felt were vibrations that came from a spot just above my ear, NOT sound. After a while, it became more like sound, like electronic garbling. Then I was able to pick out a few sounds like for example, ""s"" and ""sh"" were some of first sounds I recognized. I gradually was able to recognize even more sounds.

Now, everything pretty much sounds the same as when I had hearing aids. Only sounds are clearer, and easier to understand.

Music is a bit different. Much of it sounds the same though I think it sounds a bit ""flatter"" then from what I remember. I usually can only tell a difference if it's a song that I've listened to a million times before the surgeries.",0.936,187
"I have a cochlear implant, and the way they sound really depend on the person themselves too. Depending on how active your auditory nerve was before the implant plays a big factor. Since I went 20 years without mine being used, my CI only sounds like static. I can't make out voices, or any sounds at all really. I just can tell when sound is present. 
My friend who lost her hearing says hers sounds like robotic sounds. Like the talking doll. 
It really depends on who you are asking. It really does take a long time to learn to interpret sound with a CI. 
It's a lot of association, if i know someone is knocking on the door and it sounds like static that is in parts, then I know it is the door and it takes my brain to learn to associate that. There is also auditory therapy that can help with learning to hear again. 
The CI don't work for everyone either, some don't want them, and some it just doesn't end up working. And since you can't test them, you won't know until you have the surgery and have it activated. 
CIs aren't some magic cure. They aren't like glasses in the slightest, or even hearing aids. They are expensive, take lots of time, involve a surgery, and take loads of work and practice. However, they can end up helping people quite a bit. I am still learning to hear with mine, as I can't make out hardly any specific sounds with mine, but I know with more training and wearing I will get more used to it and learn to hear better. 
Thanks SciShow for bringing up this topic! I get asked this question lots and explain this a lot, but I love having it brought up.

When I had my Harmony Advanced Bionics, mind you, I had this chunky implant for about 10-11 years. It was old, barely functioning because the magnetic headpiece was weak and it would literally fall off if I moved my head too fast. T-Mic was a disaster cause it would get wet easily cause I like to do activities a lot. The sound audio was okay, could tell the differences between people’s voices but if I were to close my eyes and just assume? I’ll have to think extra hard to figure who it is. Yikes lol 

Now I got the Naída CI Q Series, sooo much better! Weighed like nothing on my ear, I can listen to music via bluetooth by the Compact Phonak like wow ! No need to buy headphones 😋 and the sound? Sounds so much clearer. I could hear everything (not literal) and I could tell the differences between voices if I closed my eyes. Magnetic headpiece was great too, I didn’t have to worry about it falling off so easily cause the field was amped up to make it stronger to stay on.

While it's true that the results can differ depending on the patient, I can tell you that for a lucky recipient (like me) who gets the full effect and has something to compare it to, the ""talking doll that's running low on batteries"" comparison is so wrong.

"If it takes an FFT of the surounding sound, but only has 24 or so sound bins (I guess its a limitation of the limited DSP capacilities of the low power ARM micro inside one of these things), my guess is that it would sound like very heavily compressed audio, like videocalling on facebook when the link speed is very low / or breaking up.

 Audio compression does a descrete cosine transform and only records the loudest frequency components in in descrete sections of an audio stream to reduce data throughput requirments. This I think should have the same(ish) effect as sound -> low-res FFT -> direct stimulation of the ear canal. I'm going to see if I can take a song in audacity, take an FFT of it with a low number of bins, and then take that frequency domain result and convert the crippled audio back into the time domain for my functional ears to experiance the lack of frequency content. Although I also expect the DAC's nonlinear interpolation and reconstruction filterinng as well as the acoustic dynamics of a physical audio transducers (my $9 earbuds!) to re-intruduce some of the frequencies that I attempted to filter away with all that DSP BS.

"Just want to point out a couple of bits - the cochlea isn't hollow, it's filled with fluids; perilymph and endolymph. Also, the implantation process destroys any traditional hearing, as the fluids in the ear are essential for vibration to travel through and stimulate the hair cells.
In a nutshell, having a cochlear implant put in is a one way process and there is currently no way to restore normal hearing function if it is removed. This is why cochlear implants tend to be an option of last resort for audiologists and where possible, we try to exhaust our options with traditional hearing aids first.",-0.5574,115

I was wondering how it works. I was recently told that if you get a shot, it may not even cover the strain that comes this year....?
If I had no shot and ended up contracting ""the flu"" would my body build up a natural immunity to that strain and I would be less susceptible to it if that particular strain ever came back around? If so it would seem unwise to get a shot because your body would never build a resistance..?
I understand as well that when people say ""the flu"" or inFLUenza virus, this possibly refers to Two different effects.(sinus and fever versus vomiting)
