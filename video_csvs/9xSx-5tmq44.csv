"I hated this movie so much that I had to walk out of the theater for a few minutes. It was just garbage, who thought it would be a good idea to have some of these god awful scenes
1: having an old man relive his divorce in an improv scene while everyone is laughing thinking it's an act and watching him break into tears
2. Having an incest joke where the little boy kisses his step sister and everyone treats him like an animal even though he's just a kid and is just a little confused
3. An uncomfortably dragged out scene of Mel Gibson and Mark whalberg kissing on the lips
4. Mel Gibson's character walking out on his son twice in the movie to sleep with loose women. 
How did anyone think these good ideas?",0.7363,146
"I have to disagree with this review, but I respect your thought JJ. I had a great time with this movie. Love Lithgow and Gibson. The thermostat scene was hilarious! And the Liam Neeson stuff at the end was great too. Comedies are supposed to make you laugh and escape the drama from this crazy world. I thought this movie did just that.",0.9897,71

"I recently watched the first one again this morning and saw the second one after justice league. I laughed my ass off at this movie. Way funnier than the first movie. There was only 2 other ppl in the movie with me, but imo that makes bad movies bit better. The turkey shooting scene was hilarious. The only thing I would add, I started wondering who would play john cenas dad, I wanted hulk Hogan to show up at the end. Would have been perfect. 7/10.

One thing I might add, sometimes i couldn't tell if Mel Gibson was trying to make a joke or being serious. He was amazing and so was everyone else.",0.9636,129
"I saw the movie. Complete waste of time. I HATE movies with liberal agenda shoved. The gender neutrals card, anti-Gun jokes, and at the end when the kid was kissing all these girls in line. Then a Boy popped up in the back. And the tipping incest kiss from stepsister. Just NO.",-0.3952,61
