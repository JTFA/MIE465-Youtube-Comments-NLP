"I normally like your videos, but this one got to me. Some people do mock other cultures, while some people genuinely appreciate other cultures. It was called Native-Inspired wasn’t it? Meaning it was an inspired look, and not the actual look verbatim. It is unfair to generalize. By you cherry-picking what race you want to not mock, you are being hypocritical. Not all white women are ignorant and mocking Natives. And before you say (if you do), that because I’m white so I don’t understand, just know that I’m not only white, but I’m also Cherokee. I am not full Cherokee, so I don’t fully understand, but there is a big difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation. If someone was going about while intentionally being disrespectful and making a joke out of it, it would be a different story.",-0.6652,174
