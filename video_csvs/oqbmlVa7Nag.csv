South Korea literally has some of the highest suicide rates in the world, thats how western imposed capitalism is faring for them. While the self sufficient North Koreans have been able to endure the destruction of their entire country and killing of 20 percent of their population to rebuild a beautiful nation able to stand up to american hegemony. Main reason US doesnt like NK besides them being communist? Well its their nuclear weapons, and why you my ask does the DPRK need nuclear weapons?

Also if you would like an additional source to expand your mind on the subject try watching the Propaganda Game on netflix, its a whole documentary inside north korea that debunks many of the fabricated lies about the nation.",-0.6124,115
"M those ‚Äòrefugees‚Äô are paid by the South Korean Government to embellish their stories, and yet most of them take their story back years later, and in fact more people return to north korea than leave it. Not convinced? I dont blame you, decades of anti communist propaganda has an effect on most minds, but i will give you a famous example you can look up yourself. Her name is Park Yeon mi, she made a very popular and emotional but inconsistent story about north korea and made a living from cashing in from telling her stories. Look her up and just see how emotional she makes it, and yet it is all fake. 

Not convinced yet? Well if your mind isnt closed yet you can even check out this guardian article talking about how inconsistent most North Korean Defectors stories are.
