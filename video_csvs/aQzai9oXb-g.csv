You seemed a lot more genuine, intelligent, not as shallow and ""obsessed"" with being trendy when you lived in San Fransisco. You were much more original and now it feels like you're almost the same as all these other beauty/lifestyle Youtubers without any depth. Would love to see you being like the one you were before ❤ You  used to be an inspiration to be yourself and incuraged people to love their true self...
