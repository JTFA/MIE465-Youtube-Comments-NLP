"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!

Jesus loves you! 
He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. 

So God is not against us, He is FOR us! 

The Lord came down from heaven in the Person of Jesus Christ to die, and 3 days later, rise again! He did this to redeem us back to Himself, so that we may go Home. 

Friends, Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him. (John 6:37 paraphrased) 

So don't let anyone stop you from approaching Jesus today!

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

All those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

All you need is mustard seed faith and sincere words from the heart. Jesus will hear you! I assure you!

Shalom, friends!",0.9925,197

"The new season has been very good so far.  I'm glad Donald has the balls and honesty to show the foibles of the black community and not just play the ""blame whitey"" game.   Al's hook up robbing him. Tracy ripping Ern off, stealing shoes from a black run sore and when he doesn't get a job he was painfully obviously not qualified screaming racist were all hilariously spot on.  

Like the brilliant and sorely missed Chappele Show, Glover seems ready to toss black folks under the bus right along with white folks this season and I'm digging the fuck out of it.  I'm lifetime ATL white boy so my opinion matters.",0.6693,121
