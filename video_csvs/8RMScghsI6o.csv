"Can anybody answer the following question??

"" What films can you recall which analyze a successful marriage?""
I have read this in Theodore Zeldin's wonderful book "" Conversation"" and since then I have been wondering...  I know so many movies about marriage, which could all be put into the horror movie category,  but it is a pity that there is none I can think of, which shows you how is all that supposed go right! 

This video is a very beautiful example of a working relationship and how one can keep it that way. 

And here is a very hopeful quote from the book I have just mentioned: 

""Our private conversations do make a difference too the world.  A relationship may start chemically or romantically but conversation adds something infinitely precious to it.  Having one’s ideas challenged and transmuted by verbal intercourse makes one aware of how much one owes to others, how much a partner can contribute to one’s intellectual, moral and emotional development, though one remains a separate, unique person.  It is in private that one can best learn how to accept criticism. Two individuals conversing honestly, can be inspired by the feeling that they are engaged in a joint enterprise,aiming at inventing an art of living together which has not been tried before"". 

Thanks a lot for this very wise and tender lesson and to the great actors. Happy new year!  

I wish everyone all that we get so rarely: a clear mind, a lot of self compassion,  truly connecting conversations with friends and strangers and some hope... 

One of my heroes, the director Joshua Oppenheimer had posted last year this very touching new years message I wanted to share:

"Hello there! I understand... I have something similar, but it is getting better. I think it is called "" Pathological Altruism"". There is a book with this title by Barbara Oakley. And there is  another book called "" Against Empathy"" by Paul Bloom. He is a psychology professor at Yale. If you wish, listen to his interview on the "" Think Again"" podcast. To find the episode you can search for: 

"" Think Again, Paul Bloom, Cold Blooded Kindness"".

It is indeed a very beautiful and wise conversation. He offers us a much better version of compassion, which is "" rational compassion"". Finding a way where you can help, knowing that your help is really useful, but at the same time, not destroying yourself.

What I mean is that it seems to me that these goals were put into my mind by someone else but I can't seem to guess what I want by myself. It's like people say that we must work on our goals but what happens when you don't know for sure what your goals are. What I'm asking here is the most basic of all questions, the root of our decisions.

If you force yourself to change overnight it becomes a situation where you decide that either you succeeded or you failed with no in between.

This is a DREEEAM scenario. It's always seemed so simple andd logical. Yet, so elusive to experience. So many of us have felt hurt so  deeply & are all so guarded w/ the very things that lead to our liberation and freedom. This was an example of how a mature and loving relationship looks. The next step in the progression would be responding w/ empathy once one enevitably fails at their initial or perhaps prolonged attempts to let their best self come through....& the othe rto be willing to look at and shine a light on their issue in the moment...in real time. I suppose to celebrate the vickies in real time as well. ....Maan...It's like a beautiful dream that kind of scenario.",0.9915,211
