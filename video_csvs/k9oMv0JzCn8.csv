Her stage presence is getting better and better 😍,0.7003,9
Honestly for an A1 performance i think lip syncing is needed because dancing and singing is really hard. Cardi b didnt' really do anything on the stage apart from rapping the whole lyrics which is why her stage performance is a bit dead. I'd watch a Nicki Performance over a Cardi B performance due to stage performance.,-0.4576,61
