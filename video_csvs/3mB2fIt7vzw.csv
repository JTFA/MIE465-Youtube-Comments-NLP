"AVM3798 dude...I'm not hating on the switch, but look at the facts. The 3DS and definitely the PSVita sold poorly compared to their predecessors even though the 3DS sold more than the ps4 and that's cause they had mobile phones as their competition!",0.6901,49
AVM3798 the switch’s graphics portably are the best on the market. There’s no handheld that is as powerful as it is. Comparing the vita to the switch is like comparing a pocket knife to a sword.,0.8074,44
AVM3798 yes but like sony said...in this time and age people don't care about portable game consoles cause of the phone. So it was really smart of them to market the switch as a home console that you can take with you anywhere you go!,0.7131,50

"I have a Vita & PSTV and what you said makes absolutely no sense because Switch's hybrid nature's strength is it's versatility.

And it depends on the Pokemon game, the Pokken Tournament didn't exactly light the world on fire and oh yeah, that's being ported to the switch to...

I'm one of those burned by the lack of support on the Wii U, and I refuse to support them this gen until I can pick up a used console cheap because with the exception of Odyssey, there really isn't anything original announced or already released that seems to get me excited, and BOTW is good enough on the Wii U so that I can wait.",0.4097,191

I don't understand your issue here...because you have this strict rule about what a home console should be...Everything we're discussing here are gaming devices. Devices that let you play your games at home. Definition of console, or home console was created possibly before you were born, when we had arcades.
