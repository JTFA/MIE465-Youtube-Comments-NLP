"Just look at that Palomino running like the wind
And that pretty old paint is acting like she's young again
Sometimes I wonder where they'd go 
They didn't have that things

There's just something about horses
That can touch you deep down in your soul
Girl look at them go
Makes you wanna just throw off your cares and your troubles
And go somewhere no one's ever gone before, well

You and me can do that tonight and
Let the beat of our heart go flying
Underneath that milky way ceiling
If you wanna saddle up this feeling

Baby lets' ride that wild wind blowing
Let it kiss you some stars out of the sky
Get carried away like some deep river rolling
Tonight, I wanna be your cowboy lullaby

Can't you hear that half-moon calling?
He's gonna hang out all night long
And sing us a song, yeah
All you gotta do is take my hand and
You and me can be weed field dancing
Now that we got a good fire burning
Let's hide away and let the world keep turning

Baby, let's ride that wild wind blowing
Let it kiss you some stars out of the sky
Get carried away like some deep river rolling
Tonight, I wanna be your cowboy lullaby

Your cowboy lullaby

You and me can do that tonight and
Let the beat of our hearts go flying
Underneath that milky way ceiling
If you wanna saddle up this feeling

Baby lets' ride that wild wind blowing
Let it kiss you some stars out of the sky
Get carried away like some deep river rolling
Tonight, I wanna be your cowboy lullaby

Your cowboy lullaby
Ooh

There's just something about horses
That can touch you deep down in your soul
Girl look at them and go

Lullaby
