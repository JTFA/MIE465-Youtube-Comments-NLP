"My best guess is that half-way through writing the story, the author started feeling insecure about her own self-insert character. Even though Kate was basically a blank slate, she was ""played by"" Amanda Seyfried, and since her looks and what little personality and backstory Kate was given doesn't match the author, she needed to reaffirm her fantasy by making sure Josh somehow gets together with a girl who writes fanfics about Josh... and is really mean and terrible, for some reason? _And_ their fling was completely based on one drunken evening, whereas Kate and Josh at least spent a month together under difficult circumstances. But I guess an ugly dress is enough to undo all that. Honestly, I find it even more concerning that she made Josh such a dick - why would she want a guy who acts like that, regardless of whether she wants to be Kate or Kaitlyn? I don't know, I can't even begin to decipher the psychology behind the author's decisions.",-0.1088,184

There is something that happens in my mind. Whenever something is really odd or strange it instantly gets moved into a bank in the back of my mind.

Another one is in the FX show The Assassination of Giovanni Versace where the killer is dancing in his underwear while upbeat dance music plays in the background and an older man who's face is covered in duct tape writhes in pain on the bed. When the ending hit. Drunk Josh Hutcherson and Kaitlin puddling off into the ocean drunk while the first self insert remains on the island for who knows how long it was instantly added into this bank.
