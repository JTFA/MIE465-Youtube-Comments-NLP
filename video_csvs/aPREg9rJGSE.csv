"I hate how these sports shows loved to talk about lonzo when he was down but now that hes up they barely mention him and if they do a lot still think hes a bust, I WANT EVERY LAST ONE OF THESE PIECE OF DOO DOO PEOPLE THAT PUT LONZO DOWN TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM NOW, AND NO DON'T HOP ON THE ZO TRAIN, JUST APOLOGIZE!",0.5332,70

"You have heard God LOVES you. But is it true and do you believe it? It most definitely is true. In fact, He loves you so much that for a time, He gave up what was most dearest to Him: His only Son (Jesus). Jesus offered His life as a payment for the punishment that we sinners deserve (there is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood). Jesus the Christ died in our place on a cross some 2000 years ago and then defeated death, rising on the third day. We can escape hell and receive heaven via God's free gift of forgiveness and eternal life. ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.""    

Don't be deceived, trust in the Savior Jesus and follow Him. Jesus said ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life."" God's free gift to man is eternal life. We have all sinned (lied, stolen, lust, used God's name as a curse word etc...), so we are guilty of sin against God. First admit you are a sinner, then ask God to forgive you. Accept and believe what Jesus has done for you and start following Him. Find a good, Bible-believing, Christian Church where you will be encouraged to follow Jesus Christ. Then share the GOOD NEWS with others. ❤️❤️❤️ (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6-10; John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9834,336
