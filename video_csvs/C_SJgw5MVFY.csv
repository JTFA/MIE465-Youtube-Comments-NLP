"Chrizly-Charts There is so much wrong with everything you said I don't even know where to start. First of all, no my point is not ""comparing some vandalism to racists"". Why is everything about racism with you people? Second, UC Berkeley wasn't ""some vandalism"". They literally beat people who wanted to hear this speaker and didn't allow this speaker to talk whilst burning down their city. (1st ammendment rights violation? No?) Beating people for their beliefs is worse than being a racist. ""If my forefathers knew how I'd think about the right-wings in my country..."" What do I think about the right-wings in my country? Do you even know? ""Real Americans are people who cherish the first ammendment..."" Well then I guess I'm a real American and those rioters at UC Berkeley are not. You make a lot of assumptions about me and then judge me based on the assumptions YOU made. And fuck the whole ""the only real Americans are the native Americans."" It's getting old. I suppose we should go and divide Europe so that only the people that originally were on each piece of land live there again. I did not immigrate here. Nor did my father nor my grandfather nor his father. And the moronic thing is that YOU SAID THAT WE SHOULD CHERISH IMMIGRATION and then immediately said none of us belong here...what? 

Again my main point (it's like beating my head into a wall), we're sick of people like you telling us what is and what isn't, what we are and aren't supposed to think, we are sick of you telling as what we are and what we know.

(The ""Crowned the devil a winner"" part etc.) This song does not tell us that Trump is the bad guy. It tells us ""WTF, why did we let hate win? Are we so fucked up?""

"I just want to answer you, not about your beliefs because they are yours. If you think Trump is a great man it's up to you. I could try to prove you that you're wrong but that's not the point. The point is that you're being rude with people who don't deserve it. They only wrote this song because that's how they felt. Look for the story of the song, Mandy Lee wrote it after the election because she was shocked. If you listen to the lyrics they are clearly about anger and disappointment and shock. Let people be angry and disappointed and shocked with Trump if they want to.
""And that's why you idiots hate our president. Because hes a white man."" What a shame that all the members of Misterwives are white people. I think they hate themselves when they look in a mirror. 
""This video and song are nothing but propaganda against white people and men."" The band is composed of 1 white women and 5 white men. Except for that, they hate White men, sure.
""Thats the beauty of not being a mind slave."" Very ironical coming from someone who stops listening to a band because ONE song does not fit their political opinion. 
""Obviously you dont care about free thinking."" Do you? 
""The only reason i listened to you is because one of your songs were remixed by someone else and it lead me to discover that song machine. You are a terrible group and i hope you see the problems youve caused once you lose fans and stay d list singers or what the hell ever you are."" Wow, THAT's hypocrisy. So a band is bad because they don't like Trump. Hating Trump = doing bad music. Not very logical, are you? You sound like a child having a tantrum. If you hate them because of this song, say it. Don't accuse their music, even more so if you have listened to one song only. Plus, saying ""your music is terrible"" is NOT a valid argument when you're here to critic the lyrics and the video. (Let alone the fact that you give literally no argument to prove that their music is really terrible.)
Obviously you will tell me that I am a terrible person too because I'm defending Misterwives so I support Clinton aka 666 (I hate her btw) and so I hate white people (too sad I'm one) and so I hate males too (nothing to say about it, I'm a girl) etc. etc. You will tell me that I'm just another one who bashes Trump, and that Trump is a victim of undeserved bashing. Maybe you're right. (I agree that there is an awful lot of bashing for the sake of bashing.)  I may tell you that you're wrong and that I don't want to offend you, but you won't trust me, will you? So I'm just telling you this: maybe you're right and all, but if Trump and his supporters have so bad a reputation, maybe is it because his supporters attack people who have a different opinion, and they do it with a lot of hatred and of insults and without justification and without real arguments?",-0.9992,613

"NAPSB I don't think it's as obvious as you may think it is, to be honest. Thank you for informing us of the story- whilst I can recall the story now, I wouldn't, and evidently didn't, get that reading from this video. Ultimately though, it remains subjective; there's lots of alternatives to what the bull could represent dependent on the viewer, and all are very interesting!

And whilst yes; a lot of western references do end up biblical, it varies dependent on which country's culture you are analysing- not all countries have the same pop culture, after all: alongside the fact they are all very multifaceted!  When it comes to knowledge of biblical scripts though- I'm literally studying Paradise Lost just now at university, and still couldn't have assigned the same reading of the bull in this video; the biblical scripts are vast and various, and being unable to identify one thing alone doesn't mean a person has no knowledge on the subject as a whole. Again, it's one of the things that makes studying things like this and all subsequent allusions so interesting. :)

Ultimately though, this video is amazing either way; powerful and meaningful and an amazing work of art. Hats off to MisterWives as always 😍🎶",0.9852,237

"Okay so about the ox being the leader. 
I am a French girl and I immediately saw a very French reference in it. (But maybe I'm wrong?)
In France we are all compelled to learn some poems since a very young age. Among them there are the poems written by La Fontaine, which are basically moral tales that denounced the games of power (or the game of thrones if you prefer c: ) that occurred during the 17th century in France.
One of those poems is called ""Les deux taureaux et une grenouille"" i.e. ""two bulls and a frog"". The two bulls have a fight: they both want to have the throne and a very desirable heifer. The frog tells them that this fight is stupid because the loser will have nothing out of it; he will live in swamps chasing frogs to eat, while the winner is the new king. 
At the end the frog is right, and the whole frog population is wiped out by the bull who lost the fight. The poem ends like this: ""De tout temps / Les petits ont pâti des sottises des grands"" which basically means: ""people always suffer because of the stupidity of the  powerful ones"". 
What do you think about it ?

"See this is where you get it wrong - because you can't support first ammendment and people that are AGAINST the first ammendment. That's like saying I'm against abortion but I support people that abort. Your either with it or against it. And regarding UC Berkeley - it's obvious on which site you stand that's why you distort the truth unfortunately because it began with peaceful protests before hundred Antifas startet to riot. Yeah that sucks but to blame all people that peacefully protested is the same as saying all Muslims are terrorists - and that's something that Trumplets are pretty good at - it's always 'the left' 'the Muslims' and on the other hand 'the real Americans'. Sorry, no. That's not how this world works. There are real Americans that are Muslims, real Americans that are gay, real Americans that are black, real Americans that are Latinos. That's America.

The Charging Bull has become a symbol of capitalism, most notably used by the Occupy Wall Street protesters as a symbol to direct their anger and criticism.

Naturally, the bull has indeed also been likened to the golden calf in Exodus 32.  Fundamentally, the golden calf symbolizes the worship of false gods, and in Wallstreet's case, that would be money.

Because the Wallstreet Bull has often been connected to the Golden Calf, I cannot argue that there is one correct interpretation of this video.  But i'd wager Misterwives (and the artist behind this video), were thinking of Wallstreet when they used the bull, not the Golden Calf--this video is littered with political references, not religious ones.

For context: I've been raised in a Catholic household my entire life, went to church every Sunday, and studied at the Catholic University of America.  I for one did not pull Exodus 32 from this video, because the context of the video suggests otherwise.

Please, refrain from belittling strangers with your ignorance in the future.  Thank you.",-0.1604,253

What a powerful message behind this beautiful video. Love y'all so much ❤️,0.9122,15
"What's your point? Comparing some vandalism to racists? Oh wow - that's one clever point. Not. And just you know - real Americans helped us get rid of Nazis, thanks for that. If your forefathers knew how you'd think about the right-wings in your country now they would roll in their grave. Real Americans are people that cherish the first ammendment not attack it. They cherish the freedom of press not condemn it. They cherish the freedom of expression - don't try to stop it. Real Americans? How real are people that don't care about how the country was build - by immigration & freedom of religion. Real Americans - that's laughable. Wannabe Nazis are what you are.",0.9813,132

"Wow. You liberals are children. I am a black, lgbt person who supports Donald Trump. You are acting like hes killing us. He isn't. If you would listen to the damn man and stop listening to what is literally fake news you would know where his beliefs fall. This video and song are nothing but propaganda against white people and men. And that's why you idiots hate our president. Because hes a white man. He did nothing to you. Hes only improved the country. Read. Do research. Stop listening to lies from the networks that the democrats paid off to promote hillary and bash trump. You dont care about the truth because it makes republicans look good. It does so well and it should. I wasn't even a republican until i started thinking for myself and doing research. Thats the beauty of not being a mind slave. Obviously you dont care about free thinking. And way to lose a fanbase because of your radicalism. The only reason i listened to you is because one of your songs were remixed by someone else and it lead me to discover that song machine. You are a terrible group and i hope you see the problems youve caused once you lose fans and stay d list singers or what the hell ever you are. Also, pepe is a meme, you are demented.",-0.9399,255

"Yes look at UC Berkeley but look away when white people shoot their own. Perfect illustration of how 'Whataboutism' works - well done. You have inhaled Trump's policy hook line and sinker. Maybe one day you will actually realize what happens in your country. Maybe. Maybe not. From a person that lives in a country where this politics have caused a War, millions of deaths and people wondering how this could happen I can only hope that we won't see that ever again. And thus i applaud Misterwives for spreading their message.",0.8381,103

You know who are 'real American people'? The people your moronic leader called 'Pocahontas'. Those are the only real American people. You are just immigrated Europeans that had to or wanted to leave the continent. Yeah the truth sucks.,-0.4404,48

come on people!!! it the story of moses and the ten commandments! after moses leads the jews out of egypt they are roaming around the desert and the jews ask moses to go and find out what God wants from them so he goes up a mountain and talks with God for a few days when he comes down with the ten commandments the jews have already erected a golden calf and are worshiping it as a god and god almost destroys them then and there. its literally a story littered through pop culture. seriously i get that not everyone goes to church in their lives but something you need to understand is that in pop culture whenever there is any kind of symbolism more then half the time its biblical.,0.5211,138

"relevance is an act of political fluency. their goal is to stay relevant. all political art is not great art and all great art is not political, and art will always be judged by the time and place it was made. so i feel as if an artist claims theyre apolitical, i feel as though they have already lost the battle. an audience is more damaged and betrayed by void rather than substance",-0.958,79
