"Haha awesome interview. And what caught my interest is the fact that curse words are actually in their essence, just words. It‚Äôs how people use them that change their meaning, and context. Like in this interview it‚Äôs totally used as a humor device. And a way to connect with people. I know there are arguments on both sides. I‚Äôm not saying we should be teaching kids this stuff; but they are gonna find out anyway and we aren‚Äôt making it any better for them by labeling it as strictly bad (as shown by censoring it here). Children should be educated on when and how to use words like this as any other word they learn. Now, I didn‚Äôt start out thinking I‚Äôd be advocating for this haha but I was just caught by the humor of it. So I‚Äôm sorry but if anything censoring only takes care of a symptom. You can make any word into something vulgar and condescending. So it still amazes me that they are still beeping this stuff out. They are just making us say it in our heads instead of saying it themselves and denoting it to the public that it is labeled a bad word. And kids learn at a young age what is good and bad. So us labeling it as bad makes it so  ‚ÄîNot that it is inherently bad. Human nature is getting in its own way; trying to avoid something leads back to itself. Lol. This is just a thought I felt like sharing since it‚Äôs so crazy how television works. At the time 3 was allowed and now I think it‚Äôs what 5-10?  It‚Äôs implied that rules are forever changing based on societies readiness when all there is is the moment now. We‚Äôre only making it harder by including time. because time is just a construct. (And yeah I know I‚Äôll probably get a comment stating what have you been smoking. Lol. Good one. But it‚Äôs time to wake up or at least laugh like I am that we are still binding ourselves to outdated notions). If anything kids get curious; they say it anyways at one time or another and it‚Äôs a performing language that releases stress aka when you stub your toe. Wow this was long.",0.9874,446
