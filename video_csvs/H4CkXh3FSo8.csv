"As someone who works with cameras I can quite safely say that cameras don't lend themselves to racism regardless of their origin. A good photographer will correctly be able to capture color and know what tones of light to use to correctly capture someone's skins tone. That's all it is and no I'm not disregarding their experiences with bad photographers,  I'm saying cameras,  especially cameras now,  are not racist. These people are all gorgeous all shoot amazingly but it's important to remember that some taking a bad photo of you isn't your fault or prejudiced again your skin colour,  they just don't understand their craft well.",-0.1098,114

The reason why Kodak starting changing their film to work for darker complexions had nothing to do with brown and black people. It happened because companies that made wood furniture complained that it was impossible to capture the differences in wood tones from one type of wood to another and their ads didn't look as good as they could because of that. It just also benefited black and brown people. Sad but true!,0.0999,77
