"CGI can look very realistic these days, so we cannot know for sure if this is real or not. I think landing a rocket would in fact be easier on a flat and stationary earth than on a spinning globe. But if the earth is flat and stationary there is no space and no reason to make rockets go into space, so if the earth is flat it makes more sense that they would simply make CGI animations instead of real rockets landing.

If the earth is a spinning ball hurling through space, it is very impressive that they are able to fly these rockets into space, return them back into the atmosphere, landing at this small landing platform while the earth is moving 60000 mph through space and spinning on its own axis at 1000 mph at the equator.

It would be interesting to see how the rockets adjust their speed and trajectory when they go from space and back into earths atmosphere again. Even more impressive: at some point they need to upend the rocket around above the landing platform so that the thrusters point down. Before they enter the atmosphere they need to factor in the earths rotation in order to land on the correct location on the spinning ball earth, and gradually as the rocket comes into the atmosphere the drag of the air starts to grab the rocket so that it eventually moves along with the air relative to the earths surface just like an airplane, but this is a gradual process since the atmposhere is very thin in the upper layers and becomes more dense as they get closer to earths surface. This sounds very difficult, maybe it is easier to just make CGI?",0.6088,307

For all the Children who are Ruined by shame 
Mirror child
The image of a precious dove
Dancing barefoot on the beach
Drinking in love and sunshine
full of smiles 
never having to die.
 
Mere child 
Dreaming awhile on a school title 
Learning to carry books for miles. 
Crayons, pencils, stencils 
Nothing you need to do
but Sing and carry the wind on Your wings.
 
Mirror child
Like daddy or mommy
Carrying so many burdens
for A little person
All the time
 
Not able To catch the spies and Spiders. 
Go back to the skies, 
Little dove
And play with the eagles 
who tamed this land 
Until you are a spirit so good and pure
That you will truly guide 
the directions of our 
Bloodied hands.
 
Temptations of Evil 
Muscles of Clay,
Eyes of pitifully empty bliss,
Teeth of dragons never begotten, 
You stand alone 
Praying to brainless demons
Praising power empty Of Spirit, 
Goodness or Hope. 
 
You shall reap no Glory
But only Mortal death 
and baptized Shame
So as to Die without Jesus 
Or any Holy Name. 
 
Stained by lust,
Broken tears and stardom,
Born of evil and deviltries
Ill conceived 
Raise Your Heart to God Jesus
and The Holy Spirit,
And He will Remove Your Pain, 
Stop your foolish self destructive reign,
And bring you Spiritual Relief 
You could never possibly or individually 
Humanly gain.
 
To Have Peace, Love 
And Eternal Happiness and Justice

Believe in Jesus,
The Son of Mary and God, 
And You Will Be Immortally
Saved For ever more,

When there are currently cities like NYC scattered all over the darkside if the moon the side earth never sees. But china russia and the USA corporation know exactly what and how ,and there are many under ground cities on the moon. 
     Uhm by the way earth is loaded with underground bases for thousands of years. Look that up.
  Rockets ? Rockets no matter how good they go up and down is not 
Anywhere near ,new technology. They are mining asteroids and have for 30plus years with rockets that do just what these do. They are not for transport of people. Dont let them dazzle you with smoke and mirrors like a modern man helocopter landing in a remote jungle , native people living like the have since time began , showing off his cell phone his watch his helocopter.
Dont buy this rocket tech they are hiding the free energy systems.
They use and have been using for over 50 years in space. The majority of the craft in space us ion motors that run on air.
 Do you think there are gas stations on planets .Do you think fuel as we use on earth will have any roll in space travel???
Do you think recovered ET craft around the worl d crash on earth cause they didnt fill up at the last space exit where they sell space craft gas?
No they have ion motors the convert air in to energy they dont carry or store fuel.They create energy and create electromagnetic ripples and waves to propel them selves thru space.
Why the secret space program is SO secret is only because, they would have to show the world free energy technology they have .
Free energy would end slaery of the people of the globe round the world.

"The theory of evolution is not a scientific theory - it's not even science. Science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational Creator so that it can be studied and understood. This is why it flourished in Christian Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as people started to question Aristotelian dogma. Francis Bacon, father of the scientific method, was a devout believer of the Bible, as was Galileo, Kepler, Pascal and the great physicist Isaac Newton (who wrote more about the Bible than science). There were many, many more, including the mathematicians Leibnitz and Euler, and Faraday, Morse, Pasteur (who showed that life can only come from life - The Law of Biogenesis that every biologist learns), Kelvin, and Maxwell. There are also many, many PhD scientists today that state publicly their belief in God, and even more who believe in God but are afraid to say so because of fear of attacks from ignorant bigots.",-0.8198,186
