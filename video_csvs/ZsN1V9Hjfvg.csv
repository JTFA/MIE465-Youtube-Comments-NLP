"Drop the audience guys. The show felt as n intimate conversation of people from the same field of work that just happens to be done in front of a camera. It was a different format than talk shows and that's what made it interesting.

With an audience, it feels like a more regular TV show and it might eventually turn into another version of some talk show we see a million times ever. The people sitting around the table will be naturally more guarded or will subconsciously feel the need to involve the audience or play to it somehow.

Why is there an audience? No one was asking for an audience so It's puzzling Hollywood Reporter why you would include an audience.

"Why the hell would THR put in a live audience again? Who the heck asked for that or that that was a good idea?
