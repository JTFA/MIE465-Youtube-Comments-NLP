"I enjoyed your video.  I few comments from my experimentation with making  items via glass fusing.  

If you read about making items via glass fusing, they will tell you to coat every surface in your kiln with kiln wash before its first use to insure that glass spills do not ruin your kiln.   If you are very careful to never touch the coated surfaces, the kiln wash will survive several firings.  However, eventually you will need to re-coat the kiln. 

I found it absolutely necessary to recoat the kiln shelves before every use.  The same was true for molds. The glass would always pull the kiln wash of the shelf, leaving spots with no kiln wash.  If I were to use the shelf a second time without recoating it, the glass would stick on the places left bare.  When you scrape the used kiln wash off the shelf, insure you are wearing a respirator.  You do not want to inhale any of the powder.   Also wear a respirator any time you are spraying a shelf or mold with kiln wash. 

Kiln paper can be used if you have money to burn and do not like coating your shelves with kiln wash.  However, just like kiln wash, the kiln paper is suppose to be replaced after every use.

I found that spraying the kiln wash onto the shelf produced a much smoother coating than I was ever able to get by brushing the kiln wash onto the shelf.  The best sprayer that I found was a hand-held sprayer used to spray plants.  It had a built-in pump. You poured your kiln wash into the container, pumped it several times to pressurize the container, then pulled the trigger to spray the shelf.  It made coating the shelf easy and would produce a very even coating.  If the texture of the bottom of your glass sample is not important, applying kiln wash with a brush would be sufficient.

While it is true that hot glass will not stick to graphite, placing a sheet of graphite into a kiln would ruin the graphite.  The extreme temperatures in the kiln would cause the graphite to convert to CO2.  After the first use, any part of the graphite shelf which had not been covered with glass was covered with small pits.  The pit were deep enough that sanding the shelf flat would have taken quite an effort and would also have generated way too much carbon dust.  I was told that replacing the oxygen with and insert gas would eliminate the problem.  Argon was suggested.  I never set up my system to try it. It was easier and less expensive to use kiln wash.",0.9451,489

"I've been making synthetic ruby and sapphire as of recently.  I'm building a Verniuel furnace and I'm thinking the same way about this as you are about getting people into working with glass.  Created ruby and sapphire is actually incredibly simple and easy.  Growing the boule past infancy is the difficult part, but making small starter boules can be accomplished with a MAPP/Oxy torch.  Using Al2O3 combined with 1% - 3% Cr2O3 yields ruby.  

Sapphire is a lot more difficult to achieve the rich blue color normally associated with blue sapphire.  I found using iron (II) oxide and not iron (III) oxide with titanium dioxide in a 3:1 ratio is a good dopant formula for adding to the alumina.  Mix the oxides in an oxygen free atmosphere--CO2 works perfectly well here.  The latest test batch I made last night is a larger scale follow up to a batch I experimented with over this past weekend.

You mentioned you used 555timer and some kinda capacitor and resistors. 

Will you send me schematics or how-to-build instructions?

I use 3000volt 4000peak amperage capacitor rated at 100-200micro-farad.
And my cap charger is so weak that it takes almost 30seconds to fully charge my cap. So I am really curious about the 555chip is applicable for triggering my thyristor and capacitor at fully charged state. 
If there is another better option to take, please help me.

 A few questions for you
   Where are you taking the  Materials Engineer course? (friends Son Wants to become a  Materials Engineer)
It seems to me that your pouring your sample on to a relatively cool (ie it isn't red hot) piece of Stainless
waiting until the glass cools then anneal the sample
Is that what your doing?

It sounds like your  using the Stainless like a Marver table (ie big freaking piece o metal used by glassblowers to shape their gathers before doing the major shaping)

I'm just trying to understand what your doing because it is counter to my experience as a glassblower
(at least 15 years as Lampworker in soft glass and boro, fused glass and studio glass)

"looks a lot like ceramics glazing even in the formulas. you should look at Daniel de Montmollin's book about glazing. 
actually you could try to make a uv sensitive glaze !  
As well you could make your own melting dishes buying porcelene, just modeling the clay with your fingers to make a bowl. Then it's possible to fire it with the pouder in it without having to make it bisk. 
You can put some alumine pouder on top of your kiln floor, that's how potters do to prevent glaze from sticking the floor. as well they use some heat resistant tripods like thoses : http://www.ceradel.fr/fr/arbre-trepieds-gazettes-echelles/1800-trepieds-refractaire.html",0.7901,112

"what about using induction rather than an expensive heating element??
if course you'd need a decent induction material to melt glass in, but I feel it would be cheaper than some super expensive kiln ;)

to add a DIY kiln seems harder to do than a DIY induction furnace.

"you know, ive kind of worried about those laser points that claim to be 5mw, but arent. if someone doesnt know what they're getting, they could do some real damage to themselves or others. i'm not saying a regular 5mw isn't dangerous in and of itself, but someone accidentally blinding their cat or something with a ""5mw"" laser pointer or giving themselves eye damage from a deceptively labeled laser rubs me the wrong way. people should know what theyre getting, especially if it's dangerous.

unrelated, but who even makes and sells these? it seems like something that could be a legal issue.",-0.5906,116
