It amazes me that focus pullers like Chloe can make every single shot tack sharp with no viewfinder using only a knowledge of maths and lens/light physics. It's crazy that she can look at a subject 10m away and know that the lens is at 100mm and know on a moment by moment basis the exact number to turn the dial to on the fly to get a perfectly crisp shot. There's zero room for error with focus pulling as it's one of the only things that can't be fixed in post-production. mad respect 🙌🏻,0.5859,101
It's been 9 videos long Mr. Brown. It's  nice to see your vlogs again.,0.4215,17

"Watching these vlogs about the Audi brings back so many memories for when as an international model I did several car and even tyre commercials in countries like Mexico and South Africa etc with big production teams, and usually always with great catering companies so that everyone eats well. Ja lekker! And Ben, while you are in Cape Town, go check out the Pride of Africa luxury train to Pretoria and Victoria Falls. I am sure you can sell yourself to them which I did also (see my Train Lord video on YouTube that shows this spectacular train and Victoria Falls). You won't regret it I assure you. Keep it up, cheers from a Dutchman Johannes Christiaan",0.9441,128

"its true and undeniably amazing for the most part, you have to be really precise, however she has a monitor to see what the camera is seeing, usually the dop or director's monitor, if you don't have a monitor (rare) then you usually stop down the lens to get a bigger margin of error",0.4019,60
