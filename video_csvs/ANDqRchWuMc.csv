I fucking love Westworld. Such a weirdly perfect combination of two genres I didn't know I needed to see put together.,0.7902,23
"I have seen it, Ill comment below and let you know... Full Spoilers

Westworld immediately grabbed me. After the first few episodes I was invested in this world, I was infested in the players, the hosts, the game, and even the designers. I felt a little shift in tone between episodes 1 and 2, but that's normal for a pilot and the actual series. 

But the show slowed down around episode 7-8 of its 10 episode run.  I felt that the main character had been on their journey for the past 3 episodes with no real resolution, the man in black was doing similar things, while the only real story progression was with the character Meave. Perhaps it was the fact that I didn't like her story-line, it felt un-fulfilling compared to the others. I felt like she was there simply as a story conceit to keep the audience involved with the town of Sweetwater. I didn't buy the whole 'hacking' her code, and we never get an answer to why she was doing these things. 

However, the show made up for these faults with the 1-2 punch of the last few episodes. Not only was I asking myself, 'what is consciousness?' or 'what is free-will'...I was asking myself, 'Who is a Host and Who is real?!' Was really good stuff for the climax of the season, and got me amped for season 2.

"hm, unpopular opinion here: still think westworld isn't a particularly good show. Yes, the actors are all great, the visuals and setting are great. Even the underlying themes of conciousness etc. But what about the story and characters? It seems most people don't have this problem but I had no character I cared about. (originally I now listed the main Characters and why they lacked motivation and why I didn't get invested in them, but that was getting long and for most people probably not very interessting) Generally the only one you could get invested in was the former prostitute, everyone else was too mysterious (we don't know why they do what they do - which is fine for support characters but don't fill the main character we are suppose to be invested in slot) or they motivations are just very weak for the majority of the show, they are just along for the ride, just dicking around. But even with the prositute I lost interest when the two workers at westworld just totally let her do whatever she wanted. Wipe her memory! Didn't work? Report her! Don't want to because of repercussions? Destroy her or just quietly send her back, do anything instead of making her super smart and letting her control you like puppies... that was so stupid it broke the only working story line. 
So I don't think it was a bad show, especially since it look so dam good and the premise was interesting, but it was very good either 6/10, weak 7/10 in my opinion.",-0.8702,290
