"Adam Heida Southrons (Haradrim) were more of an analogue for Arabs/Persians instead of ""black"". There are ""black men out of Far Harad"", but they're only mentioned once when they were seen at the Battle of Pelennor Fields. The men of ""Near Harad"" and the men of ""Far Harad"" are not actually the same people.

As for Easterlings, they were never mentioned to be Asians... they were said to be short, broad, and swarthy. To me that sounds more like Greeks or Turks, something along those lines.

There are others though. There are the men of Forodwaith, who live in the far northern wastes and are unrelated to the Edain, though not much else is said about them. There are the Druedain, who are described as a forest-dwelling Pygmy type of tribe (though not sure about their skin color). There are the hill-men of Angmar, barely anything is mentioned about them.",-0.2854,183

"Flop Scratch
The only time i saw a black knight is in Black Knight (2001) with Martin Lawrence, honestly if the writers make it so it makes sense then im okay, historical is one thing, but in fantasy where so much is possible, it shouldn't be a problem to jump on a boat and sell ingredients etc with each other or have mercenaries with specific different armor, i only ever saw black knights in games where the player equips it himself (e.g WoW).
Luckily Baranor in Shadow of War made sense the way it was written and not him just being there because.

"" I don't want a black person in the series. Not that I'm being racist it's just not sticking to the story. It's how tolkein would have wanted it. And tolkein was a British pompous ass who was a racist anyway.""

But Tolkien didn't wanted it because it was bad, but because he wrote it that way and was a racist. Saying you are not racist and then proceeding with that explanation, im not buying it.

Darker-skinned people where referenced in Tolkien's books...just referenced though.  People just like to not mention it. The Haradrim.

In black panther are white people there is no fiction where there is only one group of people, except for eastern films and some western ones, but Lord of the Rings is grand-scale, i dont expect to see a squadron of knights that are black, that's just weird. I bring the mercenary example up as much as you do with the knight one. The way Game of Thrones does it is good.",-0.9836,303

Well at least it's a new story and not a remake,0.2732,11
Well since they do have access to the silmarillion this time they have a lot of stories they can cover.,0.2732,21
"Well thank god they aren't ""remaking"" the films through a TV series. Because that would have been fucking stupid. 

Make a TV series and tell new stories set in the Rings universe. So glad it turned out this way.",0.6486,45

"While stories from The Silmarillion are preferable to stories based on Appendix sidenotes from ROTK (which is what I'm forseeing), Christopher Tolkien holds the rights. You would have to pry them from his cold, dead hands.

All we know is that it will be a ""prequel"" to LOTR, which points me to LOTR Appendix events. If it HAS to be set in the Third Age, then a series following ""Strider"" (hey, not a bad name for a TV Series) and his escapades around Middle Earth:
- His early years in Rivendell after his father's death
- Joining the Dunedain as their Chief and protecting The Shire (their removal from the ROTK film will lose , context to their importance sadly)
- His friendship with Gandalf
- Serving under Rohan and Gondor (there's a whole battle in Umbar)
- The relationship between him and Arwen, and her taking the Gift of Men and promising her marriage with Aragorn
- His travels through Moria and Harad
- End it with the Search for Gollum

Covers a lot of familiar characters (Aragorn, Elrond, Arwen, Gandalf, Galadriel, Thranduil and Gollum) but I do feel like it's not the most interesting set of events in Middle Earth for a whole show. Also a lot of ""fan fiction"" would be required to fill in the gaps. Could be done well ... but I'm doubting it. And even what is suggested above would require a HUGE television budget, having to cover so many different parts of Middle Earth.

Honestly, I'd prefer The Silmarillion. Even just The Tale of Beren and Luthien could cover a really awesome mini-series.",0.9542,309

"Yes you're right that it's not 100% the fault of PJ about how The Hobbit turned out, but a large part of it is. If you watch a lot of the behind the scenes stuff, many of the worst design and story choices were either courtesy of PJ, Fran Walsh, or Phillipa Boyens. Adding Azog, the elf/dwarf romance, Alfrid, all came from PJ and his writing team, and NOT from WB as so many people claim. It was also PJ's idea to turn the story into a trilogy.",0.6097,103

This is a link to my take on the news; I hope the series does well but I can't say I don't have my doubts about it; can it live up to the Original Trilogy? Probably not; but it may surpass the Hobbit at least.

"prepare to be disappointed, the movies version of lord of the ring already a masterpiece. I doubt they'll be able to make it better, in fact I think they'll make such a fuck up ppl just goes back to watch the movies instead. but to be honest,  they should do another book series instead of remaking the old one. look at the success hbo had with game of thrones (a song of ice and fire), new ip is what ppl looking for not remake of old shit thats already fucking amazing.",0.8931,101

"the Silmarillion is a brilliant book however the setting of some of the stories (with the two trees) maybe tedious for some viewers and this may prompt switching so much around to cater for viewers and a potential loss of the essence and symbolism. i do feel this is being made as a reaction to Game of Thrones and such panic production is always dangerous. I had always thought such a project should be experimented via Anime. I hope and pray they just stick to the script, Tolkein was very thorough and i hope they take the editorial corrections that Christopher later pointed out into account. really worried, really excited. fingers crossed",0.5667,121
