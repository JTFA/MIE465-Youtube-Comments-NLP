"As far as I agree when it comes to Anakin/Padme relationship (too much passion, too much control and possessiveness on Anakin's side and submission on Padme's) or even the relation  between Han and Leia (two big-headed, persistent, independent and selfish individuals), Rey and Kylo are slightly different. They both are strong Force users (and excellent warriors) which makes them extra sensitive, they've experienced isolation, rejection, abandonment and they've been both looking for love, acceptance and their overall ""place in all of this"". Their 'relationship' proceeds slowly, starting from hatred and fear, then changing into curiosity and fascination, leading to compassion and understanding. They are still in the process of knowing each other better, learning about their fears and weaknesses. I suppose they are honest with each other when they connect through the force. Kylo's offer of ruling the galaxy together was meant to treat her as his equal, not inferior or superior. He didn't impose a kind of ultimatum on her ""Join me and if you don't, I will kill all you care about"". Is their relationship abusive? I wouldn't say so. They seem to be soulmates having both light and dark side within and potential 'love' between them has a chance to be unconditional - not as obsessive or selfish as in case of the couples before them. Of course on condition that they will both grow up to decide what's best for them.",0.9545,276

"Everything was kind of meh with explanations for me, but I do agree they probably wouldn't have a long-lasting relationship or thing. They might have one instance where their priorities with the force (the only main point I could see because yeah, for like forever, the force has been such a huge factor in these things and if romances work or not. I agree and can see that point) slip and they allow themselves their temptations, romantic or physical (I'd think romantic honestly, just a kiss or something). That's the main thing holding apart in my opinion- their priorities with the forces/their commitment to the dark/light side. When considering this situation with only a short-term relationship or moment, the only thing really holding them back is that- just think about ever other factor, the long-time war (that would only be a problem if it were a long-term relationship), and other things. So really, if something were to happen briefly- it would be with them disregarding the force/their beliefs - which would be huge. I'm not against it, in fact, I think it would be exciting to see something so drastic because their tension and feelings, you can sense, are super intense. So I agree that a long-term relationship wouldn't be suitable for Reylo. But if there were a short term one, despite some risks and sacrifices, then it'd be possible, would make for great drama, and more. I still support Reylo :).",0.9947,284

"I completely disagree with this video. I think the sequel trilogy is arguing for romantic love. Showing that, where family love didn't work, it can bring someone back from the dark side. 
also, when something in storytelling happens 2 times, the third time always proves different. Its the rule of 3's in stories (think Goldilocks and the 3 bears). For example, Kylo doesnt come back the first 2 times, he will the 3rd. It makes things feel complete and is satisfactory to readers. 2 established a pattern, but the 3rd breaks it.

I have a tendency to endorse relationships that I think will be the healthiest, regardless of which ship might be more passionate (but has more of a possibility of blowing up in their faces, and the blast radius taking others with them). Ever since The Force Awakens, I've liked the idea of Finnrey. Finn clearly had (and I believe still has) romantic feelings for Rey, and it was his speech at Maz's castle that made me want them to happen (""And I ran. Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever did."") During Finnrose's kiss, Finn definitely does not kiss back, and is sort of just stunned and confused. So I believe he still likes Rey.

I don't mind Finn being with Rose, they were great together but I don't think their moment was earned yet in TLJ. I have seen some Poe/Rey stuff and it's cute, but it would be super rushed (especially if we see it onscreen) of them being together.

You could hardly get a scene without Finn + Rey and yet people managed to pull Reylo out of their asses. Some Reylo fans even said that Keylo was only jealous of Finn's friendship with Rey, that was why he tried to murder the both of them.

"Reylo is just so wrong in my mind.  It‚Äôs literally an abusive relationship where he tries to manipulate her into staying with him.  It disturbs me that people see abuse as romantic.

He tells her that he‚Äôs the only one who cares about her - that‚Äôs textbook abusive partner behaviour.  And he‚Äôs such a whiny little brat, why do people find that so attractive?  It‚Äôs the same sort of shit we saw in the Twilight saga.

Compare Rey‚Äôs expressions when she‚Äôs talking with Ben/Kylo versus when she‚Äôs with Finn or even Poe.  She‚Äôs so much calmer and happier with the people who care about her.  Sure, there‚Äôs some sexual tension with Ben, but that‚Äôs not the same thing as love.",0.545,156

"Something to consider though is the fact in Ancient Greece women had no agency of their own and were considered inferior to their male counterparts in every single way.

It is not hard to see why the concept of erotic love was seen as a weakness for men and as an unnecessary complication for women. I am not sure it's an interpretation we want to carry forward in contemporary fiction....

"Star Wars isn‚Äôt just based off Greek Myth.. Such bold claims for such poor research.

"The point in that nor Kylo nor Rey is intense darkness or intense light. They are not opposites! They are complimentary! They are growing in a way that they will complement each other which means that their strengths will fill weaknesses. 
For Anakin, the dark side is not more important than her. The problem is that he is dominated by the feelings of the dark side which is fear, distrust, and anger. 
Isn't just in Star Wars that romantic love is not the most important thing. Most people are regulated by their values in life and believe it or not most people don‚Äôt put romance in their five most important values. 

One thing that was completely defined between Kylo and Rey is that he has compassion for her. 
Some might not be sure if Kylo feels romantic love towards Rey but are absolutely sure that he has emphatic feelings toward her since Snoke read Kylo and said that loud and clear, although, everything in his body language shows that he also feels romantic feelings towards her. 

Romantic love might be possessive. Usually, people see their romantic partners as an ownership and that is why there is so much conflict in romantic relationships. That prone for ownership can be balanced with empathy and compassion. 

Kylo and Anakin don‚Äôt love themselves, on the contrary, because they need constant validation from others. They don‚Äôt trust their inner self and their connection to the force. They deposit their worth in the hand of others and that's  what drove them to the Darkside. They confuse fear with respect and that is something that most of us does without knowing.",0.9911,305

Rey feels abandoned bc if her ‚Äúnobody‚Äù parents and Kylo feels abandoned by his parents. And Mark Hamill even says ‚ÄúKylo feels alone and so does Rey‚Äù and so much more. When Kylo says ‚Äúblow that piece of junk out of the sky!‚Äù I think he‚Äôs being reminded of his father, not bc he wants Rey to die.

I don‚Äôt think that they‚Äôll be officially a couple, but there will be a big hint to their relationship in the next movie. To Ben, Rey is special, basically a strength of not to give up.
