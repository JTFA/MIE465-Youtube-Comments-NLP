Best true rookie in the NBA right now (Simmons is RotY tho). Dude can can just flat out score,0.7906,22
Better than Ingram,0.4404,3
Calling him a future hall of famer 15 games in the season is a little much. I get it you want to jump on the bandwagon before everyone else.,0.0772,31

LeBeautiful we don't know how Fultz will turn out yet but the fact that Ainge dropped down to take Tatum AND got the lakers/kings future 1st...that guy knows what he's doing. Tatum is having a massive impact right now at age 19,0.0,47
Leo Martinez its still to soon to be talking about hof. Tatum aint even an allstar yet. Cant be junping to conclusions.,0.0,25
"Leo Martinez itâ€™s all the same to me. Any new bandwagon fan can go back and research college and rookie stats and teams to make it seem like they were a fan the whole time. Hype train, fanboy, all that shit. Calling this kid a future hall a famer is that type of behavior to me.",0.3612,64

Lol heâ€™s not even the 2nd best,0.7906,9
Lol the thumbnail is the dunk he missed,0.1531,8
"Lol. I'm not a ""new bandwagon fan"". I've been watching the  Celtics rigorously since ~2012 and Tatum is extremely polished and proven for a 19 year old. He's been an instrumental piece for us all year and fits perfectly in Stevens' system on both ends of the floor. Future HOF? Sure, maybe a bit of an over-estimation, I'll give you that, but you can't say that Tatum is not the real-deal for his age. Dude plays with the composure of a vet, has an extremely high IQ, hardly ever makes mistakes, and shoots efficiently; along with having the physical tools to take him to the next level. That being said, I reserve the right to call out potential when I see it, so kindly fuck off.",0.8249,147

Russell Westbrook Fan since 2010 Simmons is not a true rookie,-0.0083,11
Russell Westbrook Fan since 2010 his agent shut him down...he could have came back at the end of the year.  Check his injury and the normal time it takes to heal..the math don't add up and no he's not a true rookie. His draft class was last year,-0.6164,54
Russell Westbrook Fan since 2010 yea he should deservedly get rookie of the year but I just mean the dudes who were drafted this summer. Simmons was in the league last year philly just shut him down,0.1655,38

"Those are the 3 best rookies, however, Tatum is the only one that is impacting a very good, well run team, with a potential deep playoff run in their future. BTW, as an aside, I want to kiss josh Jacksons agent on the lips, cuz if the suns had managed that situation differently, we may have ended up with Jackson instead.  An the suns probably would've passed on Tatum because they are stoopid.. Hehe...",0.9165,86
Trevin Whitehead jaylen brown the second option lmao ðŸ˜‚ they donâ€™t use Al Horford as a scoring option he creates offense for everyone else and he shoots when heâ€™s open BI is also a second option so what are we saying here?,0.6124,47
