I hope they don't 'retire' now that they've found their own unique 'voice' as skaters and continue on to the next Olympics: I can see them now creating some wonderfully unique programs.

Third, please stop with the culture thing, we live in America now, our lives are different and there are new opportunities for us youngsters. Don't try bringing us down because of our ridiculous culture stats. That is one of the biggest issues with Hmong nowadays is that the older generations can never accept new ideas and practices. Please stop this nonsense and let them be.",0.0181,95
