Do you know how vitamins work? They can't change the appearance of the hair that's already there! As you ingest them, they can only have an effect on the hair follicles that produce your ""future"" hair. Given the fact that hair only grows 1cm per month, you can't possibly judge whether your hair looks stronger or shinier after 30 days. You would have to take them 6 months at the very least to see if they make any difference at all.
If Safiya's hair looks different, that must be from a different shampoo or conditioner or so",0.2462,115
