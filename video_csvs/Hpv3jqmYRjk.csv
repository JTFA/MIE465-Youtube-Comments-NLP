"I could be wrong, but this is just my impression from watching this several times---I saw Foles going up to players and giving them encouragement and players doing the same to him. They seem like a tight group that really care about each other and respect each other. On the other side, I saw Brady say things like, ""Let's go, boys,"" a couple of times and be completely ignored by his team. Maybe it's just the way the tape is edited, but I didn't see any Patriot player interacting with Brady at all. I think the Eagles were hungrier and more united as a team and it made a big difference. Maybe Brady is close with his teammates, but this video sure doesn't make it look that way.",0.9802,143
