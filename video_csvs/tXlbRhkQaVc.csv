"Billy Graham Death ""A SIGN"" ? ~ The Satanic False Prophets & False Revival EXPOSED - Billy Graham was a Freemason ! He was a puppet for The Jesuits of Rome. He was also known as the ""Protestant Pope."" The false preachers and prophets of the fallen churches of Babylon have been saying that the death of Billy Graham was to be a sign of a ""new revival"". There IS a revival coming, but it is a FALSE one that will preach a FALSE Jesus, to deceive the world into worshipping the beast and Satan. Please seek The Truth ! We do NOT have much Time left ! Read and Study The Scripture for yourself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRwxFbK0I80

Billy Graham (1918-2018) Billy Graham has spent years working towards bringing the Protestant Denominations back under the control of the world churches and Rome. Teaching that there are many ways to God and not just one way like the Bible states is completely wrong! John 14:6 states Jesus is the only way to salvation. There is no other way. I pray that he repented for teaching this doctrine to millions of people over the course of his life. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpGR0A9ooDs",0.4122,215

He knew that he was not the judge. God is the judge (James 4:12). His job was not to expose or condemn others such as Jimmy Swaggert or Jim and Tammy Baker. He knew that he was not there to correct the doctrines of others such as Pope John Paul II. He knew that God is the one who will correct a person's life, not him. He tried to live peaceably with all people (Romans 12:18), Christian and non Christian. He prayed for those in authority (I Timothy 2:2).
