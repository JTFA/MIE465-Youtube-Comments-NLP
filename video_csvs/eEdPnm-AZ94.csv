"....so what were the greatest eras of music again??? Here it is: 2000-2010 sucked straight iron balls with garbage music...garbage hip hop & rap and the rest of the new age Babylonian shit. 

2010-2020 was just qualified as a good music era in my book thanks to the extra shove by Bruno Mars and many other good tracks from other artists. 

*but* the top reigning undisputed eras of ALL TIME were the 50s through the 90s.

If I was forced to pick three then 50s, 80s and 90s for me. All three of those eras were so lit it was surreal. 

My alltime #1 (which would still be a long drawn out battle in my mind) would probably be 90s because of the style and type of music was extreme high energy and authentic, the concentration of talent, the competition between talents which really peaked in the hip hop/rap arena, the music groups (both male and female that were straight legendary) that were put together, the control and freedom the artists still had over their material, the R&B, Alternative, even down to the dresswear.",0.9512,216
