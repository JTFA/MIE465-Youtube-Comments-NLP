"""Crimes committed rank among the most heinous known to human kind?""
Western media told us serbs killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, turns out it was a hostile population of no more than 8000, all fighting age men - all the while serbians were raped and slaughtered, the orthodox cross cut into the bellies of pregnant women. Izetbegovic, so called moderate was a nazi and a jihadist; Croats worse still,  ustase rebranded. ""Kosovars"" attack ancient churches and the world has the audacity to lash out at serbia for behaving how anyone would.
The righteous will not forget what happened to serbia, the day NATO made itself an enemy to the native European, when all our leaders did nothing, when the greatest armies the world had ever known spent their munitions terrorising serbian children.
Khalid sheikh muhammed was a veteran of that war - several hijackers too and they 'fought' for the same side as the Americans.
The chickens came home to roost didn't they? 
You're a fool if you think Mladic's sentence is a good thong for the West.",-0.9855,202
"""He didn't commit genocide. Where is the evidence that Alija or Naser killed kids?"" You want evidence? GO ASK SERBIAN MOTHERS WHICH WERE WATCHING THEIR KIDS DYING IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES AND THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING. How do I know that? Maybe because one of those kids was my family. THAT IS WHY AM I SO MAD.

""How was he defending Serbs?"" Wait, what should he do? Just sit somewhere and watch his people dying? WHEN YOU RAPE SERB CIVILLIANS, AH IT IS OKAY, THAT IS NOT RAPING, THAT IS DEFENDING. But when Serbs do something, IT IS GENOCIDE. Like I said, you are stupid, you don't know ANYTHING about Kravica, Bratunac and Vlasenica, when you learn what happened there, then you can write something.

Muslims USED UN-Safe AREAS TO ROB SERBS' VILLAGES AROUND SREBRENICA. And what would you do at Mladic's place? Again sit somewhere and just watch that and eat popcorns maybe? Well that is not how it works my friend.

And like I said, you are stupid so you don't even know how the war started. For your information it first started in Croatia in OLUJA IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS THAT, if you don't, go and google it. Then it came to Bosnia. In Sarajevo at Serbian Wedding, one Muslim killed one Serb who was at that wedding, FOR NO REASON. That is one of the reasons and maybe the main reason how war started in Sarajevo and then of course it started in whole Bosnia.",-0.9914,294
"""When did I deny that?"" Are you kidding me? Mladic is ""terrorist"" and Oric's intention was to liberate Bosnia from the JNA/Serb forces? Now I'm 100% sure that you are stupid. Alija and Naser killed a lot of Serbian kids, raped them, raped women and old people, if that is what you call liberating Bosnia from the JNA/Serb forces, congrats. On the other side, Mladic was just defending Serbs. You are calling him ""terrorist"" but you know he was actually fighting whole time against them. Mladic's forces drove out a lot of Muslim people in the bus to safe place. Where was Oric when Mladic entered in Srebrenica? He escaped. He did not give a fuck about protecting Muslims. He killed his own people. That is your ""hero"" and Mladic is terrorist of course.",-0.9617,165

"It all comes down to the word reality, and a conflict is made of realities within realities, bubbles of
ethnicities and their realities as they look at the world around them.
........................... This way we clearly see that Ratco Mladic is a symptom of his group /ethnic /bubble reality. And we all know power at the top in socities are very personalty changing, look at Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot and so on.
........................ These persons wanted to deal with a very complex world to make it behave like they wanted it to be, not how it really is! Then you take short cuts, and when you are dealing whith people, hords of them, hundred of thousands, the result is allways tremendous suffering, fear, starvation and if necessarily mass
killings of certain groups.
......................... It is thus a fact that Ratco Mladic is a symptom of his people's group-reality and how they view the world around them. In a way he is more innocent then the society that brought him to power, the masses movement of feelings that ended up with the tragedy Srebrenica.
......................... And the judges in Haag hesitates to end up whith this conclusion because their profession is not filosofi but in the punishment business where you consentrate about the front events not the reason why.
............................. So, in a way all are victoms, but about the Srebrenica killings/massacre, it is not possible for Ratco Mladic to say it all happened without his acknowlege. And if this in fact is the truth, his duty was to punishment the officer responsible, and he did not.
.......................... If you discover that an officer ore more just happens to kill 8000 persons, and you do not dare punishing them, you understand you yourself will get killed if you do.

The conclusion is :everybody are victims in a specific level of the situation, and in other levels they are all guilty, but you can not put whole nations in prison, you do the next best thing, get that officer who ended up doing what he did under the pressure of the circumstances, his nation and his own officers.",-0.982,392

"KiboxX Aha. I know a Croat woman that was from Bileca. She explained how the Serb militaries burned down houses when people were still in them. When it comes to these kinds of conflicts, one has to realise that civilians dying isn't uncommon.

How were the Bosniaks or Croats raping the Serbs?! Karadzic and Mladic could've defended the Serbs by not starting the war in the first place. Why do you think all states INCLUDING Montenegro wanted to leave Yugoslavia(too bad that Kosovo and Montenegro were annexed though)! Because Serbs had the most privilages and everyone else wasn't treated the way they were when Tito was alive. You still haven't answered as to why Serbs couldn't tolerate Bosnia leaving Yugoslavia. What was the main issue?! Was it because they were afraid they wouldn't have the same privilages as when Milosevic was president? 

I find it very ironic how you're defending karadzic and mladic when Karadzic's words to Alija were ''You're taking Bosnia to the same highway hell as Slovenia and Croatia experiences... The Muslim population will go extinct''. What else does this quote mean other than ''We will commit mass genocide and ethnic cleansing until Muslims are gone'' The Serbs had the JNA force with them, the 4th strongest in Europe. What the fuck were the Muslims or Croats supposed to do?! Again: Please refer to using sources.

"KiboxX How does Alija or Oric evem link to fuckinh Jasenovac?!  Alija wanted Bih to have independence from the ridden, hyperinflated Yugoslavia. The overwhelming majority ( Bosniaks and Croats)  voted yes. It was just that, Serbs couldn't accept democracy and started the war.",-0.5684,51
"KiboxX Oric wasn't the only soldier for ARbih, wtf?! He didn't commit genocide. Yes there were Bosniaks that commited genocide, most died and some got convicted. Where is the evidence that Alija or Naser killed kids? On the flipside, there is literally proof of 6 year olds dying during the Srebrenica attack. While all the muslim women and daughters were forced out of Srebrenica to cities like Sarajevo where they would eventually die. 

HOW WAS HE DEFENDING SERBS?! HIM AND HIS THUGS WERE THE ONES STARTING THIS WAR! No shit Naser escaped!! What a ridiculous statement. Him and the UN keepers warned Srebrenica but that didn't mean everyone had the opportunity to leave. Unlike Mladic, Naser didnt attck UN-safe areas. Mladic's intention was to ethnically cleanse aswell as find as many soldiers as possible. Naser Oric was the face of a free Bosnia to the poor Muslims. What did the Muslims have?!  If Naser died it could be a turnaround. It's like killing a leader.

And please tell me again: Why was it acceptable for the Serbs to start this war when the overwhelming majority of the country voted ''Yes'' to leave Yugoslaiva? Are Serbs really that corrupt that they only care about themselves?",-0.9755,236
"Kiboxx What? When did I deny that?! But what exactly did Alija do? Naser Oric killed people, no shit. However unlike the terrorist Mladic, Oric's intention was to liberate Bosnia from the JNA/Serb forces, Mladic's intention was to literally ethnically cleanse the Bosniaks and Croats. And Alijas intention wasn't to wage war, it was simply to give Bosnia independence. 

Not only that but it is very ironic how you mention Kravica since, when the Muslims attacked in 1993 only 10 innocent people died and 35 soldiers died. While Kravica in 1995 happened against Bosniaks and over 1k innocent people got killed. It is pretty obvious that most of the time, Serbs that got killed in the bosnian war were soldiers.

Not only that but are you ignoring all of the Croat and Bosniaks killed because of the RS? You mention Vlasenica but you forget the Zaklopaca massacre.",-0.9901,167

"Kosovo is Serbia - Ask any historian


""Kosovo is Serbia"", ""Ask any historian"" read the unlikely placards, waved by angry Serb demonstrators in Brussels on Sunday. This is rather flattering for historians: we don't often get asked to adjudicate. It does not, however, follow that any historian would agree, not least because historians do not use this sort of eternal present tense.

History, for the Serbs, started in the early 7th century, when they settled in the Balkans. Their power base was outside Kosovo, which they fully conquered in the early 13th, so the claim that Kosovo was the ""cradle"" of the Serbs is untrue.

What is true is that they ruled Kosovo for about 250 years, until the final Ottoman takeover in the mid-15th century. Churches and monasteries remain from that period, but there is no more continuity between the medieval Serbian state and today's Serbia than there is between the Byzantine Empire and Greece.

Kosovo remained Ottoman territory until it was conquered by Serbian forces in 1912. Serbs would say ""liberated""; but even their own estimates put the Orthodox Serb population at less than 25%. The majority population was Albanian, and did not welcome Serb rule, so ""conquered"" seems the right word.

But legally, Kosovo was not incorporated into the Serbian kingdom in 1912; it remained occupied territory until some time after 1918. Then, finally, it was incorporated, not into a Serbian state, but into a Yugoslav one. And with one big interruption (the second world war) it remained part of some sort of Yugoslav state until June 2006.

Until the destruction of the old federal Yugoslavia by Milosevic, Kosovo had a dual status. It was called a part of Serbia; but it was also called a unit of the federation. In all practical ways, the latter sense prevailed: Kosovo had its own parliament and government, and was directly represented at the federal level, alongside Serbia. It was, in fact, one of the eight units of the federal system.

Almost all the other units have now become independent states. Historically, the independence of Kosovo just completes that process. Therefore, Kosovo has become an ex-Yugoslav state, as any historian could tell you.

"The hero of sick and evil times. Unfortunately, we live in a system worse than it was created by George Orwell, and the people who defended their own people and their own country from monstrous killers, are marked as genocidal, fascists, radical nationalists - typical liberal logic, although what happened in Srebrenica is not a genocide in the legal term, but everyone will say that was indeed a genocide because the reason is destroyed by one imposed authority, in which the western media play the big factor.

Those who continue to wage wars thousands of miles from their territory, stealing natural resources, expelling and killing people in their own countries where these resources are located, are presented as the bearers of peace and democracy. Those who exterminated a whole civilization, who committed a real genocide for which they have never been found guilty, today condemn others for genocide. The United Nations that falsified the statistics and crushed all further research in the territory that is saturated with depleted uranium from which children die from leukemia and cancer are the same UN that determined the number of people killed in Srebrenica.

Anyway, no women and children were killed in Srebrenica. Islamic soldiers, including imported mujahedin from Saudi Arabia, fought against Serbs and killed civilians in surrounding villages. Naser Orić massacred children on the greatest Christian holiday and he was released from this court. Those who killed Serbs did it under the protectorate of the United Nations. Canadian general, Lewis MacKenzie who worked for the same United Nations, wrote two books about it, and publicly said that mathematics and logic simply do not support the number of 8000. People who were killed in Srebrenica are actually soldiers armed to the teeth who killed civilians in the surrounding towns of Srebrenica, and these soldiers were killed in years of fighting. The corpses of the killed soldiers from the surrounding places were dragged and thrown into a mass grave to turn out as if they were all collectively killed in the genocide.

My dear General, we have learned who our enemies are, but you believed your own people and gave your freedom for them, and they sent you to this court that operates without any legal foundation, that serves those who tried to exterminate us, now they judge you ...",-0.9982,423

Serbs didnt want 70% of the territory, according to agreement Serbs would have cantons where their majority was.",0.7939,76

"vampy 97 How can you say that as many Serbs got killed as Muslims did? Out of the 200k killed or went missing (most likely killed but whatever) 105k were Bosniaks, 60k were Croats and 40k were Serbs. Sure, I'm not saying that all Muslims or Croats killed were done by Serbs but Serbs did cause the majority of both the Muslims and Croats to get killed. The Serbs had backup from the JNA army. There is a reason NATO switched sides during the war. 

The thing with Wikipedia is, it has changed its policies quite a lot. You can't write bullshit anymore you need actual sources.",-0.9707,119
"vampy 97 Is that why NATO helped the Serbs in the beginning? 
People don't normally hate Serbs because of a war but.. look at this comment section. So many Serbs call this man a hero. It would be like being a German and calling Hitler a hero.

With the other ones I assume you mean Naser Oric and Alija Izbegotevic. The reason why Alija didn't get any punishment is because his actions weren't made to hurt anyone. Mladic's was. Naser Oric didn't hurt innocent people nor did he burn down villages or commit genocides, again: Mladic did.",0.9446,108
