"On April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a Bible opened to John 3:16 and that ""John 3:16"" was written on his forehead in ink. The notes reportedly said he was entering the ""timeless realm"" and would see his family in heaven. Shampoo was found covering the floor, cardboard was under the cell door to make it difficult for someone to enter, and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God, with the word Illuminati written in capital letters underneath.",0.4404,107
