"Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong
I see the mouths are open but I can't hear the song
I've done my best to fill 'em
But the cracks are starting to spread
Hey, I won't blame you baby
Go on, turn your head

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

I can't keep pretending this next stop isn't mine
The truth is on the table, and someone's gotta sign
I've done my best defending
But the punches are starting to land
I'm sliding into something
You won't understand

Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

So I'm handing you a memory
I hope you understand
That steadily reminds you
Of who I really am

This city's always breathing
I wish that it would die
The king rags and the bachelors
The fever for the velvet rope
The money from my mother's men
I'm not like her, you're not like them

I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb

Oh but don't you give up on me (don't you give up, don't you give up)
Don't you give up on me (don't you give up, don't you give up)

"Hi, I dont mean to be such a pedantic. but on 3:41 theres a slight changing on the exposure/grading perhaps due to transitions effect. I hope the editor didn't just see that and say 'that'll do, no one will notice', cause that would be a let down to the exceptionally great MV from The Killers.",0.2936,65

"[Intro]
Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut

Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong
I see the mouths are open, but I can't hear the song
I've done my best to fill 'em, but the cracks are starting to spread
Hey I won't blame you baby, go on turn your head

But don't give up on me
