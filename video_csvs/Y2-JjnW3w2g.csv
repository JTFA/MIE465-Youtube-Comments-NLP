"Americans play British ppl all the time and visa versa. Rarely do ppl seem to complain (unless their accent is unforgivably horrendous). I get it, there are not as many acting roles available or accessible to actors of color in Hollywood, but it's not a big deal if an American Indian actor plays an Indian person. 
I don't expect films to be accurate about anything, that's what documentaries are for. I don't understand why ppl demand certain levels of realm or representation in films. I just want a good entertaining story. To be honest I don't even care about white-washing or race bending either way. Unless you are claiming to be telling a completely true story about real ppl, you could have blue Russians for all I care. Do ppl honestly feel that American films even accurately portray real life, history, or culture in America? Movies are romanticized or exaggerations of the real thing. 
Benedict Cumberbatch is a Brit and played Dr. Strange, an American doctor. Don Cheadle is an American who played a Rwandan hotel manager in Hotel Rwanda; Idris Elba is a British actor who has played an African warlord in Beasts of no Nation and Nelson Mandela (a South African President)... The list goes on. These are great actors who put on great performances, and 2 of these films are even based on real ppl and real events, not make believe stories. But somehow, pretending to be fake ppl from a different culture is offensive. It's fine if a film as a whole is not enjoyable to you, but to get offended is giving something so insignificant, way too much weight on your heart. Just move on, and watch or do something appealing to you. Let's not make a controversy or big deal out of it.",0.9793,336
"And yes, there is a Marvel bias. Because they set a template that people like and it became the most popular and successful superhero template out there, they do get a lot of passes on many things that WB gets shat on. Its just the way it is. Like a WoW ""clone"" comes out, which might not be a WoW (world of warcraft) clone but is similar enough. It will get compared to the more popular and agreed standard, what is good feels like a copy, what is different feels wrong, and if it is on par with WoW, its not good enough since it for some reason ""has to be better"". Sorry, but that is the unfortunate truth of human idiocy, I mean nature. Marvel set the agreed standard, and they get away with a lot of stupid shit people don't even notice but whine about in WB.

Also, the prequel would allow for creative freedom while still remaining relevant to the overall universe, yet remain unladen by the burden of that later story. Think Wonder Woman.

Ummm. No, you bleeding idiots, the film is in fact shitting on Americans and it shows how the Japanese affect and change Tom Cruise and influence him to live in a completely different way. THEY influence the American out of him, not HIM the Japanese out of them.

The Last Samurai is both plural and singular, all the Samurai that fought to protect their tradition, and the singular as well, chief of them that done harakiri are THE LAST SAMURAI, and how his story influenced the Emperor into remembering / honouring, their ways and culture.

Tom Cruise was just the messenger, and it was also a social statement on how many times we humans neglect our own culture, and a foreigner taking interest in it can remind us how important it is.

Now who is racist? ""Ooooh there is a WHITE in a film around our culture! NO!""

"For my stances on JL movie we can somewhat say a majority of people thought the cgi was bad a good portion of times, how the shots from scene to scene were not handled well, and how short the movie was when it should have been longer. However that said story-wise it was good imo.

Stepphenwolf from the comic book stand point he is NOT really that powerful. Quite frankly he is one of the most weakest new gods there is. Even then movie stepphenwolf is very powerful in his own right and does defeat the Amazons pretty much without breaking a sweat. However what people forget is that as generic as it seems he gets his objectives done. He obtains all three mother boxes and commences to transform the planet. He doesn't care about if you have a family or not, and is the one that does the executions himself rather than let someone else do it. When he fights Wonder Woman is is no surprise that he may be struggling a bit because Wonder Woman 100 years ago beat Ares the god of war.....she was stated in the interviews and in the promotions to be DC's BEST FIGHTER. Did lots of people forget about that? Not to mention this has ALWAYS been a problem with doing super hero teams ups in which ""how do we balance out these characters so that not one character is left out because this hero might be more powerful, faster, etc"" 

There was backlash to how Wonder Woman felt not being very powerful as she previously saw in her film. But when you have someone like Superman who has displayed more pure power in his fight with Zod in Man of steel from destroying Metropolis, to taking the fight to outer space, and then back to metropolis. Then compare his strength feats to easily pulling a large cargo ship, to saving a spaceship from blowing up, etc there is clearly a gap between Wonder Woman and Superman. Even in the comics Superman has shown to best wonder woman 9/10 times when he holds back and when he doesn't it is over in a few seconds.

It is jarring that there is more high expectations for DC heroes than there is to Marvel's for fans and even audiences expect superman to be powerful, but also wonder woman, have batman be the ""gothem demon"" he is, to how the flash is the fastest man alive etc. If for one moment someone out does the other superhero there is a outcry to it but in Marvel you don't see it as much as you do in DC. That is an annoyance for it causes the staff, and directors to film a certain scene to which if this character who is known to be overpowered outdoes someone who is not their equal then it falls upon the staff and director because no matter what they are doomed to fail. You can say ""well marvel found a way to do it"" but nobody points it out in the first avengers movie and even in the second one since at the time their villains were not called into question beforehand. It was simply just that.

Heck if we really want to get technical Brainiac, darkseid, war world/Mongol, Lex Luthor, Mr.P (for short) have all been defeated by Superman, sometimes with help but other-times he does it on his own.  But they are considered to be the Justice Leagues most powerful/dangerous villains. And we want to see them in the movies but we all know superman can take them all out on his own. Once Flash discovers his abilities we know he can solo a majority of them, and without the others around Wonder Woman can shine. However this just can't work with the way things are. just like how there are some that complained that batman got shafted in this movie because he was useless. Well yeah that is the point of it for he can't fight stepphenwolf, he can't fight superman if superman just isn't wanting to hold back, and if he is not prepared.  He can only so much for he is human and not a mixture of different races with special powers, extra inhuman strength or is a alien with powers. In fact Ben's batman is by far displaying the best batman we have seen again in this movie for this is the batman we know can't do much of this for there are always large debates to WHY does the league keep him around, and why do they let him go on these missions to which are no place for batman?

Overall I enjoyed Justice League for they acted as a team, it was nice to see them settling into themselves more rather than just be ""perfect"" in the eyes of the people since I am hearing ""FINALLY A SUPERMAN THAT SMILES"" well i was fine if he didn't smile for he is torn between two ideals that his father and earth father told him about. He is ""human"" in the aspect that he has wants and desires but does he need to be accepted by this world? This all takes flight in Justice League for he has FOUND a way to balance his needs and be a superhero for the people of earth. It isn't so much about his sacrifice but rather how he is showing care now that others are stepping up to be superheroes like him.",0.9652,992

"Hello John from Kitchener Ontario :) I respectfully disagree with the adjusting for many variables. Gaming, theatre costs etc. are all subjective. However, inflation is a quantifiable fact.  Nothing subjective about it. The only other non-subjective argument could be # of tickets sold but then the population has increased so it becomes subjective lol. Adjusting for inflation is fair and realistic. If 1 million people see JL and 900,000 saw the Empire Strikes back it does mean that JL was more successful. However, if JL has fewer people attend but the cost to purchase a ticket has tripled since Empire it does not make JL more successful.",0.9619,119

"I always respect your answers on this John, but I actually have to disagree about the answer (somewhat) to your critics bias question. Now there are obviously some people that scream ""Bias"" ""they're paid off"" etc and I'm not one of those people. But there's a certain level of ""bias"" in every movie review. I'm not saying that all critics are for or against one company or studio or film series. But there are some movie reviewers out there, that just really don't like some studios or don't like certain actors or directors etc. Other reviewers I've followed over the years don't like ""copycat"" movies, and to them many superhero films and sequels are just ""copycat"" films. (now not all these reviewers are going to be certified on say metacritic or rotten tomatoes, but just the fact that there is some bias out there for any individual, its not out of this world to assume that one or two critics (not all obviously) might give one film a bad review based on their personal preferences and not really their objective opinion. It happens just to some fans, we watch a movie as fans and not as critics all the time. I believe maybe some critics will watch some movies as fans and allow that to influence their objectivity, it may be overly positive or overly forgiving for some film's flaws in one review whereas in others that they aren't watching as fans, they are more objective. This is not to say they all do this intentionally though I'm sure there is that one person who does, but they honestly believe in their reviews and sometimes just may unintentionally review a film without their objectivity all set as fans. Some even preview their review by saying its a guilty pleasure or its not great but they still loved it as fan or if you're a fan like me, you will love this etc. 

So I don't believe Critics are biased or paid off, but I do believe that for a at least some critics a little bit of personal preference goes into some reviews that don't necessarily go into others. In that way, there is some bias that exists, just not nearly enough to say that the reviews are all ""rigged"" or ""dishonest.""",-0.7679,427

"I have had the impression that WB's wanted Snyder out anyway so the unfortunate circumstance that led to his departure ultimately worked out the way they were desiring anyway and it's been said that he was already kind of ""out"" well before the announcement came. Really the main mistake was starting off the whole DCEU with Nolan and Snyder, which even when it was announced I felt was a bad idea. The mistake was trying to make Superman into Batman. The mistake was the lousy, clumsy writing of Snyder's Dystopian world. The MISTAKE was making Batman and Superman fight to the death in only the second movie. I could go on and on. One clumsy mis step after another until WW. Unfortunately JLA happened under Snyder's watch so obviously ...mistakes.",-0.9783,143

One of the things I enjoy most about Ben Affleck as Batman is he is imposing physically, like no other Batman before him has been. I would hate to lose that. Ben is 6'4"" and 228 lbs as Batman. Jake was ripped in Southpaw, and bulked up for Prince of Persia, but he is 6' and 170 lbs. Christian Bale was good as Batman, and Jake can be just as good, if not better at acting like the character. You can't act yourself 4 extra inches and add 50+ lbs of muscle. If Jake gets cast I will get behind it because he is so talented. I would also be excited if they cast an up and coming actor with talent who fits the imposing nature of Batman more. Ray Fisher was a relative unknown and I thought he did well as Cyborg.",0.9752,181
"I love Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor, but for this role? I don't think he has the presence.  Both physically and personality wise.

I understand they'll stick with voice changer when in suit, but he still lacks size and presence.

In fact it strips any semblance of Snyder's ambient dark and gritty atmosphere and replaces it with something comical. Which is supposed to make the tone better, but I feel it didnt.

"I think there's another aspect to the box office records and inflation question.  Let's compare U.S. box office numbers on two films, one from 1965, The Sound Of Music, which made $158,671,368 in it's day.  The second film being Titanic (1997), which made $658,672,302 during it's long-winded run.  The average ticket price in 1965 was $1, so we can count roughly 158 million tickets sold for TSOM.  In 1997 tickets averaged at $4.59, that's about 143 million sold for Titanic.  Today, the adjusted gross for Titanic is at $1.209 billion.  When the gross for TSOM is adjusted for inflation it's 5.1% higher at $1.271 billion, and yet it's number of tickets sold is 10.4% higher than Titanic.  This just goes to show you the adjusted box office numbers can be deceptive.",-0.1779,164

"My regards to Thor Ragnarok that I do think that there was turning a blind eye  to the Hela villain and the story overall. She looked great but she wasn't that good. It saw a copy and paste ""daddy issues"" thing again, how we already got those issues with thor and loki. Her attacks were not new that we seen, and she has more powers to show off but she just kept spamming the same attacks. She kept on talking and talking rather than just attack. yes she is powerful and is just showing thor how weak he is but she is the goddess of death. She brought it into the beginning but it falls flat towards the end. Not only that but she was around waaaaaaay longer than thor and loki. She should have KNOWN the hideout where everyone was hiding yet plays it off as she doesn't know where they are all at. Not to mention out of all of her display in power she left the ONE thing that grants her accesses to all the other 9 realms but just leaves it there since NOBODY is stupid enough to take it..... 

Moreover Thor's companions that helped him out in the movie 1 and 2 were killed off without any emotional impact what so ever. Hell Thor doesn't even care about them being dead or the fact it is mentioned. It was not necessary for them to be killed off without thor's reaction showing his pain of loss for those were his friends and it would have added a better character development for Thor.

Now for the Executioner while I loved his character his ""redemption"" moment was the most stupidest thing I have ever seen. 2 M-16's come out of no where in his hands.....just magically does even though we clearly saw he did not have them on him....there was no way he ran all the way back, jumped the broken frost bridge, got his weapons, and then cloaks himself back to get onto the ship in that time frame. 

Loki in the movie was as expected from turning into a anti hero somewhat which marks the end for now of good marvel villains in general until thanos does something great. You can cut the whole hulk out of the movie and it still would have worked for he was not really needed when you look at it. Heck a majority of this film shouldn't really be considered tied to the main story for this was mostly sub stories that ultimately overshadow the main story telling point of what this movie was trying to tell. When Asgard gets destroyed you don't feel sadness, you don't feel ""oh no"" you just feel underwhelm that this movie could have literally ended very early if they cut the whole ""planet hulk"" movie within Thor and him escape the world Thor was on.  

Now granted Thor Ragnarok was fun, enjoyable to watch, and was put together better than Justice League yet from a story wise standpoint it was worse imo than Justice league for it's main villain got his objectives done, the way they made them out to be heroes was worth to see, and how it all came together in the end",-0.9931,586

I mean losing director on what's supposed to be the Big Movie and time limits as opposed to side movies and what not.

Population increase has a lot to do with box office increases over the years also.,0.3182,16
"Props for not just admitting you messed up, but not trying to remove the fact you did. End of the day, yeah, there's a budget, time constraints, and then you have the director/s and artists. I took classes in a media arts and animation degree, and while I didn't quite make it to the Maya stage back in 2008 (damage from hand injuries made it couldn't get past regular fine arts classes that were required), I watched others spending countless others in the computer lab while I was working on 2d animation stuff. So between reshoots and all that, yeah, they likely didn't have the time they needed to finish and yeah, likely blew the budget, especially cause it was how many million just trying to get rid of Cavill's mustache. Basically, it ended up in the same issue as Squad - something happens, and 6 months out suddenly they have to reshoot a bunch of stuff and cobble it back together. And you have characters like flash, their overly CG'd version of cyborg,and the rest of the film. Much as I prefer a blend of practical and CG mostly for enhancement, there's a bunch in this you have to use CGI. And there is a point to be said that yeah, directors should be overseeing it. Animators and the VFX team are the last people I'd blame too.

But as a huge DC fan, yes, if they pushed it back, I'd be disappointed, but if instead they pushed it back say, an extra 6 months, to April/May, if it gets me a better, cleaner, enjoyable JL movie? Do it. Cause there have been moments in all sorts of movies, Marvel included, that the CG makes me cringe and sucks me out of the movie. I mean, BvS just... everything Doomsday. And Marvel the most blatant that with all the movies it sticks out is Age of Ultron there's a shot in the fight when Ultron first comes out with the Iron Legion bots one of those bots look like it's the absolute base unfinished model. There are others, especially with Ironman and War Machine being less hybrid and more full CG, but that one was worse than Doomsday and any of the DC failings.

Marvel, I think they get a tad more leeway because their films overall are enjoyable, but yeah, they seriously have issues with villains that they have rightfully been called out on. Least on the movie side, for the most part I haven't had issues with the Netflix Villains other than 2nd half of Luke Cage and Iron Fist. I may not be a MoS supporter, but Zod was a good villain, though I still prefer Terence Stamp's. And well better than a large chunk of Marvel's so far.

And honestly, I've never liked Jake Gyllenhaal. I honestly can't see him as Batman and maybe that's because what I've seen him in or just my view, but I just can't get behind it. However, I do want to see this Batman earlier in his career, and maybe see where he took this darker turn to be like Keaton's.. and Kilmer's... and Bale's...and technically West's though his didn't really intend it. Know what, just generally why this Batman isn't against killing so maybe the people that cried about that can be quiet since they grew up with Bale's Batman that only had ""one rule"" that, assuming it was killing, he broke in all 3 movies.",0.9637,659
