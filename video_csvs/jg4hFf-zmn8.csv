"""The love's gotta go somewhere."" Some of the most uplifting words regarding loss I've ever heard. I dream of one day owning a farm where I care for abused and neglected animals---seeing it actually existing gives me hope for the future and if I could find a way to thank Robin in person for what she has given back to our world I would. Thank you for everything you do Robin and thank you for inspiring me to let the love go where it must! ❤️",0.9168,93

Ronnie, I am in love with.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  Last year, my husband decided to put in a blueberry farm, in hopes that when he retires, our son would have taken over, not only his business but the farm as well.  I told my husband last year, that I wanted some sort of live stock and I wanted a donkey.  We have 20 some odd acres of land.  We already have an existing barn.  Now, for obvious reasons out plans are on old.  I so love this video though.",0.7252,153
