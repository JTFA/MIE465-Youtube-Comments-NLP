"A little too harsh on Miley in my opinion. Miley new Chloe was special, but chose Ashland because she thought Ashland would have a better chance at winning the show - country artists win whereas rock artists don't. Chloe stated that after Miley chose Ashland she went up on the stage, hugged Ashland, then hugged Chloe and whispered to her not to worry - ""you're not going anywhere"". Miley new Chloe would be stolen.",0.9723,83
