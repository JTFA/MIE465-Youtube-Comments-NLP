"Dear brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ loves you so much. He desires to have a close and personal relationship with you. Will you accept Him and give your life to Him this very moment? In closeness with Jesus you are safe. In the intimacy of His presence you are energized. No matter where you are in the world, you know you belong when you sense Jesus Christ is near. Ever since the Fall, man has experienced a gaping emptiness that only Jesus presence can fill. You were designed for close communication with our Creator Father God. Father God enjoyed walking in the garden with Adam and Eve, before the evil 
one deceived them!                                                                                                                        

When you commute with Jesus in the garden of your heart, both you and Jesus are blessed. This is His way of living in the world---through you! Together we all can push back the darkness, with Jesus Christ whom dwells with us for He is the light of the world. Believe in Jesus Christ, accept what He did on the cross for the sins of mankind. Ask our Lord and Savior to forgive you of your sins, study The Living Word in the Holy Bible. Allow yourself to be washed clean and made anew by His precious blood. Welcome the Holy Spirit into your whole being. It will be the greatest decision you will ever make.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Psalm 32:7;  Genesis 3:8-9; John 3:16; John 8:12)",0.979,275

I am thinking of Keith Urban who does much more thoughtful and innovative music -- especially in this time of the ""MeToo"" movement.
