"+Grayson Mendenhall - Obama's ""legacy"" is the TEN TRILLION he gave to his Bankster buddies. The other TRILLIONS in unfunded liabilities like his Obamacare fascism. All charged to the little guy by printing money that devalues our dollar and wages. We might not make it another decade due to that fatal mistake. Obama also bundled up thousands of Fannie Mae foreclosures and sold them to his hedgefund pals for pennies on the dollar. The only condition is they can't tell anybody how cheap they bought them for. Too bad for the young people in our Country who can't afford a home now. How about Obama's NSA that spied on EVERY American, including political opponents, then he had Clapper lie to Congress about it even existing? Or, Obama's INVASION of Libya without Congressional consent? He and Hillary trying to do the same in Syria (luckily Congress did stop that aggression). Abusing the IRS to disenfranchise voters, then destroying multiple hard drives? Blaming Benghazi on a Youtube video and having the author arrested for his free speech? Lying to the military families about what happened. Giving Iran half a billion in cash....etc...etc...etc...  And yes, Trump's Presidency will end up looking like a stain because Obama's bubble is about to burst. The media will blame Trump.... And Obama needs to get some better taste in music.

"A top-secret memo that has been released to members of Congress, but still is being withheld from the American public, characterizes Barack Obama as ‚Äúthe vengeful narcissist‚Äù and alleges surveillance abuses by his administration that one representative likened to the work of Russia‚Äôs KGB.

The document, released to members by the House Intelligence Committee, centers on the the controversy over unmasking and FISA surveillance, reported FoxNews.com.

The House Intelligence Committee Thursday approved a motion by Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., to release it to all House members, with Democrats opposing the move.

Lawmakers said they could not yet discuss the contents, but now there‚Äôs an effort to make the memo available to the public.

The fight encompasses the Democrats‚Äô claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, the subject of special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs multi-million dollar investigation, and the so-called anti-Trump ‚Äúdossier.‚Äù

While Democrats continue to maintain that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016, there‚Äôs evidence the Democrats paid for the largely discredited dossier, which may have then been used by the Obama administration as the basis for surveillance of Trump campaign officials.

Author, former Secret Service agent and former congressional candidate Dan Bongino tweeted: ‚ÄúTake it to the bank, the FBI/FISA docs are devastating for the Dems. The whole image of a benevolent Barack Obama they‚Äôve disingenuously tried to portray is about to be destroyed. The real Obama, the vengeful narcissist, is going to be exposed.‚Äù

"Letterman-Obama Netflix Interview Gets Negative Reviews: ‚ÄòFawning,‚Äô ‚ÄòLackluster,‚Äô ‚ÄòBland‚Äô
http://freebeacon.com/politics/letterman-obama-netflix-interview-gets-negative-reviews/
BY: David Rutz 
January 12, 2018 4:53 pm

Friday's 12 January 2018 Netflix premiere of David Letterman's interview with former President Barack Obama received negative reviews from the press, with critics calling the host too ""fawning"" and the overall show ""bland"" and ""lackluster.""

Letterman, who was a staple of late-night television for 33 years with ""Late Night"" and then ""The Late Show,"" spoke to Obama for the first episode of a six-part series in which he speaks for an hour with people who he admires.

The Obama interview, conducted at City College in New York City, touched on his post-presidency, Russian election interference, voting rights, race, family, and more.

However, Letterman's obsequiousness, Obama's cautious answers‚Äîhe never directly mentioned Donald Trump‚Äîand the fact that the interview was taped last fall made for a tepid viewing experience.

""In basically ignoring the ever looming current President of the United States on another s**tstorm of a day, the pre-taped result from last fall was primarily a warm, fuzzy, and sauntering up on dull chat between two well-spoken men who obviously like and respect each other and didn't want to cause each other any possible grief,"" Deadline‚Äòs Dominic Patten wrote. ""This debut episode of ‚ÄòMy Next Guest' was not scintillating television by any stretch.""

The Washington Post‚Äòs Hank Stuever panned the interview as ""flat,"" criticizing Letterman as too much ""in thrall"" of his guest. Letterman told Obama at one point that he is the only president who he has ever truly respected.

""Both men seem rusty at the art of banter,"" Stuever wrote. ""They're off their game. The interview doesn't produce any surprising or newsworthy statements from Obama.""

The Boston Globe expressed annoyance with the format and said it did ""nothing interesting at all.""

""It's all pretty rote and familiar, and what's worse is Letterman's stage and interviewing manner, which is clearly rusty,"" Matthew Gilbert wrote. ""He fawns over his guest more than he should, he makes awkward jokes about this new-fangled thing called Netflix, and he drives the conversation into a mutual children-appreciation session so that he can enthuse about his son and Obama can enthuse about his daughters.""

Spin‚Äòs Drew Salisbury hit Letterman's interview style for failing to probe Obama deeper, saying, ""Aside from a few moments, the interview is unfortunately neither revelatory or particularly engaging.""

USA Today‚Äòs Kelly Lawler called the interview ""a bit lackluster,"" saying it livened up more when the two men discussed their children.

Vanity Fair writer Laura Bradley expressed disappointment with the ""bland"" show failing to go deeper with Obama, as well as dodging Trump discussion.

""Although Letterman is too experienced and too wry by nature to engage in outright platitudes, his series' premiere feels like a lot of generalities and old news masquerading as something more profound,"" she wrote.

Variety praised Letterman's wryly activist approach and said it ""isn't bad"", but Sonia Saraiya also wrote that the pre-taped format was ""stale.""

""Letterman was never known for his interrogatory skills anyway‚Äîthe occasional delightful curveball notwithstanding‚Äîand nothing he does here is going to reverse that impression,"" Vulture‚Äòs Matt Zoller Seitz wrote.

The Hollywood Reporter‚Äòs Tim Goodman said the interview was ""not groundbreaking"" and added that it was a ""big disappointment"" not to get juicy Obama remarks about Trump. But he added that the point of the show was a welcome one: to allow a more serious Letterman to come through.

The reviews were not all bad. The New Yorker‚Äòs Ian Crouch lavished praise on Obama for his looseness and humor, saying he would make a good television host himself, although adding‚Äîless critically‚Äîthat the ex-president's remarks during the hour-long show have mostly been said before.

""The effect is familiar, and is enough to make a sympathetic viewer feel wistful for saner times, but perhaps little else,"" he wrote.",0.9732,792
