"All of the songs you named were also not my favourite cuts on this record. But literally all of the good tracks I did not hear you mention at all. ""Nothing Left For You"" has beautiful melodies & simple but very relatable lyrics. ""Pray"" is a huge departure for Sam production wise working with the likes of Timbaland & Poo Bear to create something that is still within his wheelhouse but also consumable for mainstream charts & ""HIM"" is an incredibly personal track where for the first time ever Sam uses pronouns in a song & really owns his sexuality plus the choirs and their harmonies ARE EVERYTHING!

You ever think about acknowledging your own subjectivity rather than trying to form an objective opinion based on the technicality and musicianship of each piece? Like we trust you now, so maybe let lose and tell us more about your decisions than the technical side. I dunno, not attacking you, I love your reviews, but would like to hear more of your ‚Äúopinions‚Äù as well as the analytics. Btw, hate this album.",0.9597,148
"I prefer his first album for sure and I only even listen to the sad songs because those were the ones that really pulled me in and made me feel~ I feel like he was trying to stray from that image of being the sad boy so he went for a more pop and upbeat album which isnt the reason people loved him so much. Disappointed he didn‚Äôt have as many slower and more intense songs but as a surface level pop head, I think this album was pretty good. Way better upbeat tracks than his first album.

"Thoughtful comment:

Banal lyrics?
""Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end""
Or
""I feel you staring when he is with me
How can I make you understand?""
Or the refrain of ""No Peace""

I feel like this matches his character (and voice) perfectly. Besides - this is pop music. Sure it won't be the most poetic thing ever made. Sure it's gonna be filled with a bit cheezy and corny verses. But it is what popular music is about.

Also, I don't think you gave enough credit for production on this thing. It's really clean and fits in his style perfectly.

You criticized mainly the first half of the album (which I also feel is more by the numbers and not that exciting), but what about second half? The song HIM for me is beautiful, tells about what could be the main problem of LGBT community and does it in spectacular way, especially with the choir in the background. And while ""Baby, You Make Me Crazy"" is kinda silly, the context of the song is actually pretty aimfull. I personally can't stop smiling whenever it hear this cut.

I don't get also why you were talking 'bout Sam riping off other artist. It's popular music - same chord progression almost all the time, but with different arrangement, delivery etc. And while all of those songs sound like they were made by someone else before, they were never performed by Sam Smith. His voice - quivering so much - is still his main strengh and that is the thing he could be (and pretty much is) apppreciated for in general.

Pretty much my review of the album. Stay tuned and pay attention for the next comment section of the next video. I'm gonna steal his spotlight.
