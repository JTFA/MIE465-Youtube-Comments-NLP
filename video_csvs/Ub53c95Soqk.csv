"Lilac, in my case we had no association with Britain when it came to that particular christmas habit. My nanna was born in Australia. My dad was born in Wales  and came out with his family at the age of 6 months but that tradition was something that mum provided for us, not dad. I always just thought it was an Aussie tradition. Surprised your family started using the later 5c pieces. We stopped the tradition at some point when we ran out of sixpences. I think they were cooked in the cake. Maybe that his why your family put the 5c pieces in after the cooking process. 

Actually just did a Google search and found all the answers about that in the 1st paragraph of this link:  https://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/is-it-ok-to-put-coins-in-the-christmas-pudding-20131115-2xn0i",-0.1531,140
"Lilac:  Did you read the 1st paragraph of that link? It explains the 1966 move to decimal currency meant that the later currency was unhealthy to cook. I can't recall mum ever replacing the sixpence for decimal currency but as we got older, I think she just stopped worrying about using the tradition. Maybe she lost the last of the sixpences, I don't know. It's sad how all these little traditions have gone by the wayside. That's life. Have a nice new year.",-0.3755,93

Sandra Jones Haha me too on the sixpences lol. Grew up in the 70s but Mum still kept the 6p pieces so we could do this :),0.8248,28
"Sandra, ah the memories :) My Grandma used to do that when I was a child. A little later than the 60's, so she used normal coins & somehow every person always got a coin in their piece! With the kids, sometimes it was even 2 low value coins, somehow always the same value as their siblings. It was only as an adult I learnt the secret - that the coins were added to each piece after it was cut lol! Magic as a child though :)

In saying that, that is NOT an Australian tradition, that's a remnant of a time when anyone born in Australia was automatically a ""subject of Her Majesty"" & pressured to show their devotion to their leader the Queen, by persevering with the heat & eating a traditional English Christmas dinner, despite being so far from ""home"" Hard to believe it was only as recently as 1949 that we even got to be citizens of the country in which we were born!

I'm actually glad to see us now breaking away from that suppression & developing our own culture. We can't really call ourselves ""Australian"" if our heart belongs to England can we (& tbh, I only ever ate the pudding for the money, I always liked the nice cool cherries & apricots MUCH more :))",0.9677,248
"Sandra, anything hot is usually an imported tradition :)
My Grandma was the only one who was keen on it, she was born here, but her Grandma was English & moved here just before her daughter (my grandma's mother) was born, but passed down the love of the Queen/royal family to her. I saw the movie ""Bran Nue Dai"" with her & she LOVED it, especially the memory of the standing to sing God Save the Queen when the characters in the movie go to the cinema, all those English connections to her were special & important :) 

Rest of my family have been here much longer & thought she was a bit nuts lol - oh that's another Christmas tradition, buying bags of nuts & cracking them :) I don't know, but guessing from the carols that that's an English not Australian tradition too

Anyway, our family's pudding tradition was apparently sixpence (collected after each dinner & saved again to reuse the next year), but they did get low, I think some of the older relatives accidentally ate some of them each year (but could be just good stories) but from as young as I remember properly, it was 5 & 10c pieces. I think my family changed it when us kids were at a toothfairy age, with the intention of sort of replicating that. Mostly it was 5c pieces, but the kids mostly got a 10c, or 2x5c & then later occasional years it would be 15c total. Stayed that way until my Grandma died & then stopped",0.9849,289

He truly knows how to sell; I am so envious of the Australian now and of the manner wherein they pass Christmas ! I am now most anxious to discover that country as well as that new show on that cruise ! Wolverine will be assuredly missed, but no regret is to be conceived of this, Hugh !

"Yes Sandra, but it doesn't change my family's traditions. Presumably pre 1966 they used standard sixpence & people who got them kept them. Post 1966, my Grandma collected sixpence to keep using in the puddings & each year, she'd collect them back up for the next year's pudding. When us kids were old enough to be getting money in a magical way (toothfairy), the sixpence collection & trading for modern coins was replaced with modern coins being inserted directly into the pudding straight before serving. When my Grandma died, the last of the English Christmas traditions died with her, so no more Christmas pudding for my family
