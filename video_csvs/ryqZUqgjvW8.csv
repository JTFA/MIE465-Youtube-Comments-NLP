"#JusticeLeague is eveything I wanted it to be. It's fun while also still having a bit of the darker tone from the other DC Films like Man of Steel and BvS, while also capturing the hope of Wonder Woman. It didn't feel like a film from two directors. Sure there were some scenes that felt like Whedon wrote it. The Villain is seriously lacking but that's a problem for most superhero movies, Marvel and DC both. They were some scenes where the Visual Effects were a little noticeable, especially scenes were they reshot with a mustached Henry Cavill. But overall any fan of DC or Marvel and Superheroes in general will have a wonderful time seeing this movie. It leaved me wanting more from each and everyone of the heroes, which is the best part of the film, the Justice League themselves. There were a few scenes that felt they were cut a little short, but overall this is a worthy superhero film for all fans of every age. Also Danny Elfman's score is really great, was worrying since it wasn't Hans Zimmer, but it works so well in the film. Highly, highly recommend everyone to see this. Also the two post credit scenes are the best ever. 

#JusticeLeague is a 8.5/10",0.9957,235

I watched it with a massive sense of excitement last night here in Australia going in. Coming out it was like someone took a shit in my mouth. Seeing Batman on his back, like a turtle too tired to get up, was horrible, along with his stupid big open mouth grin in one scene. This should NEVER be written let alone filmed. Danny Elfman's score was ugly with its jingle jangle cadence of noises associated with his previous Tim Burton scores. For a composer you'd think he would allow the music to breath? No ! Its full of so much noise that no instrument can shine. His re-writing and interpreting Wonder Woman's theme was hideous. Nothing uplifting !  A lot of silly dialogue between Lois and Clark in the Kent corn field that could only be written for people who didn't know Lois was an ace reporter for the Daily Planet ... so we will make her say it in an unnatural way. Worst of all ""The Ring"" conversation in the corn field, found in the trailers, isn't even in the film I saw last night. Nor was the Alfred speech of, ""Let's HOPE you're not too late?"" GONE from the film as well. Batman came off as a complete whimp in this film. His opening scene was amazing. After that all he did was toughen up like a wet noodle. Flash was great as was Aquaman. (just look away at his silly ocean entry style when he departs Bruce Wayne. Fuck me why ooh why??? ) I waited 40 years to see this film and I was massively dissapointed. Poor Ben Affleck !

I really liked it but there was a lot of stuff missing, some scenes that connected certain storylines.
The CG was mostly good but some very obvious Greenscreen-shots, continuity-problems  and that horrible CG of the Mustache removal. 
Especially in one scene it is so obvious, his mouth just looks wrong and strange.
Besides that, there was a lot of really great stuff, the beginning with batman for example. the chemistry between the characters, some of the dialogue and some one liners.

"I don't see the point of Justice League, after Batman Forever and Batman & Robin; Batman Forever was about sanity having a duty to let craziness not be self-destructive, and Batman & Robin was about unification needing the support of alienation.

Even if Justice League is fun, the intellect of Forever and Batman & Robin just makes Justice League feel defunct and pointless",0.9382,68
"I don't think it's true DC is course correcting. They've always had the plan to go lighter after BvS and Snyder has been telling that for years now. I mean the end of BvS was actually turning the tone and the character a bit lighter.
Still, there is drama, character moments and when you consider the post credit scene... I would say DC is sticking with their vision and just moving on.
The people who loved BvS will love this one as well and the people who wanted Avengers in DC skin... well they might find something to enjoy as well.",0.9576,110
"I don‚Äôt think Rocha knows how filmmaking works. You do realize these films aren‚Äôt shot from beginning to end, right? You know they‚Äôre not shot in chronological order, right? Zack completely principle photography, everything of Whedon is a reshoot. 
Whedon doesn‚Äôt just show up mid way through principle photography and then shoot the last half of the film. Some of the beginning scenes are his not Snyder‚Äôs....and some of the end scenes are Snyder‚Äôs and not Whedon‚Äôs.... There is no ‚ÄúYeah halfway through it got bright all of a sudden and there were jokes, that‚Äôs where Whedon walked in and filmed‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt work like that lol",0.7149,139
"I enjoyed the movie.. It has its flaws but they're all consequences of chopping a movie from 2 hours and 40 minutes into 2 hours. So who we have to blame is the head of WB. Stop chopping it to make more money. Another flaw is a weak  villain and really poor CGI on the villain. We can't fall in love for a film hoping that there is going to be and extended cut later. I'm a huge DC Fan but in the movie business, Marvel keeps taking them to school.",-0.9577,99

"I got to go to a press screening last night. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the ticket. I give it a 5 out of 10. It's not nearly the train wreck that BvS was, but it's just not very good. Completely formulaic. And the CGI is terrible. It almost seemed like some scenes weren't finished. There were some nice moments. Some decent interaction among the League. But I can't help but think of this as another disappointment from DC.",-0.8478,93
"I have no idea why WB would force this movie to be under 2 hours long. I could be wrong, but I think EVERY Marvel movie is over 2 hours long. Its nonsense. However, many of the complaints I'm hearing about this movie I can easily level at many Marvel movies, throw away villains and unfinished CGI - true enough the CGI may look very unfinished in Justice League, but I have been very unimpressed with AoU, Civil War (specifically Spiderman and Black Panther, Spiderman Homecoming and just about any time Hulk has been on screen. I cannot help but think that because Marvel has been doing 8/10 CGI and throw away villains for so long, people no longer criticise it. THey get a by. I'm saying all this, but actually, I want DC to have strong villains. It was the most disappointing thing about WW and the best thing about BvS and MoS. So I'll wait til friday to see for myself, but it sounds like I'm gonna go watch a Marvel movie made with DC characters.",-0.913,199

I love seeing DC fail,0.1779,5
"I never read comics so idc about Marvel vs. DC, but I love this genre and just want to see good content. DC is trying to play catch up to Marvel, from an outside perspective, and it has led to them rushing things. They haven‚Äôt established a solid foundation, and yet they continue to build on it. It‚Äôs like building on quick sand or something. Idk if it‚Äôs the writers being terrible or the execs just trying to cash out, it‚Äôs probably both, but it clearly shows. There‚Äôs no meaning here. 

And to people that continue to defend this no matter what, they‚Äôre HURTING DC in the long run. They‚Äôre showing that they don‚Äôt care, they just want to be loyal and praise it, rather than trying to see a quality movie. WB won‚Äôt change anything if people remain so stubborn.",0.9727,178
"I really don't understand the need for critics at all. Can someone explain the usage to me? I tried using food critics for picking a restaurant for a date and it was five stars on all sites with a ""world renown"" chef. I was like great, let's see what the buzz is. It was, and I do not exaggerate here, the worse meal I have ever eaten and cost me over $100. Many movie critics have absolutely hated some of my favorite movies. I have watched, I would venture to say over hundreds of movies and if I still can't make a decision on what might appeal to me that is kind of sad.",-0.7609,128

I think it is a good idea to leave you wanting more for different characters.... You are invested now and you will research the others and go see the movies when they come out...,0.4019,36
"I want to see Zack Snyder's FULL cut. The studio needs to back off, they forced the film to fit into a 2hr runtime and it hurt it overall. You think WB would have the common sense to let the film tell it's whole story, considering that there were no solo films for these characters beforehand, I felt like there was more that we didn't get to see. Also joss whedon is okay when it comes to character interaction but he's corny as hell with all the quips. I'd rather have a darker DCEU personally (I thought man of steel was amazing minus the tiring action scenes at the end).",-0.5346,120
"I will say it to my grave that MoS and BvS UE are the only good movies so far in the DCEU. WW was extremely disappointing for many reasons. Jokes, one-liners, and smiling don't equate a good movie. Ask yourself this: If Superman was real, do you want him joking and smiling when the world is in great danger? There is always room for hope and optimism, but why would heroes try if there wasn't?",0.9233,85
"I will watch it, but with expectations still low.  As I recall some of you guys, most notably Schnepp and Dennis, went gaga over ""Suicide Squad"".",-0.872,33

"I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie, but I have to say it's not encouraging to hear that they cut alot of stuff out. That to me is a bad sign, especially when I think of the travesty that was the new fantastic 4. I understand they wanna keep the run time in check but honestly 2.5 hrs for a major blockbuster like this would not have been unreasonable. And they would've been able to better flesh out the characters. I don't like watching a choppy movie, it completely takes me out. And I think it unfair that the fans would now have to wait for a directors cut or bluray to see what the full vision was for the film. Y couldn't u have shown us that in theatres when we paid for it?",0.6353,146

If there are scenes that felt like they should go on longer or end abruptly is exactly what happened in BvS theatrical cut.

Some comments say: ""Your just a hater"", others say, ""I like so and so's review because they said it was good and they are being honest"". Two people can give honest opinions but they don't have to be the same.

It has no strong lesson, or impact, ww at least had strong message that stick to you after the movie ended, but this one is a disposable popcorn movie, one more akin to transformers, although with cooler moments.

Cyborg was nowhere as good as the flash but still an amazing character and one to remember. Batman and Superman were so much better than they were in BvS. Wonder Woman really stood out and I liked how there was some character development for her and Batman. Steppenwolf was pretty good, all they needed to to was to get into his personality and it would‚Äôve been fine.Honestly it is my favourite superhero movie(because I‚Äôm a flash fan)and it is worth the time to go out to the theatres",0.9782,144

"Remember, Collider also put Man of Steel in their top 40's lmao. They probally have GOTG Vol 2 as on their top 5 list of best super hero movies. I just got back from watching JL and it was falwed, yes. But Awesome! If GOTG: Vol 2 got an 82% on RT, then JL deserves the same rating! GOTG Vol 2 is easily the worst super hero movie of the year. I saw JL last night and I loved it! Has it's flaws, the villan was meh (but was voiced so awesomely) and there is some editing issues (Not half as bad as SS or BVS), but overall I enjoyed this movie more than all of the DCEU movies thus far. It was a ton of fun. I took a mate of mine who didn't like BVS and SS, and said this was her best DC movie since the Dark Knight Rises. A few people i know who saw it before me are saying the same thing too. They all loved it! All movies are subjective- I know, but I'm struggling to understand why some of these reviews are shitting on it that much. But hey, it appears to be the norm to shit on Zack Snyder and DC these days.",0.9756,242

"So many people here in the comments flipping their shit over the score Perri and John gave a movie that the VAST majority of you haven't even seen yet to even have an honest opinion on! You're all throw tantrums about ""bias"" and yet here you are ASSUMING the movie is a 8/10 or better before you've even seen the movie! That's the very definition of bias! You have a fully formed opinion on something you haven't seen! What happens if you see it and think ""oh wow it's actually a 5/10"". I mean really people. I haven't seen it yet but I personally don't have high hopes but that's because I haven't liked any of the DCEU films thus far but I'm still hopeful because I love these heroes. I feel like the majority of you guys would be better off finding a channel that's more DC centric so you don't get so upset and angry at people for not liking something as much as you do.",0.8257,181
"So she likes that Steppenwolf is simple because they could focus on the JL, but Marvel has ""weak villains"" for doing this very thing.",-0.736,28
"So they are pulling the same shit they did with BvS. Cut out the extended versions of scenes and plot development for theatrical , get burned down critically , then release the real version.

"The credits are rolling at screening of Justice League...and I'd give it maybe a 7.
Pros: Wonder Woman
The Flash (most of time)
The fight sequences
Superman
Most of the humor
End credits sequences
Cons: Steppenwolf (and his 2004-level CGI)
The plot
Some of the forced humor, particularly from Flash
Batman",0.7599,63

"There is no excuse for bad visual effects in a movie of this magnitude. They had all the resources necessary to make sure the visuals were spot on.  This was not the movie to skimp on!!

"What I hate so much about DC films now are Wahoo's within wb who simply put need to stop watching marvel films. Stop trying to be a copycat. If they haven't noticed by now that all the senseless changes and mandates that they put on their films to try and leach off some of marvel's success has all backfired. I mean look at the reviews ppl are giving them. Marvel fans are liking the comedy because it makes it owe so ""fun"" and yet give it a mixed bag review. A film can still be fun and take itself serious because the characters are great the villain is good and the film is written well. DC and Marvel are 2 different properties. DC is darker and more serious. So guess what the film adaptations should also reflect that. The Dark Knight trilogy wasn't comic book based that much at all but it nailed the DC tone and was universally loved by critics. And ppl weren't crying about them saying they aren't fun. They just enjoyed the films. Give the directors creative control especially if they know the source material and let them work. Ignore this fun crap and let the directors do a project that they can call their own. Then let the critics define a project that comes just from a director instead of being neutered by execs",0.9777,245
"What I've taken away from every JL review I've seen so far: ""this movie has a ton of problems and is a big mess, but I'm gonna ignore them all because for some reason I'm so determined to love this movie even though I could just call it what it is, mediocre, and go watch actual good films, but instead I'm probably gonna watch this 4 times because it's Justice League, yay, I love it, as long as you didn't give me 2 hours of paint drying I'll enjoy it no matter how many blatant flaws it has""",0.984,108

the motherbox and what Steppenwolf doing in the first place  
what's his purpose .. all of this is completely understanding .. his cgi is 
freaking unbeliveble awesome i give it 8.5 out of ten ...

issues just piss me off with cgi cyborg is very bad you know.must 
be better than this .if you watch batman suit in batman vs superman
it's full iron stuff gloves and the helmet so it's easy to make
cyborg suit with little cgi if you know what i mean .. it will be
more awesome instead of to be full cgi ... this is my only issues ..
the movie guys is amazing in all ways .. complete understanding
the flashback of each one of the league so epic so awesome ..
Actually the best flashback i liked it's cyborg you know .. with his 
cgi i disliked but his flashback you can say resolve his cgi 
problem ... there's some people they have you can say a small minds
and say there's alot cgi ..sooooo are you upset becouse CGI huh? 
Rrriiiiiiggghhtt, the aliens in Avengers 1 were flawless. and don't 
forget ofcourse thanos and Guardians of the Galaxy they are completly
cgi 
big issues huh? Rrrrrriiiiiggghhhtt Iron Man 3 was a 
big issues. Another forgettable villain huh?
