Actually Alfa won the two first official F1 championships in the 1950's. I'm not sure if they have been in the sport last 50 years though. Maybe someone else has better knowledge?,0.8333,37

Ahmad Juhani They'll definitely be closer since they were the only team last year using a year old power unit though. They were massively underpower,0.4019,26
Ahmad Juhani they will have current Ferrari power units which will help significantly. Their budget has also increased so theoretically they should be better,0.7717,25

Awesome!! Although don't forget to tell Ericsson and Leclerc to personally maintain and clean the Alfa when their done racing and give it a gentle stroke each time you do a lap coupled with a bunch of compliments during the race otherwise it'll just break down in the first corner.,0.928,53

"Beautiful car! I believe this year will be the year when Sauber gets everything together to be able to be competitive, finally! The difference from last year should be huge considering the updated engine. I don't think the chassis was too bad last year and by judging of the results in the 2nd half of the season the team seem to have learned how to treat the tires to extract the most out of them. Go Sauber!",0.7891,83

"Cenerentola incontra finalmente il Principe Romeo.
Questa monoposto è il risultato di idee e di progetti mai realizzati. 
Realizzata da un team che senza sponsor e con grande sacrificio e dignità ha cercato di risalire dall’ultima posizione con una monoposto datata, aggiornata negli ultimi 4 anni investendo le risorse guadagnate affittando una galleria del vento tra le più piccole ed efficienti al mondo.
In pochi mesi dall’accordo con FCA e ancor prima di costituire un ufficio di progettazione completo sono stati in grado di realizzare una monoposto nel nome di Alfa Romeo che saprà ricompensare con i risultati in pista FCA.
Immaginate poi questa Cenerentola vestita completamente nello splendido Rosso Alfa, avrebbe così suggestionato l’immaginario popolare da far sfigurare le Ferrari anche arrivandole dietro.
Ai più che giudicano questa apparizione in F1 di Cenerentola e del Principe Romeo solo un’operazione di marketing per FCA, dico checsi potranno ricredere quando Alfa Romeo verrà scorporata e quotata in borsa con proprie azioni, assicurandosi grazie alla F1 quella visibilità che garantirà la migliore quotazione d’esordio.
Sauber servirà a formare la nuova generazione di ingegneri italiani non solo per Ferrari, quanto per il futuro reparto corse Alfa Romeo, com’era un tempo Autodelta. 
Telaisti, aerodinamici, esperti in materiali compositi e leghe metalliche ultraresistenti impiegati in una squadra corse Alfa Romeo confederata.",0.34,244

"Maybe you are right, or Alfa has a thick enough wallet to cover up until they get more sponsors ;)

About Lerclerc, first he has to make sure he is not defeated by Marcus Ericsson to keep his ferrari dreams alive, so let's start with that. I'm optimistic so I think they will atleast have connection with the mid pack this year, maybe even be part of the mid pack fight. Except for the Alfa deal and the brand new Ferrari power unit (2 years newer than what they ran last year) the Sauber team have great facilities and I have high hopes that Frederic Vasseur can help get the team on the right track.",0.9619,124

"Sam Alfa are legendary in motorsport. This has nothing to do with Alfa Romeo though. They're merely sponsoring Sauber.

"Such a pitty the team kept the front of the car white on the Sauber Alfa Romeo. The car would look so much better with Alfa red on top of the nose and on the Halo (like the Sean Bull design).

Beside the fact that would look better, it will be way easier to see the difference between the Alfa and the Williams, which look basicly the same watched from the front. This will be very hard to the fans this year.

The Alfa won't ever be mistaken for a Ferrari since the Red colors are totally different. I really hope the team will see that some change to the livery is needed.

The car itself is really wonderful, great to see Sauber going experimental in the attempt to fight back to the front of the field!",0.9678,149
