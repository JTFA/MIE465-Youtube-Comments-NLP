You are a runner if you completed the pass made a football move or took at least 2 steps with possesion of the ball. Since the rule is you have to maintain control of the ball till you hit the ground when you make a diving catch it wasnt a catch therefore he wasnt a runner. simple as that,0.0772,61
You guys are all dum two things could have happened. First he had possession when his knee touched the ground and second the ball was out of his hands after the defender touched him to it was a fumble or he was down at the 2 yard line or a touchdown. Everything goes to the patriots,0.1027,58
