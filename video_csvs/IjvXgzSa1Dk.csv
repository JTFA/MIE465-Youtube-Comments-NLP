Lol you out a stick in there,0.4215,7
"Lol. Good video. Will check out the recipe. We used to call something similar to this  'Super fudge'; we made it with carob and peanut butter, dash of vanilla*. It needs to be heated up a little on the stove because the peanut butter gets thick and you want to mix the peanut butter with the carob so that it looks like fudge. Roll into coconut. (You can also add sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, raisins, almond butter instead of peanut butter maybe? Haven't tried it yet but I am thinking of doing so.) 
Rolled into coconut they look like little fudgy snowballs. Delish energy snack.",0.9093,125
