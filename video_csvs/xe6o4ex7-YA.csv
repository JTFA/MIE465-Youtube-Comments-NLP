"It's funny how many people talking negitve and using jokes on of how she did doing the song, Jimmy here says it's good to take risk when trying to sing songs different ways but not to do it with the national anthem. I'm taking that as his was of saying singing the national anthem is special and should not be experimented with. It's just sad that he says that but when people do not stand for it he supports them and doesn't bring up anything about this is a song that should not be used for anything but it's original purpose. If president Trump beat everyone to the punch and was he first person to tweet something negotiate about her performance the media would change everything and say how much of a bad person Trump is for disrespecting her for it.",0.4019,146
