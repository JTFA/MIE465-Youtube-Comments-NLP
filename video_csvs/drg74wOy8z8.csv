This is so sad! The transgender community has a 40% suicide rate and that's in areas the community accepts the life style. These people need help to understand their gender and identify with it. Something is pushing them in this direction. You can't say their no mental instabilities out their you know there is. I pray for their health and safety we can't lose anymore.,0.4672,72
