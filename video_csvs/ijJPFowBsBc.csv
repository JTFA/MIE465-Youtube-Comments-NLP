"A book I really really enjoyed recently was Isabel Alende's Paula, it not new at all so you might have read it already but if you haven't I highly highly recommend. It's just so personal and beautiful and I learnt a lot about Latin America. If you are on a bit of a book binge I'd love to see more books featured in your videos, I loved the one you did with Ariel Bissett, it actually introduced me to the whole Book Tube world so thank you! xXx",0.9741,94

"Although I've been watching your channels for many, many years I've just got into listening to ""The Heart of it"" pod casts - to me they're even more personal and so, I guess calming after a long and maybe stressful day, it's like a educational and entertaining dose of comfort :)",0.8617,56

"Amen to the lipslique and the cle de peau concealer! Totally agree there. Book recommendation: Nothing To Envy by Barbara Demick. It’s about the real lives of those in N Korea by a US journalist who was based in S Korea. The cover isn’t pretty, and it sounds heavy, but ignore that - it’s a fascinating read and you become so connected the people whose stories she recounts.",0.6415,82

"Dear Estee, if you liked Cambodia you must read Camron Wright book ""The Rent Collector"". The characters are based on real people living in the city's waste dump, but the story is fictional.

"Hi Estee!

Loved this video, you look so fresh and glowing too! 
I have been watching your videos for a really long time and I get a bit heart-broken
when you go away not posting for a while, and seeing you now asking for book recommendations, 
I thought to myself this would be a great opportunity to give you something back and
if you are into Rupi and peace of mind, beauty of silence and connecting with your inner self, or
just something different have a look at some of these ones:

- The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma
- Modern Man in Search of a Soul by Jung
- Living on Your Own Terms: What Is Real Rebellion? by Osho
- The Joy of Living Dangerously by Osho 
- Wherever You Go, There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn
- Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis (beautiful uplifting novel)
- The Unquiet Grave by Cyril Connolly (very short, surreal and interesting book on mental exploration, philosophy and psychology) 
- The Book of Mirdad by Mikha'il Na'ima (wonderful allegorical book of philosophy written by a Lebanese lady)
- Repressed spaces by Paul Carter (on a different subject, this book describes our modern world and how it affects us, humans, who are born from nature, living now in closed spaces)
- Shedding the Layers by Mark Flaherty (this is also on a different subject, a little autobiography of how one man goes into the world of Ayahuasca, I personally went there and met him in the Amazonian jungle and it's a beautiful quick read on a definitely new subject)

Two of my own personal books of poetry:
- Love Her Wild by Atticus
- Les Fleurs du mal by Charles Baudelaire

I hope you will read this message and maybe even read some of the books and enjoy them as much as I did, as I literally sprang out of my sofa and ran into my little library grabbing books which I thought you would really enjoy. If you will want any other ideas let me know, 

Much love, 

Maia

"Hi Estee, great video! Your scarf looks bright orange to me not red? I would really recommend ""Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine"" by Gail Honeyman, it's funny, sad, poignant and uplifting. One of my favourite reads this year x",0.8996,48
"Hi Estee. You can buy Milani products from Beauty Bay in the UK. I have a couple of those blushes, and they are fab :)",0.8689,28
"Hi Estée ! I am a very old viewer, in fact you were the first YouTuber I started to watch ! I always loved your videos and universe. But at the moment, I feel kind of you're bored of your YouTube work. I noticed that you are vlogging less, filming your days less (on social media). You also seem less happy to do videos (like this one, you are not in your best mood I think). And like the beginning of this video, you only talk about your actuality as an influencer and not as you. I have to say that it is slowly loosing me. I am so sorry, I don't know if you're going to read this comment, but I really don't want to hurt you by saying that. I just hope you are feeling good, and ok in your life. I also get that we can have our ups and downs at work. But I am less interesting about your content now. It is maybe also normal because we don't have the same age (I am 23) and the same life / interests. But I am sad, because I really like you as a person and I wish I could continue to watch your videos without that feeling... Anyway, just wanted to say I hope you're ok and warn you, because I am maybe not the only one with that feeling. Have a nice day anyway 🌸",0.988,270
