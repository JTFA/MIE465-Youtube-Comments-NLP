what happened here was that once the rocket was up high enough, it got out of the shadow of the earth (night) and into sunlight, which was then reflected by the gas and seen back on the ground. because it was dark back down this became very visible.

to go into orbit you have to go slightly up and then sideways very fast http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2001/08/newton_s_cannon/9208778-5-eng-GB/Newton_s_cannon_node_full_image_2.gif

"how far is it rocket from you? 300 or 400ft, people don't realize how small this rocket actually is, to put it in perspective, the rocket is no bigger than a small firecracker, thankfully it didn't collide with all those quadcopters that were flying above the rocket which are easily 50 times bigger than the rocket, they sent up a cricket for this historic launch because next to humans, dolphins, and apes, the cricket in all its various species is easily the next smartest species on the IQ ladder on this planet, and of course due to size restrictions a cricket was the obvious choice, sure cockroaches are rezilient but dumb as a post as proven in a basic Mensa IQ test, not to mention probably the size of the rocket it self so cricket was it, the cricket was placed in a small sturdy tempered glass ball glued to the tip of the rocket with enough leg room for it to sit comfortably in its seat with all the controls and keypads accessable for it to communicate to ground control and it was fitted with a very small headset, no monittor though because of it micro sized requirements it just hasn't been invented yet, so the cricket is limited to audio communication and keyboard typing, we recieved the 1st audio message which just sounded like a loud hissing noise almost like when you're frying something cold in fryer oil, first typed message was ""uhivsaaicbikais;oasonaj;'/."" trully historic, still trying to figure out what it was trying to say, haven't heard from it for over 2 hrs now, probably taking a nap",0.6201,297

"no, but we are still trying to figure out what the cricket typed in its 1st message, it was incoherent we believe due to turbulence, the 2nd Audio we got was clear, lucky cricket said ""1st you try to fry me, then you try and freeze, you sons of bitches, get me outta here, I didn't sign up for this Shit!"" as you can see lucky cricket is quite the comedian, lol",0.9239,84

is appears to slow down and even go back down because it curves around the earth and because it's moving away from us.",0.0,35

that orb ball thing was pulsating. wtf kinda satellite is that. more ways to radiate us.,-0.5859,19
"that would be impossible.

lets say the moon is right above person A (90 degreees) at a distance of 400.000 km,
Person B is exactly 1000 km west and we ignore the curvature of the earth.

the angle of the moon for person B would be  arctan(400.000/1.000) this gives us an angle of 89.86 degrees.
the difference in angle between A and B would be 0.014 degrees. try measuring that with a shaky low quality camera.
If we account for the curvature of the earth that difference would be even less.",-0.6705,105

"the thing with the waves coming off of it was the first stage, it was rotating its body around with cold gas thruster. 

it looked slow because it was very far away.

i haven't heard of the same thing happening in germany, you have a scource for that?",0.0,53
