"Clorox, I don't fully understand what your comment means, but it sounds like you're saying people are paying YouTube for their videos to be on trending. In regards to that, no, people do not and cannot pay to be on trending. YouTube sees these types of videos as what would qualify as trending, and also can choose select channels that the algorithm thinks is appropriate, and make their videos mostly trending. Yes, the algorithm needs to get fixed, but It'll take decades in order to achieve perfection.",0.8665,99

"Trending-(of a topic) be the subject of many posts on a social media website within a short period of time. Peraonally they should make it ao the person must hit a goal, 1mil views in 1 hour. They can also take into consideration how many likes and dislikes a video gets. The video gamers and comintators should get a chance to, so possibly at least 5 people have talked about it or played it total, that means others like it. They can decide to choose which gets on that the vids doesnt curse. They should also limit the news to maybe 1 or 2 vids, and put all the rest in a news category. They should do that so they trending tabs is full of trends, and of course still put music on the trending page, but put all of it, like company's other than vevo. Kid videos should get there own trending section so we wouldn't see a spam of roblox toys. Finally vlogs, they could be added, but unless it follows the rule for 1mil in 1 hour, they don't get in. Same for all of them, they must have 1mil in 1 hour.",0.8702,221

"VeroSquid YT may not explicitly have an external link that says ""Pay to make your video trend"" but they absolutely have large, overall multimillion dollar deals with major studios/networks that include clauses like ""prominent placement on featured/trending pages."" I worked in internet marketing for six years. Not all the trending stuff is paid for but it's not a meritocracy as dictated by an impartial algorithm - humans at YT exert control to satisfy paid marketing obligations.",0.8531,88
"Videos don't trend based on the amount of views they get. If that was so, you'd see a few channels constantly dominate the trending section. Rather, I suspect they're due to a couple of factors, including if a video gets a lot of views in a short amount of time, if a video is relevant to current/breaking news stories, and if a video gets really popular on other social media like reddit (a site which is often the reason behind why weird videos happen to appear on trending a lot).",0.2944,102
