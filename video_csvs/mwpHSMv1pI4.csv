"I don’t mean this to sound overly familiar or creepy, but I had a weird dream last night, and you were there. (In real life), I’ve had an abusive relationship with a parent. I’m an adult now, and have distanced myself from the relationship. I’m doing better, but anxiety is a lingering result of years of living in fear of someone whose approval I wanted so badly. In this dream I had last night, I was in my own apartment, and this parent came in the door with a giant knife, and was swinging it at me. I used my hands to protect myself, and when all the knife-swinging stopped and they disappeared, I looked down at my hands covered in gashes and blood and started panicking. I curled up on the floor, squeezed my eyes shut, and then I felt people’s arms around me. I looked up and you, as well as my best friend of ten years, were patting me on the back, bandaging up my hands, and talking me down from a panic attack. Let’s be honest, this would be a creepy dream if it weren’t so interesting mental health wise, and I’ve been thinking about those real-life implications today. Anyway, Hannah, thanks for making me laugh over the years. MDK and your other videos have given me the mood boost that is often needed to avoid spiraling into a panic attack, and I can’t understate how valuable that is. You’re great. Keep doing what you’re doing.",0.9711,308

"Make up or no make up you're still a beautiful person!  But it never hurts to pull a new look at a red carpet event, you should have the make up artist teach you how to do it yourself. Try it out at your next event and see what people think of it. You wouldn't have to wear a dress and heels, just what you would usually wear. Love your videos and Food Network Show.",0.8672,82
