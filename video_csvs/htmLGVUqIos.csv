"(Christ answers Judas. ""If you love Jesus you WILL keep his sayings/Commandments.""): 

Judas saith unto him, (not Iscariot), 

Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, 
and not unto the world? 

Jesus answered and said unto him, 

If a man (love me), he (will) (keep my words): 
and my (Father) will (love him), 

and we will (come unto him), 
and make our (abode with him). 

He that (loveth me not) 
(keepeth) (not my sayings): 

and the word which ye hear is not mine, 
but the Father's which sent me. 

(John 14:22-24). 

***(Loves me...keep my word): In response to Judas's question, Jesus explained that his manifestation to the disciples would be in response to their love and obedience. 

***(Make our home with him): If a believer loves and obeys the Lord, he or she will experience fellowship with God. 

***(Not love...not keep): If a person does not love Jesus, he or she will not obey him. Disobedience is a serious matter for Jesus words are the words of God! 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(So, if you don't keep Jesus commandments, this means you don't, ""LOVE HIM!"" You will not receive the Holy Spirit): 

(Jesus): 

These things have I spoken unto you, 

that (my joy)/(HOLY SPIRIT) (might) (remain)( in you), <------- and that (your joy) (might) be full. 

(John 15:11). 

***(Hebrews 1:9)<---Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the (oil of gladness/Holy Spirit) (above thy fellows). 

***(Galatians 5:22-23)<---But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 

***(Hebrews 3:12)<---Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Jesus will manifest himself unto you, if you LOVE HIM by KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS.): 

(Jesus):

At that day 
ye shall know that 

I am in my Father, 
and ye in me, 
and I in you. 

He that hath my commandments, 
and keepeth them, 

he it is that loveth me: 

and he that loveth me 

shall be loved of my Father, 
and I will love him, 
and will manifest myself to him. 

(John 14:20-21). 

***As the believer lovingly OBEYS Christ Commandments, he or she will experience a more intimate knowledge of Him. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(If you LOVE Jesus YOU WILL KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS): 

(Jesus): 

If ye love me, 

keep my commandments. 

And I will pray to the Father, 
and he shall give you 

another Comforter/HOLY SPIRIT, 

that he may abide 
with you 
for ever. 

(John 14:15-16). 

***(Acts 5:32)<---And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom (God) hath (given to them) that (obey him).

"Anthony Pedraza Exactly, they are bred to fight, that's my point as well, you can't trust one, also, you can't compare a cop/human to a dog. We have thought process and restraint. Most of these pits are running on their animal instinct. It's not a comparison at all. If a dog has the genetics to be a fighter/guard dog specifically, I'm not gonna trust it. Also the abnormally high statistic of attacks and deaths are something I will take in consideration. At least I can possibly talk and reason with a police officer. P.s.

"wolverine100000 I don't need or want to change your mind only you can do that. I'm just sharing my point of view

the most recent breed is a family and farm dog  
comparison was cops kill more people then the average because that is there job. They are in negative situations more often. 

Pitbulls attack people more often because that is there job I'm sure in reality German Shepard attack people most often because they are police dogs but that's not counted as a statistic is it so why should we count pitbull guarding houses ect. 

The statistic should be based on how often people get attacked by the well trained average 

Do you agree with that ?

You don't have to trust pits to want judgement to be fair.",-0.732,136
wolverine100000 actually you can't trust a a lab a retriever or a German Shepard pitbulls are one of the least Lilley to attack if trained properly but if they do attack they are strong.,-0.382,36
"wolverine100000 to be fair that's like saying cops kill more people then any other group each year

Whichif true is true only because 

there are way more cops put in negative situations more often  

Pit bulls one of the  most often used guard dogs And fighting dogs. Also note there is a subbreed in the underground fighting that is aggressive but it would likely be known as a different terrier breed if identified. 

You can't really blame them for doing their ""job"" it's the owners fault. 

You should base judgement off the average well trained average
They are literally known for being one of the best dogs with people",0.7166,115
