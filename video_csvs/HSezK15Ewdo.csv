"Some Glossier and NARS in my favourites video this year too! I left a similar content on Lily's video, but just so you're aware too - Glossier Balm Dotcom contains petrolatum (aka petroleum jelly like Vaseline) which isn't a hydrating ingredient. It's a barrier product which is good to protect from the wind, but it can contribute to lips drying out so you might feel the need to reapply it much more often. I'm a big fan of their flavours anyway (Coconut is my favourite too!) but I like it as a light balm, not a repairing one x",0.948,110
