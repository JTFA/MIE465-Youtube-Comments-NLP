They didn't understand him, it was his only choice, either to kill himself to be happy or be trapped ,lonely, in this cruel world.
So he chose to kill himself... He couldn't deal with it.
So what if he's famous, he's human just like us... he can't always be perfect. WE are all humans. We're the same, it doesn't matter if someone's famous or whatever...
Maybe he always kept that secret inside him like "" I'm human just like them. Why can't they understand that I'm hurt inside. I have a life to live for too""
I was completely devastated by the fact he committed suicide... but I understood why.
I am depressed, no one can help me with it...
He felt alone, like no one was there for him... It must've hurt.
I'm a kid, I understand! If you're depressed, you understand other people who are depressed! I'm not depressed because Jonghyun died (a little/alot) but because of the problems I have to face...
Alot of people are depressed, maybe you are too... but you should get so m e help, please contact therapists or someone you trust.
