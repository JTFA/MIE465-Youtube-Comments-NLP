2018 and we're still fat shaming people.. SMH.. Grow up folks and stop judging people.  Worry about yourself and not others.  It's her choice. You don't live her life so what difference does it make what size she is? It has no affect on you what so ever!,-0.7644,55

Evan Fernandez have you been on a diet? For some of us.. And speaking from 7 years on a diet.. It's a full time job.. Everyday.  Being thin and staying thin is hard.  After 7 years I know if I want to stay this way I have to be on a diet.. And workout and right now they are two hours long. My body aches all the time.. Injuries etc.  It's tough.  It's not as easy as people think.  There's nothing wrong with being over weight and loving yourself for it,0.3502,103

"Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine power—these are the true remedies.—The Ministry of Healing, 127 (1905). LDE 81.3
Whatever injures the health not only lessens physical vigor but tends to weaken the mental and moral powers. Indulgence in any unhealthful practice makes it more difficult for one to discriminate between right and wrong and hence more difficult to resist evil.—The Ministry of Healing, 128 (1905). LDE 81.4
Return to the Original Diet LDE 81
God is trying to lead us back, step by step, to His original design—that man should subsist upon the natural products of the earth. Among those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord meat eating will eventually be done away; flesh will cease to form a part of their diet. We should ever keep this end in view and endeavor to work steadily toward it.—Counsels on Health, 450 (1890). LDE 81.5
Greater reforms should be seen among the people who claim to be looking for the soon appearing of Christ. Health reform is to do among our people a work which it has not yet done. There are those who ought to be awake to the danger of meat eating who are still eating the flesh of animals, thus endangering the physical, mental, and spiritual health. Many who are now only half converted on the question of meat eating will go from God's people, to walk no more with them.—The Review and Herald, May 27, 1902. LDE 82.1
Time for Fasting and Prayer LDE 82
Now and onward till the close of time the people of God should be more earnest, more wide-awake, not trusting in their own wisdom, but in the wisdom of their Leader. They should set aside days for fasting and prayer. Entire abstinence from food may not be required, but they should eat sparingly of the most simple food.—Counsels on Diet and Foods, 188, 189 (1904). LDE 82.2
The true fasting which should be recommended to all is abstinence from every stimulating kind of food, and the proper use of wholesome, simple food, which God has provided in abundance. Men need to think less of what they shall eat and drink of temporal food, and much more in regard to the food from heaven, that will give tone and vitality to the whole religious experience.—Medical Ministry, 283 (1896). LDE 82.3
The leaven of godliness has not entirely lost its power. At the time when the danger and depression of the church are greatest, the little company who are standing in the light will be sighing and crying for the abominations that are done in the land. But more especially will their prayers arise in behalf of the church because its members are doing after the manner of the world.—Testimonies for the Church 5:209, 210 (1882). LDE 83.1
Entire Trust in God LDE 83
Because of unconsecrated workers, things will sometimes go wrong. You may weep over the result of the wrong course of others, but do not worry. The work is under the supervision of the blessed Master. All He asks is that the workers shall come to Him for their orders, and obey His directions. All parts of the work—our churches, missions, Sabbath schools, institutions—are carried upon His heart. Why worry? The intense longing to see the church imbued with life must be tempered with entire trust in God.... LDE 83.2
Let no one overtax his God-given powers in an effort to advance the Lord's work more rapidly. The power of man cannot hasten the work; with this must be united the power of heavenly intelligences.... Though all the workmen now bearing the heaviest burdens should be laid aside, God's work would be carried forward.—Testimonies for the Church 7:298 (1902). LDE 83.3
Family Worship LDE 83
Evening and morning join with your children in God's worship, reading His Word and singing His praise. Teach them to repeat God's law.—Evangelism, 499 (1904). LDE 83.4
Let the seasons of family worship be short and spirited. Do not let your children or any member of your family dread them because of their tediousness or lack of interest. When a long chapter is read and explained and a long prayer offered, this precious service becomes wearisome, and it is a relief when it is over.... LDE 84.1
Let the father select a portion of Scripture that is interesting and easily understood; a few verses will be sufficient to furnish a lesson which may be studied and practiced through the day. Questions may be asked, a few earnest, interesting remarks made, or [an] incident, short and to the point, may be brought in by way of illustration. At least a few verses of spirited song may be sung, and the prayer offered should be short and pointed. The one who leads in prayer should not pray about everything, but should express his needs in simple words, and praise God with thanksgiving.—Child Guidance, 521, 522 (1884",0.9981,979
