"Your lil speech about your love for Ben really resonated with me and my love for my guy. I've been in a long distance relationship for 5 months now (he's from England too!), and I won't be able to see him until right after Christmas, and your video on how you guys dealt with long distance really gave me solace when it was especially hard. Now that I've gotten pretty used to being apart it's much easier, but the fact that he is such a good person that I admire so incredibly much, makes it entirely worth it. I can't say for sure he's the one, and I think it would make me really happy if one day I could, but I can say that I feel incredibly lucky as I'm sure you do. So congrats on finding your guy and living happily together. You're a lovely person Jenn.",0.9917,164
