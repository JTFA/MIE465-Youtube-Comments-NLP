the fw is insane; I wouldn't have thought making your self backflip to the front flip rotation of the scooter would be such a crucial sync/timing deal and also where the scooter ends up as you showed too far forward or hitting you. Now I can understand that difficulty of it as very high. So after seeing this vid its my new fav you do besides what you're talking about 1800's can't wait to see that stuff too.,-0.2732,86
