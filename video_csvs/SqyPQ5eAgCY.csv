"If you end up crying like a baby because people on e bikes drop you on climbs then you need to HARDEN THE F*UCK UP yourself and stop being such a f*ucking cry baby.  Diddums want his dummy back, Awwwww!!!!",-0.8346,49
If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this bike because your just not fit enough then I have a good tip for you: HARDEN THE F*UCK UP,0.1999,30
Kudos to Pinarello on the styling.   The looks are great.   Only 252Wh and assist cutting out below 16mph isn't going to allow one to ride very far or fast.   Good luck hanging with your mate on a club ride.,0.9029,43

Rixter No not at all. The main master switch can be reached with a single shorter click of the button. It just half ejects the battery. I just took it out to also show the size of the battery pack. Also it stays awake for 10hrs and can be turned off and on via the handlebar switch.,-0.2023,62
Some funny comments on here LOL Great Vlog. I think this would make a great pacing tool. Your mates are never as fit as you so this would be good alternative to motor pacing up hills,0.947,38

"We can expect much more from a punk who looks like he's about 12 years old üòÇ... it'll be funny to see when he gets older and perhaps has some injuries or some health issues... that's when the e-bike becomes the difference between somebody cycling or possibly not cycling. I'm certainly a big fan of #htfu... but for certain riders (older, injured, rehabbing, etc)  the e-bike is going to be their savior bud. üëç",0.234,84
"We may not like it but this is the future, motor assist bikes for the casual ride that look like normal bike and sexy, at 10k AUD it is a elite top end bike so may be a slow mover at first. But we will see more of this to come from other manufacturers",0.6985,57
