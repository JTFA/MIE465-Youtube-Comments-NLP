It got swollen over night.. and red.. I didn't notice that I scratched it in my sleep but I slept that night very bad.. afterwards I stopped taking that acne cream.

Now I get acne before my menstruation and while I have my menstruation.. idk what to do..

those with similar issues can contact him on his email at: dr.musatradomedicalcentre@gmail.com to get their cure.

they also cure the following permanently: Stroke, Asthma, Epilepsy, Cancer, Blackheads, Herpes, HIV/AIDS, Heart diseases, E.T.C .

"Ok I just finished the whole video!!! Ok STAPPPPPPHHH!!! literally why my sisters face has so much TEXTURE... From all the derma. guys it's all about hormones and shii, idk. But I swear to God. The moment I drank this gluta pills it literally flushed out all the crappy stuff in my body. I used to have oily skin and bad acne. Now I put on cream from time to time because my face would get dry. Yep. My skin got flawless. I swear. I know u guys think derma is life because they're experts... But like yo, would u really wanna go through this for the rest of ur life and spend thousands. :(((  I don't know how to recommend what gluta pill to drink because I just bought it from a store, no derma recommendation. It was like magic. I swear guys, theres so much solutions out there, it's not just as famous. But there are so much better ways than having to go through this. Brings back the nightmare I had to go through sitting in class with dots on my face. I'm happy I didn't spend a lifetime before i discovered that. My cousins did the hard part till they discovered pills. Which btw is affordable...
