Do NOT use a drill press for milling. The morse taper fit on the quill and the jacobs taper on the chuck will not retain during side loading. They will eventually come out and then you have a drill chuck with a sharp tool bouncing around your shop. Hopefully you will not be in the way when it comes loose otherwise what you pay on your medical deductible could go to a real mill.,0.3612,78
"Dude. I'm sorry to be a downer but milling on a drill press is really NOT a good idea. The fact that you have been lucky so far, and maybe forever, such that that things haven't flown apart yet doesn't mean that at some point it COULD suddenly happen to you or some viewer.
Here's a video I found (though didn't completely watch) regarding a more cautious stance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-8ddRE7iWM

The tapered shank mount of the drill chuck is a tentative thing but stands up fine to axial load. Applying radial (side) load can cause the chuck to randomly and suddenly fly loose with the cutter attached. Any vibration increases the chance of this happening. This can damage things, most problematic being flesh and bone.

Believe me, I know this seems like a good idea for solving a problem on a low budget, but  there are just a couple minor differences between the design of a milling machine (or mill/drill) and a drill press that make the difference between ""dangerous"" and a ""routine method"".  They look so similar that the difference isn't apparent, and the problem doesn't show up until some goofball like me points it out - or worse, somebody gets hurt.

Sorry for the bad news. It's not my style to flag or report anybody's video and I won't do that no matter what. People have to learn from their mistakes. It would be more of a public service if you would NOT delete this video but rather maybe edit some text over it to point out the danger. After all, you were unaware of the danger until now, so it would be good if this video weren't deleted so others who are also unaware might see it with the warning thus learning about the danger.

I write this as a long-time working machinist with over 30 years in the field and still have all eight fingers ;)  (kidding)

Thank you for your time.",-0.9779,364
Eric. I am really liking your videos. Quick question: What is the make/model of chuck that you upgraded to?,0.4576,25
"Great video! I think alot of people that had some negative comments about by this video would have felt better if you had clarified that this is only really suitable for soft materials. Maybe a bit of Aluminum milling with a drill press here and there is ok, but you could have had a few extra ""safety first"" warnings.",0.6049,65
"I've noticed that, you really have to haul on the key to get the mill to stay in there sometimes. I'm not doing anything serious though. Milling little flats to make drilling shafts much easier, or slotting the occasional hole(plunging though, then side milling to clean it up). I know the limits with it, it's certainly no bridgeport, but it's definitely above the Chinese junk you buy today.",0.7587,80
"It was an option on powermatics. But the vast majority of drill presses have morse taper. Even if your press does not have a taper drill chucks were just not designed to hold end mills. Drill bits have soft shanks that the chuck can bite into, end mills are hard and need to be held in a collet or they can slip. Heck, even in some collets they will slip anyway.",-0.1027,78
"It's one of those things that can be done, but is not generally, for really good reasons.
In addition to Jerry Biehler's point, there's the non-safety issue: the spindle bearings aren't designed to handle that kind of side loading, and particularly with say, a Harbor Freight unit, you're significantly shortening the life of the pillar drill.
All of that having been said, it's great to know I'm not the only one who has abused his drill press this way.",0.7572,90
"Jerry  Biehler  Yes, I tried that and the chuck fell out while I was trying to mill. Fortunately, the drop was 3 inches down and into the vise. Definitely NOT a good idea. Very dangerous.",0.4228,41
More! Thank you!,0.5231,5
"Morse taper with a drawbar can work indefinitely, and upgrading the bearings in the quill is also recommended. After that it all depends on what tolerances you can live with. Most machining doesn't require anything close to what a Bridgeport is capable of.",0.5719,47
"Not all drill presses have a morse taper though. I'm not sure what my old Powermatic has, might be thread on, but it's certainly not taper.",0.3857,30
Some really good tips in this video.  Never thought about it but yes the three handles are annoying.  Good one there.  Thank you for sharing.  :-),0.9418,30

Thanks Eric.,0.4404,3
"Thanks for letting everyone know. I am aware that it is not the intended purpose of a drill press. For light duty and for my purposes I feel it's an acceptable option. At least for me it is. It's not for everyone. If there were only more machinist around to actually get stuff machined, then this would not be such attractive option for me. Thanks for watching and leaving a comment.",0.6902,79

"Very important knowledges about machines,thank you sir for this video.",0.2716,13
"Yea I understand about not having machinists around. It used to be there was some hobbyist machinist in every neighborhood, but I'm in the business and know very few within my large metropolitan area these days.
My concern is not only for viewers of this video but for your safety as well. Even for light duty, this isn't safe mostly because of the possibility of the chuck, which has a fair bit of mass spinning at high speed and a sharp cutter sticking out of it now, coming loose then flying out and it could randomly happen at any time. It's scary and a possible bad day, light cuts or not. You'll never be ""ready"" for it if/when it happens and it will be very startling at best. There are a couple things you could do to reduce the danger, but it's not as simple as cobbling a set screw to it. We're back to finding a machinist for that again, just for advice and help if nothing else.
But good luck and best wishes to you.",0.7791,197
"Yeah, it's definitely not what the machine was intended for, I assume everyone watching this video already knows that. But for light work I feel it's an acceptable option. At least for me it is. It's not for everyone. Thanks for watching and leaving a comment.",0.5851,53
