"All the warning systems are already  in place including the cameras in the engine dept that you mentioned, and Amtrak uses the most up to date equipment used on the rail. Before there were railroads towns formed at the rivers in order to ship and receive goods. When railroads formed in the Midwest for example towns formed at site of the railroads to move grain, and live stock. Every one of these towns you go thru  have sidings and switches that you have to pass in order to reach your destination, and its no  exaggeration. to say you pass one town you are entering another, especially in the rural areas of this country. Every farmer  weather he produces grain or livestock requires a method to ship it in a expedient manner.The mid west produces enough grain to feed three quarters of the world, that grain must be moved quickly when its ready. From KCMO to St Joe for instances roughly 90% of that 60 mile trip you are going thru some small town with grain elevators and sidings to unload farm produce, from St Joe to Des Moines Iowa its pretty much the same,  from Iowa to Chicago. Thats a distance of 510 miles and 65 to 70 percent of that distance you would have to travel at 25 mph, if i understand you about slowing down for switches and sidings, yes there are open areas as you pass fields but just not a lot of it in rural areas in this country.As far as the comment about unions i can say that has not been my experience with them. so lets just agree to disagree . I have nothing against slowing down when its justified, but i also know that passing a switch or siding is not one of those reasons.Believe me when i tell you i am more concerned about safety then the average worker, i am saddened by the fact that the general public has know idea how or what dangerous things are transported by rail. If they did know they i think would demand a full crew back on the rail. I have seen a car derail and be dragged for almost a mile with out losing its  air. and it happened because there was no caboose or crew member to inform the engineer. I have enjoyed sharing our views on this subject, but there is one thing that bothers me more then anything Why was that switch locked, you dont lock switches that you are using. And who was responsible to restore it to its proper position. if the conductor rode the movement to the rear to protect the crossings, did he instruct the engineer to throw it back, and if he did .Is it possible he locked it in the wrong position,and if that happened my next question is why. and again thanks for the exchange of views.",0.7462,519

"I in my opinion feel this accident would not have happened if there was not a reduction of crafts in the railroads ,is for this reason, if a track rider was inspecting the rail path  the Amtrak was taking over the CSX it could not have happened, if a train official had inspected the work area prior to the Amtrak's,  arrival, it would not have happened, and finally if there had been a sufficient number of crew members, that were checking on each others work for safety, this accident would not have happened. I believe since the necessary personal to perform these  practical safety steps  have been deleted that the railroads chose more profit over the safe movement of passenger trains on their railroad .Its cheaper to rid 4 crew members then to worry about the safety of a Amtrak that comes thru only three times in a week. I honestly believe that we both want a safer more accident free railroad for passenger trains to operate on, we just disagree on how that is best achieved. i would be glad to be wrong if your way was implemented and it worked, and I'm pretty sure you would feel the same way as long as the problems were eliminated, the unnecessary loss of life due to avoidable accidents my respect to you and your views on this matter .",0.9277,244

It is refreshing to have a discussion with a person as intelligent and well controlled as yourself, as i gave your point of view more thought i began to try and think of ways in which to implement a slow restriction without hurting the railroads efficiency, also it occurred to me if a slow order was in place for the area the accident happened it would have made the damage less costly and  maybe not have resulted in such a high loss of life and injuries. Knowing the trains were operating without signal protection, and no track rider, or official inspecting the area prior to Amtrak's traveling over the work area, you are in my opinion correct , a reduced speed restriction should have been in place .

"I'm sorry, I am not sure what you think the real problem is and why do you think i would want to make a excuse to hide the real problem. I am giving you the benefit of my years of experience as a conductor moving freight. I know personally what its like to work for 12hrs on 12hrs off for extended periods on the railroad, also i know as a conductor that most mistakes happen after 9 to 10 hrs of service that can be attributed to human error. this is why a crew cannot work after 12 hrs of service. It is not only physically tiring but mentally as well.If you are aware of doing your job correctly, then there is a certain amount of stress that goes with it. that is why i say they need enough of a train crew to safely compensate.  A brakemen has the responsibility to watch his side of a train in a curve looking for anything dangerous that is affecting the safety of the train and or the public.Among his other various duties his job is to throw the switches and make sure they are in the proper position when work is performed. The rear brakeman has the same duties watching his side of the train in a curve.Due to the length of trains a engineer and conductor cannot see as well as two men on the rear of the train that's watching their half of the train . You can derail a car that is 75 to 80 cars deep  and the engineer and conductor would not know it, because they cant see that far back. and if that car is hauling a dangerous substance such as liquid gas or chlorine or any other hazmat materiel's then you might agree that by removing two necessary crew members is producing a unnecessary risk. Now if you pass that absent crew members duties on to the engineer and conductor, it can become a recipe for disaster.  So please expand on you statement about me making excuses to the real problem.",-0.9237,363

"Majority of accidents are caused by human error, and just about 100% will be of a series of unfortunate events, Speed, many more times than not is the link in chain of events to be single most destuctive.  I also imagine many trains carrying hazmat materiel's will be traveling to fast for conditions in many areas, some areas of track will be of greater risk than others. whether it be human and/or technological there is always room for improment, My point having eyes/video camera and/or an actual switchman slowing down in a few areas is always, and history has always proven actually will save many ""lives,"" environmental, and property damage. select sections of track/ railway switch yards obviously some being of greater risk than others. Reation time of; realization of imminent collision, ""throttle control to air brake,"" train setting on rail siding in near proximity to switch/ main line? Surely safely, In this semi modern era, alongside entire workload, One engineer is capable of this maneuver, among with all duties, positioning throttle to idle and applying air brakes. 
　
My point having eyes/video camera(s) and slowing down in this area with this heavy Amtrak train, many ""commuters"" would have had a much better chance of surviving.

IF they still used a track rider inspecting the rail the Amtrak was traveling on, this accident in all probability would not have happened. If a railroad official had inspected the work area especially knowing the signals were out of service prior to Amtrak coming thru again this accident could have been avoided .But these personal were removed for more profit.

Your comment Before there were railroads towns formed at the rivers in order to ship and receive goods. When railroads formed in the Midwest for example towns formed at site of the railroads to move grain, and live stock. Every one of these towns you go thru have sidings and switches that you have to pass in order to reach your destination, and its no exaggeration. to say you pass one town you are entering another, especially in the rural areas of this country. Every farmer weather ""whether"" he produces grain or livestock requires a method to ship it in a expedient manner.The mid west produces enough grain to feed three quarters of the world, that grain must be moved quickly when its ready. From KCMO to St Joe for instances roughly 90% of that 60 mile trip you are going thru some small town with grain elevators and sidings to unload farm produce, from St Joe to Des Moines Iowa its pretty much the same, from Iowa to Chicago. Thats a distance of 510 miles and 65 to 70 percent of that distance you would have to travel at 25 mph, if i understand you about slowing down for switches and sidings, yes there are open areas as you pass fields but just not a lot of it in rural areas in this country. 
.
 ..:Reply: You didn't understand me correctly this is not what i'm saying. If a train freight and/or passenger was to slow down for a select number of switches, ""Due to improper existing technologies,"" and checks and balances in place,"" Train would gradually slow down as required from what ever that speed might be, we will say for debate sake 65 mph down to say around 25 mph, ""also, If a train was to ever slow down to 20 mph and only maintaining this speed for seconds would have no effect on safety of train as you stated in previous statement, trains pass through slowing/or increasing speeds many times daily, I never talked about maintaining this speed for entire train to pass through caution/ switch area only for seconds and then resuming previous speeds.

"Real Deal...Your comment: as for slowing down to 25mph because you are passing a siding or a switch or a intersection is not practical, for this reason you would be slowing down every mile or two. :Your last comment is more like the real deal, Your comment; When on the road every town you go thru there are sidings and switches off the main this is how these towns move their produce. This is more like it, There are miles or stretches of single track, no sidings/ no swithes, I knew your first comment was an exaggeration. Your comment: Speed restrictions are in place where track conditions justify them. It just a fact that trains dont stop on a dime. Yes you're comment is correct this should just be common sense, also I have been around and have operated heavy equipment for many years. Your comment: In this particular, even at 25mph temporary speed restrictions the accident would have still happened, Yes In this particular, even at 25mph temporary speed restrictions the accident would have still happened. Yes however, as I stated in my previous comment the damage and loss of life would have had a much different outcome! Your comment: Im sure you have been exposed to the overcautious driver on the highway or streets causing more of a hazard by operating a auto with complete paranoid fear. :I do understand what you are saying, very seldom, however personally have driven many accident free miles and very seldom will one encounter overcautious drivers, most are very careless and are not even close to being responsible by obeying following distance, and speed limits, most are driving like-a-bat-out-of-hell  If they would have been driving as they should, defensively and responsible then they would have been able to safely deal with this overcautious obstruction.
.
Your comment: You might think i'm wrong about under staffing the railroads causing the accident. But i know what should have taken place and did'nt. A track rider should have traveled the rail prior to the Amtrak, a railroad official should have inspected the work area prior to the Amtrak and a four man crew should have been on that freight train that left the switch in the wrong position. : If CSX crew was responsible for leaving switch in the improper position then they will be resposible for the chain of events, and there is no excuse whether it be two or four in operation of their freight train responsibilities, whether they be union/nonunion or understaffed. look how many thousands of times every year other conductor/engineers accomplish all duties safely and responsibly, :In regards to understaffing;  Your comment: You might think im wrong about under staffing the railroads causing the accident. :No not necessarily; ""There is no guarantee if all personnel was positioned on all trains and on the ground, whether adequately staffed as you say, or even overstaffed, that this particular accident would have been avoided, `Should have be avoided! ...""Unions can be, and are very well known for there waste, unproductivity and possibly have no better safety record than any others! ""That they would have executed their duties as required! Your comment: A track rider should have traveled the rail prior to the Amtrak, a railroad official should have inspected the work area prior to the Amtrak and a four man crew should have been on that freight train that left the switch in the wrong position. Again this was not about Speed it was about : And, Yes speed was just one link in the chain of events, and Yes this misaligned switch should have been detected

"Speed restrictions are in place where track conditions justify them. It just a fact that trains dont stop on a dime. In this particular, even at 25mph temporary speed restrictions the accident would have still happened, and why would you put one in place, there wasn't a problem with rail. there was a problem with how the CSX handled the Amtrak thru a area that was under repair Speed restrictions are already in place for freight depending on what the train is transporting. Im sure you have been exposed to the overcautious driver on the highway or streets causing more of a hazard by operating a auto with complete paranoid  fear. There nothing wrong with slowing down when its called for, but you should not have to slow down when on good rail and no reason to justify it. On some types of rail slowing down can actually cause the engine to derail, Its called critical rock. what happens is that the speed of the engine at 10 to 22mph will rock it self off joint rail, it has to do with the length of the engine and 39 ft joint rail and harmonics, the engine starts to rock from side to side until it derails itself. There are a lot of factors in determining what is a safe speed of a train on a given area of track, height of the rail what weight a three foot section weighs the grade of the land in a curve or on a straight track and as a rule its underrated for safety sake.Railroads do not move at breakneck speed to see how quickly they can move freight. They know how much a accident can cause them in dollars. Contrary to popular opinion railroads do not have insurance, they have to borrow money to pay for a major accident then pay it back. When on the road every town you go thru there are sidings and switches off the main this is how these towns move their produce. This is why i say its not practical to operate at or slowing down to 25 mph. you would have to stay at 25mph. You might think im wrong about under staffing the railroads causing the accident. But i know what should have taken place and didnt. A track rider should have traveled the rail prior to the Amtrak, a railroad official should have inspected the work area prior to the Amtrak and a four man crew should have been on that freight train that left the switch in the wrong position. Again this was not about Speed it was about Greed.All the jobs that i mentioned were necessary for the safe movement of trains and they were protected by their unions. Where are these missing personal? They were eliminated to increase profit for the owners and there isn't  anything the unions could do about it. Ronald Regan took all power away from the transportation unions by breaking the strike. They said more profit less safety.",0.9703,534

"The signals were shut down and not working in preparation of a new PTC system being installed, the switch in question was a manual throw, siding to the main which had been locked for from the main to the siding position. the siding is in a curve which gives a engineer who traveling at 59 mph very little time to recognize a open main and do anything about it. more then likely whoever put that train in the siding made a big mistake by not returning it to mainline.the siding switch was locked in the wrong position. that is a new hire mistake both, switch in wrong position and the fact it was locked. Thats like pulling your car out of garage to wash it but you close the garage door and lock it knowing the car has to go back in the garage when you are through washing it. A experienced conductor would not lock that switch until it was restored to the main line. that smells like inexperience to me . I am surprised a engineer would not check that switch knowing AMTRAK is coming thru. In ABS  or CTC  or DTC territory anytime you open the main line it turns the signal red in both directions for the main line. The only time it does not is when you are in dark territory or the signals were off as in this case.",0.6059,247

Positive Train Control would do NOTHING to prevent this type of accident, unless the engineer HAD been given a STOP and he ignored it?

 An Electrically Locked Switch would solve this problem, provided this is Automatic Block Signal Territory. If you don't realign Main To Main the signals governing movements in either direction will remain displaying a STOP to any possible traffic. This must be ABS territory because, Manual Block wouldn't have allowable speeds anywhere NEAR 70 MPH, which this train was reported to be traveling..",-0.9328,181

"You are speaking with inexperience in your way of understanding the real problem here, a Amtrak is not a train carrying hazmat materiel's where you should have to slow to a reduced speed to safely move past a siding or thru a town. It is a train designed to operate on the main line on good ribbon rail with no obstructions and all switches lined for their movement. They are given priority over all other traffic, all movement by other trains stop when they are coming thru. The accident here is caused by human error. as for slowing down to 25mph because you are passing  a siding  or a switch or a intersection is not practical, for this reason you would be slowing down every mile or two. A Amtrak train is designed with 2engines and less then 10 cars as a rule of thumb, that under normal circumstances has no problems staying on good track on  the mainline at normal speed . i make safety as my first priority  when working.I have seen enough death in person on the railroad, that makes it impossible for me to operate any other way. I can say this and its the truth no one not ever received a injury while working on my crew. Its because most injuries result in death, the equipment you use is that heavy and dangerous. The real problem here is the reduction of crews from four to two. the conductor and the engineer have do do two jobs the brakeman use to do. The conductor should be able to concentrate on his paperwork and the safety on the train, and the engineer should only concentrate on running the train safely. But they have been put in the position of doing the brakeman's job also. In the past the conductor would  check on the rear brakeman's  work and the engineer would see the front brakeman did their job . I operated on the the double main line at speeds of 80 mph moving freight, passed a lot of switches and sidings with no problems. As far as sharing my thoughts with the dead and injured, i would be glad to tell them they died for others greed.",-0.9704,394
