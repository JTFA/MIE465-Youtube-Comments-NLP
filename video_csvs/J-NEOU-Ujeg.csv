https://islamicexorcism.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/easy-way-of-making-recited-water-or-holy-water-using-ruqyah-mp3/

1. Drink Ruqya water, if you cant read get ""AL RUQYA AL SHARIYYAH"" CD and play it next to a bottle of water and drink it afterwards also use this water to spray your body and home e.g. the area where you are afflicted in. 2. Get cupping (hijama) done especially on the head whilist listening to ruqya at the clinic. 3. Burn black seed in a pan and let the smoke go around your home. After this apply Ruqya Organic Olive Oil on your head. 4. Its really effective to pray your Tahajudd prayers e.g. after Isha namaz and before Fajr namaz (last third of the night) after this apply ruqya olive oil mixed with black seed oil and qistul hind as nose drips in each nostril the reason for this is that jinns are asleep during this time to regain their strenght. 5. Remind shaytaan of its future listen to hellfire lecture e.g. Qayamat Ka Manzar (32min). 6. Stay in wudhu all the time. 7. Very important follow the Sunnah e.g. sit down and eat. 8. Watch ""zaidg"" on youtube and understand Waswaas e.g. satan personality is to worry you.

"Stand for what? You need to give me specific examples of this inequality and I will hapilly stand with you. But you cannot just arbitrarily say there is a ""culture"" of something and then demand arbitrary changes. For the matter, there have already been equal pay and protection laws in the US for decades. Perhaps what we need is a law demanding that everyone works equally because based on the statistics, women work less, are less willing to negotiate pay or ask for a raise, less willing to work overtime or on weekends, and less willing to do the jobs that are more physically demanding and dangerous. 
The fact is that every competent and credible economist has failed to find any validatiin for this myth of the gender pay gap. It is a load of rubbish. If it were true that you could get away with paying women less, then why wouldn't every company only hire women to save the money?

"Who died? People‚Äôs career tactics for advancement in the industry, that‚Äôs who. This was nothing more than a FUNERAL to the KNOWN garbage of the accepted sexual misconduct that‚Äôs been going on for years in Hollywood that has finally been brought to the light for all to see, not just hear about. A straight up funeral. In my opinion, if they were truly celebrating and overcoming what they hate or are most against, they should have dressed in all white, even silver or gold. Represent light, purity, innocence, triumph, victory, strength! Why black? I‚Äôll tell you why...because they are deciding as a group to ‚Äúkill‚Äù or ‚Äúdie‚Äù to the part of themselves that have in their own way subjected themselves to this stuff, only they are/were too scared to admit it. Somebody decided this was the way out, let‚Äôs dress in all black and call it ‚Äústanding up for ourselves so we can move on already and come up with a new agenda because this one isn‚Äôt going to work any more-Who‚Äôs in?!‚Äù And everybody but 3 women said YES! Let‚Äôs do it!.....this was pathetic to watch and especially to hear Oprah‚Äôs speech when she‚Äôs known about this going on for years. Miss me with the lies!",-0.5391,265

Why black? Shouldn‚Äôt it be green? Pink? Black would blend in and not stand out. Honestly I didn‚Äôt notice until this video pointed it out. Perhaps dress in derelict clothing maybe? Fashion doesn‚Äôt seem to make the impact you‚Äôre probably going for.,-0.533,57

You know what? these actrASSes are right. I want them to have equal pay. I want them to get $10 an hour just like a bagger or a cashier at a supermarket.

"they're so fake, everyone in the Hollywood industry knew about the sexual predators, yet they pretended like nothing happened, then someone made a joke about it and everyone came out and spoke up and all these people acted surprised. You Knew! And zero tolerance? there are women out there who have been abused, sexually, mentally and physically yet no one seems to speak about that, it's all just about them right now. It's funny how everyone acts like a feminist when it hits close to home, but all these years you were ""scared?"" what made you come out and speak up all of a sudden? that's a bad example to us women, it's saying that we should wait until somebody else says something first.",-0.6628,141
