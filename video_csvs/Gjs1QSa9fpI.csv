"Computer Engineering student here. The decibal scale is logarithmic, to be specific it is 20log(n), where n is the frequency in radians. It basically represents exponential increases in frequency linearly. Most likely so that you don't have to turn the knob on your reciever for 3 hours to change the volume a decent amount.

I don't know all the details about it (pitch and volume are two different things, so do they each have a value on both scales?), but that's the gist",0.2023,97

"I'm not convinced a 4 rotor drone can be classed as professional. The minimum spec in my mind is 6-rotor or maybe even 8 rotor. You'll understand why when a motor fails and the 5kg drone falls onto the head of the leading lady, bride, wildlife, ice sculpture. It really is NOT safe to use a 4 rotor drone in professional applications, unless you're prepared to explain to the client, why you won't fly anywhere anywhere near humans on set, or why your drone ended up in the sea with their footage, and you can't fix it. 
This guy gives the impression of being a professional but he doesn't even check with the local authorities in Easter Island before bringing his drones there. He's an amateur. Maybe a rich amateur but still an amateur. I cannot believe that Disney use this guy to film scenes for them. It's an OHS issue. I hope for his sake that his unnecessary risk taking doesn't result in his ending up in prison or bankrupt. 
I really hope he decided to upgrade to the safer drones if he is filming near people or for major companies. Either that, or he needs cast iron insurance and specialist lawyers on his team.",0.6959,228

"Regarding noise and size, all else equal the heavier the drone the louder it is.   HOWEVER, what also matters is prop size (which also deals with RPM) to weight ratio.   The Pro is heavier than the Spark but its props are proportionately larger compared to its body, and its more efficient because the Spark has more prop to body overlap than the Pro because its non-folding ""arms"" are too short.    You could put smaller props on the Pro and just spin them faster for the same lift, but it would be higher pitched which is louder and more annoying to our ear and would increase decibel.    If you want a really quiet drone, find one that is not only lightweight but has larger slower spinning props for its size.",0.7506,143
