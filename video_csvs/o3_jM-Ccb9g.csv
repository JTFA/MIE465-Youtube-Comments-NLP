"Cathleen Tan  personally, i...,, wouldn't switch to a water-based moisturiser, especially in winter, because it's obviously less moisturising and mmmuch less helpful with trans-epidermal water loss, which you want to avoid apropos of the uncomf stinging (damaged skin barrier). doing the 7 skin method should help a lot (but i'd advise against the klair's toner, 'cos it contains lots of fragrance and other skeevy stuff), also products with snail mucin and, the winter saviour, propolis; these keep my face in top shape, now that the weather's an asshole. i'd stay away from the cosrx cleanser as it's on the drying side (+ tea tree, which....back to stinging). also, cleansing in the morning that isn't just water / water on a cotton pad is unnecessary skin barrier damage.",-0.2247,155

"Dear Joan. Since last year i started to have this kind of acne where it just dont want to pop on its own and getting darker on its own too. It really distracts me because i'm just getting so much blemishes and hyperpigmentation. To be honest, i want the acne to heal on its own so i dont touch it and let it go through its own cicle but then even after two or three weeks the acne just dont want to pop and calmed down a bit on its own ( the whitehead that kinda appear suddenly dissapear without bursting or me popping it and then after three weeks it still get a little bumpy and that area turn dark). I am so confused why this happen amd how to handle this or even prevent this kind of acne. If you have your own experience or opinion on this  i am so thankful if you can share 😖😖",0.8903,167

I only wash my face then apply my acne cream prescription and then moisturizer and then spf. Lately I haven’t been using spf because I need a new one.

I have been using the COSRX snail essence and Innes free toner. I love love the COSRX snail essence. It has made a big difference in my skin in terms of evening out my skin, fading rosacea, and making my skin hyderated, especially during winter time. Others have noticed improvement in my skin and I have been receiving complements.   Also, I have been using Neogen gauze peeling lemon twice a week.  I have tried Peter Thomas Roth peeling gauze but my skin was in fire every time I used it. I ended up returning it. The Neogen does not give me any burning sensation and works well with my skin.  I am also intrigued to try watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer. It has perfect reviews on Sephora.  I trust your recommendations on skin care products. Thank you so much.",0.9808,190
