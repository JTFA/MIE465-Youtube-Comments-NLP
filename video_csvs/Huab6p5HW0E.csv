"*Black Solace*
1) OMG...you can project and still be a hypocrite...you are a good example. You can project your own hypocrisy. Duh. This is what happens when you learn a term for the first time on the interwebs and then have to look it up. You get an infantile understanding of the term.

2) You talked about how blacks can build paradises if left alone. I showed you pictures of some of the paradises you bring up that aren't so paradisey. Any dictator of a poor country can rob it's people blind and dump all that money into a shining city. Your pictures of shining cities don't mean a whole lot, yet you tout and glorify them as black achievement. Many cities can look good in a postcard.

Wanna see a city that you can't type in ""ghetto"" or ""slum"" and find anything? Try Irvine, CA, population 226,000. You ain't gonna find nothing. Try Mission Viejo, pop. 96,000. Both have a very, _very_ small black population. Fremont CA too, pop. 220,000. Salt Lake comes to mind. Try finding a city over 100,000 with a large black population that doesn't have a ghetto. I would be pleasantly surprised if you found one. I doubt you will.

3) Admit it, you get a tingle because the Black Panther is...well, black. And no, blacks can *NEVER* build a country 1/1000th as great as Wakanda. Newsflash, you guys can't even score high on the math SAT. You guys can take great cities like Detroit and Baltimore and run that shit into the ground. It ain't happening bruh. 

4) Yep...violence and low intelligence...that's what the country thinks of blacks and especially young black males. Young black males make up about 3% of the country yet commit *OVER HALF THE MURDERS AND ROBBERIES & ASSAULTS* in this country. Young black men commit about a *THIRD OF THE RAPES.* Thanks for making my point! Too funny. What a maroon.

5) And thanks for admitting that Haiti is a shithole. You bring up 200-150 year old history, and yet failed to mention more modern examples of Haiti's own people... Duvalier 1, Duvalier 2, Aristide....running it to the ground. When will blacks ever take responsibility for their own lousy actions and choices? Why do you *ALWAYS* have to blame the white man? Why can't you take responsibility for your own dysfunction?

6) I didn't cherry pick, I just gave a few examples instead of 100 examples, idiot. Your shithole countries are replete with slums and corruption and poverty. You know you yourself can look it up and be aghast. Denying that just makes you a joke.

Europeans probably aren't dumb enough nor weak enough to go through 500+ years of exploitation. They are dumb enough, however, to let in too many Africans an Middle Easterners to their detriment. If they are run over by said immigrants, they won't be exploited. They'll just be living in another shithole place much like the shithole places that those immigrants came from. People like you would celebrate that, because...you know...misery loves company.

There is hope for Europe, though. Poland is standing up, and maybe even Germany. Other countries are waking up too. So I'm crossing my fingers that you won't get your rundown Europe, but who knows.  I don't wish Africa's or Haiti's demise, I actually want them to thrive. Rwanda is the first poor country to provide eye care to all it's people. That's amazing, and good for them. I just point out how you're wrong in the way you glorify those areas and it's people.",0.9524,713

"@3:52: To be fair, *the French military have* since the end of the 16th century, *always had a lot on their plate, while the British military have been very lucky at times.*
When the British were going around colonising the world, they were faced with little more than helpless natives who couldn't do anything, except for India, where local princes could simply be bribed into giving up to British interests.
While when the French were conquering the world, they actually had to face ancient civilisations, who actually fought back.
*Back on the continent, the French always had the burden of being surrounded by ambitious enemies on any side, while the British had the luxury of being on an island. The French also often had to fight wars without anyone else's support, while the British could always lean back on Washington whenever they needed to, and they certainly do now!*",-0.707,175

Males from muslim countries, mixed in the so called refugee packages. Spreading STD's while married.  Many form india come and commit crimes. Ie housing, construction, education and more. Iraw and Iran. Not quite sure on this, now we are supposed ot treat peoepl as indivuidals but the state is allowing criminal actiosn ot occur of give special case permission. Ie, Amir Fayez Was ina course for botany type stuff. He smokes weed and is stoned out of his mind. Now before the course even started students ign a piece of paper in which state, you can't miss mor ethen three days and need 90% in the course to pass. This guy is some how in teh class, and is given every availabilty to pass. Breaking al lthese contracts. Then has the balls ot ask, students atending every day for their copy of notes. These little shits pander ot meotions. And hten they replace the males. 

Now lets talk Culture and Men and women.

Women in an area produce children and the nwant the best for those children and inteh best environement. So when has it become a policy ot allow children from other mothers that do not share those values. Htus conflict, and yes murder should take place when a son from another nation and completely removed for mteh reality here gets free reign, over women and to breed and hten make a drunkening alcohalic culture of then abusive scandulous money grubs, and its called Diversity. Well in reality its ruin... Destroying kind men and utlizing women to state they are oppresed and so don't even listen to males as important thing. So yes a region of men and women breed would want the best, ie culture to devleop, what I see is other males and females invading in and breeding out and destroyign the environement, its like go back ot your own lands, you never contributed and their money then builds infrastructure and udnermine the state and or take over the state, its really fukced up...

Now I am in this land, and these peopel ckeep pushing and are aggressive, adn take all means of educaiton to themselves, and the lies here are fucked up.. .So then what.
