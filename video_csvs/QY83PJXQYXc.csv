"WTH, Not to judge but critique, The Fact that he really was full of himself saying that even Jose Calderon looks like LeBron out there on the court during his tour is ridiculous. Reason being that We all know that LeBron is a once in a lifetime  All-Around player but some us are in denial or don't want to PROFESS or PROCLAIM it. 

Just because Kevin Durant beat LeBron in the NBA Finals last year doesn't mean that he is the Best Player in the world. That only means that Kevin Durant got to experience that moment of being in the spotlight and literally seeing how it feels to be a champion PERIOD!!!",0.9027,121
