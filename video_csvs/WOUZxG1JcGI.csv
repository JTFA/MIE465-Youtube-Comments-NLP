"BITCOIN IS NOT A BUBBLE.

Something is worth what someone will pay. You can't make more bitcoin. It's just a new asset class. A finite one at that. In a world of money printing presses and checking accounts impossible to bounce. Rule 1 day 1 of economics is the more money chasing the same amount of goods means the value or price of those goods will only increase. 

In addition, what you and the rest of the bubble koolaid drinkers mislabel a bubble is in actuality a new asset class or store of value that hasn't even found market equilibrium yet in a market that always and only increases it's money supply to begin with. 

Bitcoin is not a bubble. It will be stable when it finds equilibrium but look at the world money supply, which is always increasing,  I can't imagine crypto doesn't get a 3-5% market share or more on the most conservative guess. 

I think anyone who calls it tulips is the same guy who shorted Amazon in the 1990s or told you only drug dealers needed cell phones and we would never see a black president.

"I've heard people ask how they can get into bitcoin. Xcoins is simple and quick. The novice can do this easily. Wyoming has some tricky laws about buying crypto currency through an exchange. So that's when I started using Xcoins to buy and sell BTC. Ots been about 2 years and I've never had an issue.

This has been the easiest asnd most profitable way to invest in bitcoin I've sern

https://xcoins.io/affiliates?r=

The process of receiving bitcoin is exactly the same as at an exchange. First, you give money to the lender. Then, he or she gives you bitcoin. But, as an added bonus, should you decide you do not need the bitcoin any more, or you found a better exchange rate, you can return the bitcoin to the lender and get your deposited amount back! Here is how it works:

Before you even come to xCoins, some lenders already signed up and deposited bitcoin to their xCoins wallets. The bitcoin is now available to be borrowed by you.In step 2, you arrive to the site, select an amount of bitcoin you need, and make a payment directly to the lender with a credit card, debit card, or your PayPal balance.As soon as we get a notification that the payment is made, we take bitcoin from the lender’s wallet and move it to your wallet. The transfer is instant. *You can now withdraw your bitcoin and use it in any way you like.

LOW FEES
At xCoins, lenders compete with each other to offer the lowest interest rates to you. The interest fee for a loan is paid as a one-time payment together with the loan security deposit. The interest payment amount does not depend on the loan term. In addition to the interest fee, the borrower also pays the loan origination and payment processing or bank transfer fees.

There is no need to be a tech savvy investor to make a profit in bitcoin here, just keep your eye on the market and know when to sell or buy. High volatility in bitcion be careful. Do some homework.
