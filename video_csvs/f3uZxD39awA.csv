"America fought a war with us 200 years ago to get rid of the monarchy. I don't understand their obsession with the Royal Family today. lf we start letting Americans in, where will it end? Look at the damage caused by Fergie and she was  British. Maybe it is down to me. Americans are ok as individuals. Indeed there are many wonderful people among them. But as a race l don't like them.

"America was founded and enriched via the enslavement of black people. Their presence in America is a constant reminder of this, perpetually embarrasing the sensibilities and prodding the consciences of America's whites. White America must choose whether to hate themselves for this or to hate blacks for this discomfort. On the whole they choose to cultivate the latter disposition. They feel the need to encourage the world to hate blacks too otherwise the world would be more likely to hate white America for its inhumanity towards blacks. So your mistreatment is not based so much upon yourselves or your behaviour but because of their collective unendurable guilt. The better you behave, the more the world accepts you, the angrier they get! Attacking each other plays into their hands. Love each other in all your variety and differences of opinion, tastes, political persuasions, geographical locations, shapes, shades, sizes and sexual preferences.
