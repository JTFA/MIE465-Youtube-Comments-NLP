"175 years because this is nothing but a stage show to divide men and woman against each other, and to foment hatred for one another, so that those in power can better be controlled. 1+7+5 = 13. Also, the 13 children in the story about the Turpin family, and the two sisters, one having 6, and the other having 7, which again equals 13. 58 killed in Las Vegas, 5+8 = 13. And if you don't know the significance of the number 13, then look it up and study it.

Anyone who calls this law and order and reasonable justice are out of their minds, and are already slaves—beasts of burden, and steaks on the table by choice and consent. Read the comments for yourself. This world, and in particular this country we call America, has lost all moral sense of justice, and forgiveness and are hard of heart to the core. This country will not survive such hatred for one another much longer. This man appears to have been used as a scapegoat by those in power, to further take the blame off those responsible for treasonous crimes far worse than this, and introduce another story with which to sow the seeds of division and hate. And, there all the sheeple will be, ready and willing to walk right into the waiting arms of slavery, known as the New World Order.

I don't believe a single word of any of these girls. They have been whipped into an overblown emotional frenzy by their lawyers and the media. They are knowingly sending a man to jail for 175 years, and they believe they are worth so much that they have the duty to imprison someone for that long, all because he may or may not have touched them inappropriately. These girls are knowingly in return, treating him worse than he treated them. He is better than these so called victims. Why did they continue to go back to this man if he was doing this? And can you honestly sit there and say that this punishment is appropriate? Because anyone who has a mind to think, will say no. Also, the judge should be tried for treason, because of violating the Constitution, for her unwillingness to render a just verdict without her bloviating, and egotistic diatribe.

He would have been better off, (if he actually committed this crime in the way they claim), to go on a killing spree—his sentence would have been less so. Does this make sense to anyone's logical judgement? Wake up people, you are being played upon once again. This is all part of an agenda to bring about totalitarian control among the people. It has nothing to do with real justice or law and order. This is lawless behavior on the part of the court and officials therein. We cannot stand for this—this may happen to any one of you, and you will have no recourse to save yourself from this tyrannical and unjust punishment—and if you were wrongly accused, it is even worse.",-0.9968,584

I am all for equal opportunity, but feminists these days are more along the lines of superiority than equality. That last women's march they had, with celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman? They act like they're all about 'fighting sexual harassment' with their little # me too facade. But they were the ones hanging on the arms of people like Harvey Weinstein, and defending people like Roman Polanski. They lived off that garbage in Hollywood for years, even profited off from it.

"Bob Lee The man still dies. Would you rather live chest deep in your own poo from this day forward until you die? Cause that what's about to happen to him. It's almost no different from torture.

You could also say that we had individuals put to death without being prosecuted for murder",-0.9671,78
"Bob Lee Wow. I don't know what's gotten worse; your spelling or your common sense. 
I was calling you out on bigotry because I say scum in Hollywood, you translate that as everyone in Hollywood is scum. Just like I say the same to liberals who accuse me of racism when I support the destruction of terrorism. You see, I want terrorism destroyed, yet they translate terrorist as Middle Eastern or Arab. It's fun to watch how triggered these morons get. 
Why would I join a women's march? I have this thing called dignity, and this organ contained within my cranial cavity called a brain. Though it does perplex me; why do women with full rights complain about rights they already have, while doing nothing for women who are off actually fighting for full rights in countries like Iran?",-0.961,155

"January 25, 2018 Once again, I (Maureen) see a Great Flame that I have come to know as the Heart of God the Father. He says: ""I am the Father of all Ages. Today, I point out to you that unforgiveness brings with it a darkness of the spirit. When the soul decides to forgive everyone, his heart is flooded with the light of the Truth. Then there is no space between his heart and Mine. I listen to his every petition - be it spoken or unspoken. I repair relationships in his life. I change circumstances to his advantage."" 

""If the soul recalls any moment from the past that involved unforgiveness, he must forgive all over again. Holding a grudge is always from Satan and an acceptance of his darkness. There are many in Purgatory today who nurtured grudges during their lifetime. They were given the grace to forgive, but did not accept it. Imitate Divine Mercy which forgives over and over, often for the same wrongs."" 

Read 2 Timothy 2:24-26+ 

And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to every one, an apt teacher, forbearing, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the Truth, and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by Him to do His Will.

Shadowcide It's certainly possible. Judges often make sentencing errors that are corrected on appeal. I don't know anything about the legal system there. But I grew up in Oregon where the courts are required to follow a strict set of predetermined sentencing rules. Judges can only deviate from them under few specific conditions which can be challenged. It's not uncommon for sentences to get modified. I've had my own sentence (for driving with a revoked license & attempting to elude an officer) reduced after a judge decided not to follow a plea bargain he had previously agreed to.,0.2387,107

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
