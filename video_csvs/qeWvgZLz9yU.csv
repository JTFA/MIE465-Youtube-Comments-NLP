Stuff like this shows what is wrong in today's world when over complicated and resource wasteful items are made to fill a gap in the market that was never there.  I have a real thermos from the 70's that still works as good as new and keeps hot liquids hot for 24 hours with no dramas and cold liquids cold for longer.  This is a bad joke and probably costs more than a decent real thermos. A smart mug? No it's a low grade thermos that needs a heater to help it do it's job made for stupid people who think adding electronics to something makes it better.,-0.1531,115

"While the battery holds 1120mAh, it does so at a voltage of 15,2V, meaning there are 4 separate 3,8V lithium cells in the battery pack. 

So even though it's technically correct, it's also a bit misleading to say that there is a 1120mAh battery in the mug. The capacity of all the cells together equals 4480mAh at their native voltage, which is what most people are used to anyway - cellphones, tablets, powerbanks and other electronics tend to use ~3,7V batteries and therefore the capacity in mAh usually refers to the individual cell capacity rather than a pack in a different configuration like the thermos mug, which has 4 cells in series.

Watt Hours (Wh) is a much better measure of capacity, since it takes both voltage and amperage in to account. 1120mAh at 15,2V = 17Wh = 4480mAh at 3,8V.",0.4019,162
