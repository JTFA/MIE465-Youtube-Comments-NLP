"Bro my mom went into my car to put  my meds into my glove box cuz i got pulled over the night before, but noticed my cup holder had a bunch of spilled shit in it. She looked around my car for napkins and opened my console and lo and behold, my bowl, one hitter, and lighter are all just chillin there. She and my father storm into my room while i was sleeping and woke me up and asked ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS"" and i just gave up at that point. dead ass almost kicked me out on the spot tho, was shook asfffffffff.

"It’s nice to see a mom actually know what she’s doing. It can’t be easy having a white male son which I assume is straight.

These are the same moms who have cracker sons who think it’s ok to grow up to be a white cop just to shoot black people, which is why I usually despise white people, but I got to give this mom props. I smoke cigarettes myself which I know is nowhere near being healthy and I would never suggest anyone to try them but they are still 100% safer then smoking weed despite the bs you hear on the news.",0.4961,150
