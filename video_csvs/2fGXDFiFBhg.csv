"Bayahow Production iPhone is the best console, and nobody could ever fucking speak against it. When I first got an iPhone, I was so excited that I wouldn't be trashy anymore. I got so many friends with the iPhone 5C's stunning colors and sexyness, and that isn't even half of it. It has over 30 GB worth of data. I was able to store, if I recall, 10,000 photos and it would only take up 4 gigabytes. It would play games that would seem laggy to a console and turn it into a lagless portable experience. I am a true fucking gamer, I play Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flappy Bird, and Clash of Clans daily, I can message friends and stay up to date, I can talk to people with my face and always remember how my friends looked like, I can take endless photos with no worry about using data, and I could browse infinite pages of the internet, which a shitty console can't do. The PC, Wii, PS4, and Xbox 1 can't do any of this shit. Compete with that, consoletards.

Maybe when they launch the new one I‚Äôll come out with better features but this one doesn‚Äôt convince me yet and all because of the price and what if I want to use my fingerprint instead of face recognition? I don‚Äôt have that clear.

I haven‚Äôt used it yet but for what I‚Äôve seen I believe they‚Äôre right so you too.

I've used android phones for my whole lifr and what I hate about Android phones is that it starts getting fucked after half a year and after 1¬Ω to 2 years you have to buy a new phone 3 years ago I bought an IPhone 6s (waaaay more expensive) but it still works without (almost) any problems that it starts lagging and the battery is bad because my android phone (that I had) could only last for 40 minutes after 1¬Ω year when I'm just watching YouTube and if I play games my phone can't even reach 20 minutes i had that with multiple other android phones that i can only use it for 2 hours a day and when it was new i could use it for 8 hours +!

"I‚Äôve been an iPhone person for the longest time, but I‚Äôve always hated Apple products. They‚Äôre expensive, hard to replace and have so many unnecessary changes made to them whenever a new generation of their product comes out. The iPhone was always known as a user friendly phone that was simple at it‚Äôs core, but still maintained a polished and comfortable  feel for anybody who didn‚Äôt want something as advanced as Galaxy or Droid. At this point, the ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù are starting to feel like impractical changes that are convoluting the phone. Doing things like removing a home button or auxiliary port for no apparent reason are horrible for the phone and continue to alienate people that don‚Äôt want to spend upwards of a thousand dollars for something that will be obsolete in the next six months, alongside the annoyance of constantly needing to buy things like new chargers or headphones that are actually compatible with the phone. There‚Äôs also the massive deterrent of Apple having a proven history of sabotaging older phones by releasing iOS updates that start to kill the phone‚Äôs performance, or the extremely unpopular change of refusing to allow downgrades for people that are not satisfied with the state of their phone. This also crippled the ability to jail beak their phones, which was the only reason I ever liked iPhones. A jail broken iPhone doesn‚Äôt have the problems of dealing with Apples extremely strict and closed source security measures that only limit the phone and keep it on lockdown for anybody who spent money on it. Jail breaking allowed people to keep the comfortable and simple interface of an iPhone, without having to deal with Apples frustrating methods of making sure your phone won‚Äôt last by constantly making new generations and going as far as intentionally ruining the performance of their older phones.

Simply put, they‚Äôre greedy. These aren‚Äôt changes that people have been begging for, they‚Äôre excuses for people to spend more money. These changes are horrible and the popularity of their phones are suffering as a result. I would never spend a thousand dollars on a phone that‚Äôs going to drastically change it‚Äôs interface and leave me bewildered because of how much time I put into getting comfortable with the last phone. I‚Äôm never buying another Apple product until they straighten out the unnecessary changes they‚Äôre making to them.",-0.9,455

"after having severe battery problems on my iphone 6 (and a nearly not visible crack in the glas) I looked up prices for a replacement... And switched to Android. I am super disappointed by Apples phone strategy. I was prepared to pay more for an iphone in the past. But even replacing an iphone 6 with something like a 7 or 8 is ridiculous when you compare their stats with some Android phones. I ended up buying a Nokia 8 128gb for aprox. 450 USD and I am super happy with it. Stock Android Oreo does a very good job. A bit too many options and settings but after an evening watching TV and fiddling on the phone, I got to know all the settings. But whats super Apple protective is, that the very nice Apple Earbuds (not the ones you push into your ear canal - but the ones you hang into your ear) only work partially on my new phone. The center button works but you can not change volume. I found out that apple switched the configuration of the 3.5mm jack plug. Why for heavens sake?! I have not found any other earplugs yet that have the same form factor as Apple's earbuds that work perfectly with normal jacks.

"iPhone is the best console, and nobody could ever fucking speak against it. When I first got an iPhone, I was so excited that I wouldn't be trashy anymore. I got so many friends with the iPhone 5C's stunning colors and sexyness, and that isn't even half of it. It has over 30 GB worth of data. I was able to store, if I recall, 10,000 photos and it would only take up 4 gigabytes. It would play games that would seem laggy to a console and turn it into a lagless portable experience. I am a true fucking gamer, I play Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flappy Bird, and Clash of Clans daily, I can message friends and stay up to date, I can talk to people with my face and always remember how my friends looked like, I can take endless photos with no worry about using data, and I could browse infinite pages of the internet, which a shitty console can't do. The PC, Wii, PS4, and Xbox 1 can't do any of this shit. Compete with that, consoletards. Also, nice trolling fucko, with you're not including you're fucking iPhone, get your facts strate Android fuckers.",0.9088,231
