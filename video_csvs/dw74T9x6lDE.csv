I was born in KSA...and the country was amazing..loved my friends...loved everyone....now..im in Sophomore Year of Highschool . In Riyadh Saudi Arabia...and....u just figured out to myself..that i am Transgender....Male...to Female...meaning i identify as a female...but i am biologically a male...i am Muslim...and Islam...Allah..Muhammed..they all hate me...I cant disprove that....my dream is to make it to a free country....Like The US..but my grades are bad (ADHD) and my mother is struggling with money...and i have given up. I have attempted suicide 2 times....I just wanted to post this here..to show people...to show Karim..to.show everyone..that youre not the only person struggling..look at me..look at your parents...look at humans in general..life is a bitch.

All I can say it's that I am learning Finnish for my admission exams in April, I will know if I get accepted in Finland in July. I want to become a nurse to some experiences that happened since I am 5 years old.",0.9713,126

"My mum was born in Iraq 1962, she met my father during University, while my father was in University learning medicine he was arrested for opposing the Saddam regime. He was tortured then he was a medic for the army during the Iraq-Iran war. After the war he defected to the Peshmerga with my Mum to fight against Saddam. I was born in 1999 in Baghdad, Iraq. My mum had a hair removal business and had some high profile customers such as Saddams niece and Sister. When the US invaded we went to a town a few days before and came back because my Mum had to continue her business. Life was very different. Everyday I could hear a bomb or gunfire. The leaders of Iraq were evil but some of the soldiers were good, one of them saved my Uncle and cousin who were about to be executed and others were sent to kill soldiers at their homes who wouldnt fight but didnt kill them instead hid them (happened to my uncle). Unfortunately the good soldiers we knew were killed. Early 2000's my father illegaly went to London and got asylum. He stayed and got a job as a cardiologist. My family (me, Mum, brother, sister) went to London on a 6 month visa in 2006 but my Mum appealed for citizenship and was granted. Now I am studying IT in college and will be going University like my sister and brother which are studying medicine.
