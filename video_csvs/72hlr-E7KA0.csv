"Fare class Y is the base economy class -- the economy cabin is called the Y cabin (business is J, first is F), and other economy fares are like 'sub types' of Y. So, a flight with 180 seats in the Y cabin will have a maximum availability of 180 Y fares (on the native platform, via the GDS there are much smaller availabilities set for every fare class). But even on the native booking platform other fare classes may also be numerically restricted in availability, e.g. maybe only 7 class N.¬†

Also with the New York to Dublin flight, the airline will incur more fees than a intra-continental flight across the USA, so get fare will always reflect those fees too.",-0.0258,143

"Here is something I encountered that I have extensively researched yet still cannot find a reason a reason for. I wanted to travel from Pittsburgh international to Pu Dong airport in Shanghai,  the flight had a connector in Detroit as I was flying delta. Out of curiosity I decided to see how much that flight was if I were to simply drive to Detroit and fly out from there. The flight cost 600 more dollars to fly out from Detroit. So it cost 600 less dollars to fly with 2 planes than 1 (And there was not a wait time between flights) also having my wife use her Chinese account to purchase the same flight for me from China cost 300 less than purchasing from the USA even though it was the same starting and destination and the same dates and times. Also this was checked after I checked the price on my side. This never made sense to me but we always use the Chinese account through a VPN now to buy tickets when flying to China as they are always cheaper.",-0.1406,193

He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so friends, you have nothing to lose! Come as you are, and allow Jesus to save you! He will save those that call upon Him in truth. You don't need a fancy prayer, just speak from your heart to Him. He will also make a Way to escape the oncoming judgement approaching this earth.

The 777 seats nearly twice as many passengers as the 321. If an airline ran one 777 flight in place of two 321 flights, they'd save on pilot costs, landing fees, computer entry stuff, ground crew prep, gate service crew, gate space for X amount of time to turn around, and doing this more often would lead to a less congested sky.
