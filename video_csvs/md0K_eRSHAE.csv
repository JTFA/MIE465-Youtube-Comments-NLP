"Falcon Heavy had to launch SOMETHING on its test launch. That thing could have been anything above a certain minimum mass, and what is typically used on test launches like this one is a multi-tonne lump of steel. Basically ballast for the rocket to simulate what it would be like to have an actual payload on board. Since this test launch was deemed to be so risky, there would have been little point in putting an actual satellite on it. And who would volunteer to put their multi-million dollar satellite on a rocket which (according to Musk) had only 50/50 odds of making orbit?

So Falcon Heavy had to carry something in order for the test launch to be valid, and that something wasn't going to be a real satellite, so why not invest the very small amount of time and money to make it something more fun, inspiring, and interesting than a hunk of steel?

"I have been watching this fairly closely, and the orbital track (need to do more math) is far more elliptical than at first predicted. Sadly there does not seem to be any sort of RCS on the spacecraft, and the final stage engine (now a dead mass appendage to the Tesla) is without fuel.

"I'm sorry, but no, that is not correct. The Voyager probes did not have any shielding for reentry, as they were never designed to reenter the atmosphere (and they never did)*. The Voyagers DID have extensive thermal protection, but it was mostly to protect their active electrical components from large thermal swings (a problem that the Tesla doesn't have, as none of its electrical components needed to remain functional for more than a few hours after launch).

Both Voyagers and the Tesla did have shielding against the dynamic and thermal loads AT LAUNCH, in the form of a launch fairing that encapsulated the payload while it was ascending on the rocket. But in both cases, that launch fairing was discarded as soon as the rocket had carried the payload beyond the sensible atmosphere. Here is the replay of the launch, you can see the fairing that was shielding the Tesla against launch loads separating at 25:50:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c

Unfortunately, I can't point you to any images of the Tesla that are CURRENTLY live. As I explained, the live transmission stopped a few hours after the vehicle left Earth orbit when the batteries on the Falcon's second stage were drained. But I can point you to the replay that shows several hours of the Tesla's flight through space.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBr2kKAHN6M

Notice the lack of damage, which again, is what you would expect. UV photodegradation is a slow process for most materials, and even when it does occur, it is typically only noticeable when you try to place the material under an operational load (which none of the Tesla's components are).

*EDIT: Minor historical note: The voyagers did have extra structural shielding added around their RTG power supplies. In case the rocket exploded on launch, this would have kept the RTGs from breaking up and dumping radioactive material into the ocean. But that, fortunately, didn't happen. The actual Voyager spacecraft themselves however were never designed to survive reentry intact (why would they? They were interplanetary probes that were ultimately meant to leave our solar system and never come back).",-0.9501,390

Travelling clockwise around the sun requires first negating the velocity around the sun of whatever planet you are starting on, and then accelerating again in the opposite direction to an equal speed. If you are starting from the Earth, that means adding an extra ~60 km/s of propellant to your mission before you could even consider ""going"" anywhere. Given that the type of prograde transfer I showed in this video only requires a total of ~5.5 km/s, adding an extra ~60 km/s on top of that to travel in the opposite direction is both impractical and unnecessary.",0.3182,147

"Well if you don't consider the live feed of the Tesla NOT melting after several hours in space, then what would you require as proof? Since I literally design spacecraft for a living, would you take my word that the Tesla isn't going to melt?

I think you are confusing the heat of ascent/reentry with the heat of spaceflight. It's true that vehicles that return to Earth from space are exposed to heat and aerodynamic loads that conventional materials cannot withstand. If the Tesla tried to return to Earth it would absolutely burn up. But the Tesla isn't returning to Earth. It's just traversing interplanetary space, which is orders of magnitude more mild of an environment than reentry.

As I said, you're not wrong that several of the cosmetic materials on the Tesla will probably degrade after a while of being exposed to unfiltered sunlight. But the failure mode, in that case, isn't nearly as dramatic as melting. Most plastics, for example, under extended UV exposure, degrade, fray, crack, lose their strength etc. And if you try to load them, they will quickly deform. But that's not an immediate process, and it doesn't really matter since the components never need to withstand an operating load again (no one is going to try driving the vehicle). And again, since the majority of the vehicle is steel and aluminum, materials which are fully capable of surviving an extended soak in space, there is really no reason to think the car would ""melt into goo"" as you described it.",-0.347,292

Well, just saying, one of those videos will be addressing future kids about how there is a car in space flying around with a dummy in it with a sign that says ""Don't Panic!"". Then one day it will be all over the news and they will say ""If you look up in the sky at this time with your telescopes you will see STARMAN flying by on his Roadster if skies are clear in your area"". What a day that will be. Then I get to say ""Yup, I remember watching STARMAN going into space! I was just one big silly joke. And no we didn't actually think the car could drive p there!""",-0.5547,145

"launches are easy!?!?!  You TRULY are  a complete arrogant pretentious idiot. Do you have ANY idea how many people had to put blood, sweat, love, and care into launching falcon heavy and having the two boosters renter!? You have NO idea... go watch a YouTube video on how falcon heavy and booster reentry works. Then come back and tell me it’s a fake and that it’s easy. To all the hundreds of people that worked their ass off to make this happen, opinions and conspiracy theories like yours are just plain offensive. And then you say you made your shitty video in 15 minutes that disproves all. I looked at your video. I feel sorry for you that you entertain your delusional and fantastical thoughts to where they become part of your beliefs. I also can’t believe you for once second you created all those 3D models in your video. I work in graphic design and motion graphics FOR A LIVING and not just on some crappy YouTube channel. Someone with your delusional theories in most cases wouldn’t be able to have that amount of refinement. Although I am guessing you just are using your 3dsmax program with stock models. And then you bring in God to your video. If you are going to make crazy theories, at least leave God out of it. God created the heavens and the earth, the moon and the stars.
