He's way off on prices of the machines and discs. There was also prior to laserdisc ones that used a needle to play movies. Laserdisc never won any format war. It was a niche market in North America. The players and movies were extremely expensive. DVD landed in every household once the players and discs became affordable. The main benefit of Laserdisc next to a superior picture quality was all the supplementary information you could get in special editions and letterboxed aspect ratios. Later on VHS offered the proper aspect ratios. DVD offered the supplementary materials and there was no reason to hold onto Laserdisc because picture quality was slightly better and no need to flip the disc sealed It's fate. It did linger for quite some time afterward in Japan though.,0.4421,142

CAA75 was developed towards the end of LDs life squeezing up to 75 minutes per side but to my knowledge no disc actually used this format. Most used CAA55, a handful used CAA65.

There actually was porn on Betamax, not in high numbers, but it did exist, it was true that Sony refused to mass produce porn on their format, but that didn‚Äôt mean that it couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt happen third party (of which it did), any person can get multiple Betamax decks and run a mass duplication system (say get 100 Betamax decks, loop the modulators into each other daisy chained, tune them all to channel 3, cover the remote sensor on deck 1, then duplicate 99 other copies at once by pressing record on the remote)

There were two reasons why Betamax lost, and porn wasn‚Äôt one of them, it was cost and record time

VHS was MUCH cheaper than Beta (Beta was at least $500 more than VHS)

Also, VHS could record for twice as long than Betamax (I think Beta was capped at 2hrs while VHS could record for 4 to 6hrs)

Since you could record for longer and the decks and tapes were cheaper on VHS, that was the final nail in the coffin for Betamax...  Not porn",0.5927,232
