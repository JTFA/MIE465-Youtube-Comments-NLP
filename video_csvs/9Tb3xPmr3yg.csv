"Possibly its a 'brilliant strategy' to a degrade the USN ABM defence line.  Communist crewed old tugs and freighters jsut happen to run into the old cruisers and destroyers. Old Ticonderoga class class cruisers and slightly more modern Areligh Burke DDGs. These ABM conversions were the only idea past President Obama had for the USN   or  possibly only use- but it was clear that Obama knew nothing about naval strategy, risk or the fact the Russians and Chinese still have real capabilities and very fast missiles and torpeodoes. More than a hundred years ago the RN seemed to realise its rather fatal to try and put old Battlecruisers or Battleships through the Bospherous and Dardenelles as its rather to get them back through those foxholes and even an old Foxtrot or old Novorossky a (war compensation 1914/1930 rebuilt battlewagon handed over by the Italians to Stalin who rearmed it and rewired it 8 times - it blew up in 1955 either due to limpet mines or neglect- a suspected secret Nato/M16 strike in some Russians eye to finish the Russian big ship threat)  could hold the staights.

I can't change the way of thinking of all these people. I can't do everything you're asking me either, since my opinion isn't worth too much, but I can guarantee that not all Argentines are resentful, possessive and idiots.",-0.8607,87
"RORIK Bluetooth Look, I can't arrest them, because I have no power here to do it, but let me say I want them to be in prison just as you or even more. About the respect, I disagree, because I can respect and recognise that they're British without calling them Falklands. Calling them Malvinas is nothing bad, we may be wrong, but we're not doing any harm to anyone. Those who don't respect British people and the fact that the Falklands are British are idiots, because they don't show respect at all. But the other people, who respect all that aren't. And I think we deserve respect, as I said before, even though we're wrong. I personally respect every single aspect of the British culture, and not necessarily agree with it. It's my point of view. And it's okay if you disagree, it's okay if you call argies to the stupid Argentines, but not to all of us.",0.9619,181
"RORIK Bluetooth The fact that we call them or not Falklands has nothing to do with this sub. I grew up calling them Malvinas. They may not be called like that, but that's how I called them since I was little. And that doesn't mean we don't respect British people, or that we don't respect the fact that Falklands are British. It's in our culture, and I know, we should change it, we must change it. But until someone with power makes the change, nobody here will call them like that. Yes, it's in our head too, but I can't do anything to change that. We are not all alike, I think I already told you that. Maybe some people think that Falklands are property of Argentina, but some other people don't, that minority think and believe that Falklands are British, and respect that. I told you not to put that stereotype on us because we are not all alike, and that 2 million Argentines may be the majority, but they're still not all of us. There's something we both agree with: the Argentines that believe we won and we deserve the islands, or the ones that don't respect British people because they call them Falklands are idiots. But, as I said in the beginning, this has nothing to do with the submarine, and at least, you could have some respect for these people, who probably died.
