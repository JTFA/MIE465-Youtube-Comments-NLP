"Hazzardworks Hazzardworks Again, she is on a show where she has to provide comedic value. The definition of discourse in relation to this topic means ‚Äú...a historically evolved set of interlocking and mutually supporting statements, which are used to define and describe a subject matter. Crudely, it‚Äôs the language of the main intellectual disciplines...‚Äù You‚Äôre fucking stupid if you don‚Äôt understand the role history has in this subject of INEQUALITY and UNDERVALUATION of WOMEN. Read Foucault. He provides an excellent example as to how law and medicine have discourses to control the ‚Äúother.‚Äù This is equally applicable to the movie industry. Your head is so far up your ass you keep on relying on evidence of scripts, completely oblivious to the big picture. This is not just about movies-this about language and control. ‚ÄúModern‚Äù films, as in films of the 21st century, are not clean of a sexist authority in relation to its story.",0.5788,183
"Hazzardworks how would a serious issue be funny if spoken about seriously lmao?

"Hazzardworks if you don‚Äôt understand the ways of discourse, why bother arguing my comment that wasn‚Äôt even directed at you in the first place? You made no compelling argument, and while I had actual substance in mine, you denied it. If you don‚Äôt understand shit, don‚Äôt argue it :)",-0.9201,63
"Hazzardworks thanks for just admitting it, because all you have done until now is complain about her not using evidence when she wasn‚Äôt even making a formal argument, just entertaining a crowd through her own struggles (but oh that‚Äôs never been done in comedy before! Silly, women) and not understanding any philosophical background to the problem. Now you‚Äôre just changing the topic to me calling you a fuckhead because that‚Äôs really all you can expand on ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôve defined discourse in simple terms - language is controlled by those in power, therefore controlling reality and casting out what are more commonly referred to as minorities. Language is what a script uses to define and develop a story. What you don‚Äôt get about this simple concept I do not know. You keep asking for evidence, and I keep repeating direct quotations in scripts specifically casting the woman off as a lesser isn‚Äôt what matters because it‚Äôs language (discourse) as a whole that is the problem. I‚Äôve referred you to an external source who has explained my point and more. There‚Äôs no reason continuing this conversation if all you have left to talk about is justifying your arrogant choice of words to describe your self as a fact-loving person and then trying to dismiss me for insulting you, when you keep on being dense, and misunderstanding, due to a very obvious lack of knowledge on the topic, my claims. Nobody gives a shit you like facts, everyone does. You‚Äôre assuming there is no validity to her claim because oh gee Harry you like films and therefore understand the social climate of postmodern society. Fantastic! Women have rights! Sexism can‚Äôt REALLY be persisting in ‚Äúmodern‚Äù institutions! If it was, it would be so obvious I could easily label a script as misogynistic through a surface level analysis of its dialogue! 


If you think that‚Äôs when discussion starts, you trailed off before me, so fuck off.",-0.968,385
"Hazzardworks you‚Äôre extremely dense. I don‚Äôt know how many times I have to repeat a surface level analysis of the script is useless, but okay! The general trend of the abuse of language to suppress the other still prevailing in every industry doesn‚Äôt matter if the PRIMARY SOURCE doesn‚Äôt LITERALLY state women are stupid bitches ü§ô haha what is literary theory? Foucault is a Marxist, therefore irrelevant üòé",-0.9252,81
Hellooo... ur examples are a result of a progress that has just happened recently... she's pointing out what has happened since a long time ago,0.4215,27
"Her point is that women are given roles that undermine them - inferior attitudes, lack of lines, lack of leadership skills. It is through the *dialogue* of their character are they portrayed like this.

This has nothing to do with the ""evolution"" of language. I'm defending her point on the sexist attitude of the film industry and then furthering/labeling the problem she sees into the postmodernist claim because that's exactly what it is, except less developed. What she's saying is correct, either ways. 

You're claiming she is wrong because you haven't seen a script obviously radiating sexism. ""Kill the Messenger"" 2014 leaves women unnamed for the beginning of his work. One example.

This is BESIDES the point. To actually solve her problem, you can't just point out the obvious screenplays and then ""fix"" them. You have to look at discourse in movies as a WHOLE. 

Why would a script not explicitly quoting women as less be funny? She's bringing out the elements of a unequal use of language through direct means SO that her audience understands her point. You yourself don't understand me literally telling you the script will not be understood as misogynistic because this discourse is normalized because language controls reality through hidden metaphors. For a good example, look at Emily Martin on ""The Egg and the Sperm.""

Again and again, I keep having to repeat nothing is going to be seen at face value - everything is masked by metaphors, and EVERYTHING is a metaphor, because reality is held in truths (linguists will most commonly agree with this deconstructivist position).

MY arrogance? Nobody starts a conversation by claiming superiority because they are the only one with ""facts"" on their side. Everything before this one comment you've made finally addressing my claim has been whiny bs about me calling you dumb for not giving me any substance within multiple of your useless comments. I couldn't care about how this ends because I know you're going to keep on missing the point. You haven't heard of discourse until now. I don't expect you to somehow debunk its function in movies now. It took you 40 or so minutes to write an argument that uses the same points I have already addressed.

I referred you to Foucault assuming you had a general understanding of his works, because there is definitely a lot to criticize. My mistake. Shouldn't have expected anything. 

I'm not going to believe you're interested in anything I have to say if you come at me saying you only appreciate facts in a demeaning manner and them cry about me calling you stupid. Stop acting like someone who cares about manners. 
 
""Yes it is, because, unlike a lot of these jump-on-bandwagon sheep, I actually like to have evidence before supporting a movement... and if you're not going to make a compelling argument, why do this sort of political thing at all?"" Oh wow, aren't you civilized.

""If you want to change my mind, you should actually bring up some evidence... as opposed to just making stuff up that suits what you're trying to say."" Oh yes, very civilized to just label a well-backed concept as made up. Just admit you dont understand it next time :(.

"Here's the thing, they could have used segments of ACTUAL scripts, from REAL movies to make this point. There admittedly are plenty of movies, even ones considered amazing classics, that have weak and useless female characters. Then there's Twilight, which is just terrible in every way possible.

Hell, as much as I love The Princess Bride, even I can admit the movie would be better if Buttercup actually did something beyond contemplate suicide and whine. What pisses me off the most is probably Storm's portrayal in the X-Men movies, she's an amazing character and the entire time she's on the sidelines despite being insanely powerful. 

Oh, and Willie Scott, from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, useless.

Ooh, one more, Fabienne, from Pulp Fiction... she's so useless and pointless in the movie that the scenes she's in become sleep inducing.

But instead of using any real examples that prove her point, she does this ham-fisted, forced example and ends up making a joke out of an issue that she claims to care about. So for any ladies wondering why men criticize this... here's why.",-0.9445,212

"Then more women need to become writers. It's not the men's fault if writing appeals to them but not women. Women can complain all you like about there not being many female writers or directors, or they can actually become one and even the playing field.",0.427,50
"There are actually a large number of females writing scripts, but its all stages of the process. From writers, to producers and studio execs and directors etc. When men hold a majority of those positions, it is difficult for women to be heard. For some reason studios don't think female led films will be successful despite evidence proving otherwise.",0.4767,66
"There are two main reasons why there aren‚Äôt more female writers/ directors etc. The first is commonly referred to as the Gender Confidence Gap. Studies show that women are more likely to underestimate their abilities than men, for example if a woman thinks she‚Äôs bad at something she‚Äôs probably actually average, if she thinks she‚Äôs average at something she‚Äôs probably actually quite good. When applying for jobs most women will only apply if they meet almost all criteria, whereas men will apply if they meet a lot less, say 60-75% of criteria. It‚Äôs easy to see why women have this confidence gap, imagine from birth being told things like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôre a girl!‚Äù  ‚ÄúYour pretty good, for a girl‚Äù ‚Äúyou throw, like a girl.‚Äù You hit, like a girl‚Äù et cetera et cetera. Research shows by the time girls hit puberty their confidence plummets compared to their male peers. The second problem is gender bias. Whether conscious or unconscious, certain roles have deep ingrained gender stereotypes, for example when I say nurse, most people think ‚Äòfemale‚Äô when I say pilot they think ‚Äòmale‚Äô  and screenplay writer is a traditionally male dominated job so naturally screenplays by men will get read/picked up more often. 
To solve these problems will take a massive social shift in how we think about, talk about and treat girls and women along with programs in schools and workplaces to build females confidences back to match their male peers. Men can help by being champions for the women in their life. If your daughter/sister/mother etc says ‚Äòoh I can‚Äôt do that‚Äô, tell them they can. If they underestimate their abilities, tell them. Give them the confidence back that society has taken from them. Then maybe those women who think they're ""not bad"" writers will realize they're actually good and really could make a career out of it.",0.9879,385

"Well, it's pretty simple: In the end, it's all about the money, and female actresses don't secure box office success on the same level as men -mostly. In the last 10-15 years, the list of the 50 most sought after actors/actresses only had like 5-11 women on it, which says a lot. Male actors tend to draw more people from both genders to the cinema, because women are more inclined to go see a movie with an actor, just because they think he is pretty. But men don't go see a movie with a female actress because they find her pretty. If the movie seems good, then they'll go -So it's a more tough crowd. 
And when it comes to equal pay, the men just know their worth, and so does the studio apparently. They know that they can demand high payment, because they are more dier to the movies box office performance. Just like Mark Wahlberg's HUGE payment for the reshoots he just did. He knew his worth, and negotiated a contract which illustrated thar. Michelle Williams could've tried the same, but didn't, since she probably knows that she is NOT worth as much.

I think another part of the problem overall is that a lot of people just give lip service or jump on the bandwagon of movements because its easy to do and they do not come up with real solutions a prime example is Natalie Portman complaining at the Globes that all the directors were male meanwhile her own production company has hired only 1 female director (hint it was Portman her self) and she signed a petition trying to get Polanski pardoned from his child rape charges while espousing women empowerment and anti harassment warcrys like a medieval tribesmen.",-0.9201,193

I am, after all, listening to understand - not just listening to respond - and I'd ask that you do the same. :) On your point about comedic value... I understand what you're saying, and I think you could likely be right about that. My argument is that there is plenty of other comedic material - and I don't see the point of bringing up controversial issues like this if you are not actually trying to make an argument (but rather just being dismissive to all those who disagree or have not yet grasped the issue). Also, I have no doubts that women have been treated horribly and in a repulsively unequal manner in the past - I am merely debating the point (as a writer who has studied many scripts before) that modern films are written in a misogynistic way - as I have not seen this myself. This is exactly why I'd ask that someone like Jessica Chastain could point out real, mainstream movies where this is actually the case, as opposed to just making up stuff (which is not really that convincing)",-0.0534,227
"anti cap I didn't equate the two. Please stop grasping at straws. I said that if she wants to make a point, she should use evidence.

Also, I made that sheep comment as a response to your comment (but I wasn't calling you a sheep). This I have already said. Discussion doesn't start until there is a response to a response. Calling a general group of people ""jump-on-the-bandwagon sheep"" is much better than personally attacking someone by calling them ""fucking stupid"". The latter is just disrespectful, and you only are willing to say that because you are hiding behind a keyboard. On your point about discourse, I did not see how it was relevant to the debate (which is why I didn't respond to it). This may be because you didn't properly explain. Or perhaps I'm just ""fucking stupid"".",0.7778,209

"anti cap If sexism in language and therefore film scripts  is as subtle and trivial as you claim it to be (so much so that half of the population doesn't even notice it), then Jessica Chastain was making an incredibly gross mischaracterisation. She was implying that women in scripts are underwritten, not that ""discourse is controlled by those in power and therefore the entirety of language is sexist"". I was merely saying, regardless of whether it's true or not, that using an actual script, rather than a made up one, would actually make the point. You say that she is ""using her own struggles"" to ""entertain"" the audience - implying that there MUST be such real examples around somewhere (if she's had real struggles like whatever is depicted here)... then why not provide these examples? If she wanted to be funny, THAT would have been funny. Or maybe she could have shown that example first, to prove her point, then go for the exaggerated comedy. No one is giving any specific examples, or any evidence... which is beginning to make me feel like... perhaps there isn't any! You, on the other hand, are saying that there are no specific examples, because just, you know, language is sexist. I'm not sure I'm convinced about that. Also, as a general tip for debating online like we are now - I wouldn't refer people to other sources to explain your points for you. People are generally pretty lazy, and this also makes it seem like you can't be bothered explaining your own point. Also, he was a Marxist - so already lost a little legitimacy in my head there. After reading through some summaries of his analysis of discourse, I am inclined to agree with what he is saying. You have persuaded me on that front - that those in power have some kind of impact on the construction of society, and therefore discourse. Yes, a very small portion of this discourse and this affected language may make it into filn scripts. What I do not understand is how you are supporting Jessica Chastain with that point. It seems slightly irrelevant. She was trying to make a point about blatant sexism, and blatant lack of character development for females - not the subtle ways power relationships between men and women impact the formation and evolution of language.",0.8693,447
