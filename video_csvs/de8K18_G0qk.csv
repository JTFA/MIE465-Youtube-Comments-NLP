Always have been a fan. I love this new song. Very relatable to my own life. Makes me cry to watch and listen. I have been there. This is a carbon copy of my life/childhood. I am glad to see you returning to your roots all the way around. Can't wait for more. I still do not understand how you have not blown up and taken the world by storm!! You are nothing short of amazingly talented.,0.8904,90

"George Nelson  -  It certainly wouldn‚Äôt surprise me... they are good friends, and were label mates at the beginning of both of their careers. There is an older song of his that they have performed together called ‚ÄúRush‚Äù, you should check out the video if you haven‚Äôt already seen it... it‚Äôs one of my all time favorites!!! I actually got to meet him at one of Katy‚Äôs concerts, when I ran into he and Markus Molinari, who is one of Katy‚Äôs BFFs, in the lobby! They were both as nice as could be!!!",0.9466,120
