"Additionally, I wish there was an accurate definition of carcinogen and cancer itself circulating. Cancer is not how we might commonly think of disease.

Cancer is the uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells. Cancer occurs when the normal 'life and death cycle' of a human cell has gone awry. Human cells grow by making copies of our DNA and dividing. The more a cell has to divide, the more likely it is to divide abnormally (abnormally = incorrect copy of DNA). 

Reasons you would need new cells are any injuries or strains you put on your body. The world of carcinogens then begins to make a lot more sense. 

Smoking is detrimental to lung health - smoke kills healthy lung cells which puts a strain on remaining healthy lung cells to copy DNA, divide and replace dead lung cells. So, smoking is a carcinogen.

Heavy sustained drinking can hurt liver health - the more liver cells that die, the more work remaining liver cells have to copy DNA, divide, and grow.

The crux of carcinogens are the unnecessary burden they put on the body to create more cells; More division = higher percentage of developing cancer.

Anyhow, maybe that's useful or interesting information, or maybe not. Sorry if it was the latter.",-0.9874,239

"I know I might as well be saying this to a brick wall, but if you do even some cursory research (sensationalist articles do not count) you'll find a wealth of well-supported scientific articles on the topic of SLS and SLES disproving these doomsday beliefs that too many people have. Yes, they are chemicals. Essential oils and apple cider vinegar are also made of chemicals. Everything is made of chemicals. Adding sulfates makes less product go further so you don't have to consume as many resources to do the same thing. Do your own research: try googling ""SLS SLES human toxicity"", ""SLS SLES aquatic toxicity"", ""SLS SLES biodegradability"", etc. to avoid getting heavily biased articles. If you're convinced that scientific articles are propaganda, try learning about experimental design and decide for yourself if the scientific articles you find are actually untrustworthy. Consider what impacts your purchases have on the earth, and weigh the costs and benefits of traditional and alternative purchases: crunchy hair vs. dead coral reefs, slightly more difficult cleaning routines vs. uninhabitable tropical regions, etc.. Doubt everything, do your own research, and draw your own conclusions. Learn everything you can learn about the world around you and make informed choices.
