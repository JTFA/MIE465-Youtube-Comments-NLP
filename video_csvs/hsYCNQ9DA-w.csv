Suddenly there's a documentary, everyone knows his name and these guys are like ""hey, I know him."" No proof of wrong doing. No corroborating stories. One guy recanted then re-accused.",-0.1779,97

"That research study on early childhood development via Sesame Street seems like complete nonsense. Quite a stretch to suggest any sort of causation from the show. Good lessons sure, but having a significant impact on success later in life just isn't going to be the case. The amount of variables in this world are too great to suggest causations like this and frankly popular media always using it as if its proper evidence has gotten out of hand and needs to stop. There are things we can study then there's trying to link people over one thing they had in common at some point in their lives.",0.9773,113
