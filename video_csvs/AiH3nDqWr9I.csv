They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""fedora family"" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself.

Hey mat pat. I have a theory of doof secret son,0.0,12
"Hey matpat, I don't know if you'll ever see this comment, but for the people who do, I think the OWCA are copying more than just Dr.Doof's inventions. In the phineas and ferb movie across the second dimension, phineas and ferb enter perrys lair where they find all there old gadgets. Perhaps the OWCA knows about the skill the kids posses in inventing machines that could be useful for the organization. But because they can't hire them because because the parents would never approve of a dangerous job such as that(also because of child labor and lawsuits and all that) so instead they have perry scan their inventions so that they may be used for the organization. This also explains why every time perry beats doof, whatever they built that day either gets destroyed or moved. It could be perry's orders to ensure that the invention ""disappears"" before the parents get home. The OWCA knows that if the parents find out about what the kids are doing. They may never be able to build anything that can be used for the foundation again. Welp, that's all I got to say. Anyway it's only a theory, it could be right, or it could be wrong, who knows?",0.0595,232
