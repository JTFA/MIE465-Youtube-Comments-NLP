Yeah. And then you buy a 128gb sd card, it arrives, the card says 128gb, windows says 128gb, but it can only store 8gb before it crashes.
Wish is just a swindle and should really be boycotted. But it sure makes for a fun video.

Adding the watch to your phone plan? They just give nano to micro adapters away for free here. That guy made a great deal on you, haha. 

As for the GoPro Clone: SJCam. 80 bucks. Works almost as good as the real deal. No really, it's actually very good. Been using one for years.
It has the same start-up sound, but the video quality is much better.
Reason your GoPro looks different is that the fake is modeled after the old GoPro looks. They're pretty much identical.

So except for the normally priced projector, nothing really did as promised. Lovely :D.",0.9891,181

"As a person that has flown model aircraft for more than 25+ years, I find it frightening that people think they can buy  a drone and be able to fly it right off the bat.  While a lot of them do have auto leveling and auto return home, you still have to learn how to fly them. Even when it says its a toy, its a flying object that can put someones eye out. Learn how to fly before you take stuff like that out into the public and just turn it on and see what happens.

Now with my rant being over, I 100% agree with you on the crap that comes from wish. Its all knock offs and its a huge hit or miss on if anything is good.Ive bought a couple dozen things from them and have maybe 5 things that I actually liked. A wish tip for you. Look at the related tab for same items. there are wide range in prices that different places sell for. that 13 dollar watch you could have gotten for $3 and so on. Overall I am not a big fan of wish because the products are extremely hit or miss. Just fyi, my watch couldnt sync with my android phone because it needed a special app to be loaded on your phone and the address in the instructions were not valid. In fact, a youtube search brought up many things and all of them failed so I know how you feel about the watch lol.",0.8333,278

Battery life when paired with my phone was about 8 hours, so it would barely get me through the day if I kept it on charge all night!  It had a speaker that you couldn't hear unless you were in a soundproof room.  If you allowed the battery to stay dead more than a few hours the clock would have to be re-set, which was awkward.  With Bluetooth off, battery life was about 36 hours.  It had some functions that didn't need Bluetooth.  A thermometer- that always read 29.3C; A pedometer- that counted some steps twice and others not at all; An altimeter that I never did really test.  About the only things it did OK were tell time and calculator.  Just like a dollar-store watch with a 2-year battery!  I asked for and got a refund without even having to send it back.

I bought and set up the watch for my 8 year old nephew. 
The smartwatch can be paired with your phone through bluetooth but you cannot use the internet from your phone. You can use the watch without a cellular phone using a separate sim card but it only works on a 2G network. If 2G is not available by your cellular company in your area it won't work. This smartwatch was specifically made for the Asian market which has unlimited 2G internet. It's a good kids toy.

It's a shame that this video wasn't done properly as far as a true review of each of the products. The sad thing is that the electronics you already own that you bought here in the states do you really think that they didn't come from the exact same places you purchased these items off of wish from? Another thing to know is you didn't even give each of the products a fair chance as far as actually knowing how to use them. The Drone I'll bet if you actually looked into it requires an app for you to see the footage on your phone from the camera. Anybody that owns a drone will tell you it takes practice and time to control it with any amount of accuracy. The glasses I'm betting probably worked as well. I have those exact same glasses and it took a few minutes of messing with it and trying different things before I realized it actually did work and quite well. the projector was a waste of money right out of the gate. You can buy an American-made item that has more features for less than what you paid for that stupid thing. GoPro knockoff what's really funny about that is don't you think that your GoPro was probably made in the same exact place that camera came from. It may not have had the exact same picture quality but it was in the neighborhood. Another item you didn't give a fair chance to. And lastly the watch. I purchased a phone that I had the exact same issues with the SIM card. I bet you that if you had exchanged the SIM card it would have fixed the problem and you would have had a fine working little watch. This video could have been very informative if you had done your research and put in some effort to learn how to use each of the products. I am not endorsing nor am I saying that all the products purchased from over there or of any kind of quality but I promise you that all the products we have here in the states come from there as well.
