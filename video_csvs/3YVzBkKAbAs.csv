"This video made me happy and sad. It made me think about our old dogs Minime and Buddy who we had to get rid of when we got kicked out of our house. We got to keep our other dog Jenne though and she is still with us now at 6 years old. My old dog Minime was a husky black lab mix and my old dog Buddy was my best friend and a shi shu chihuaha mix ( i butchered the spelling). I thought about any dog I had dying and how I kept my dog Buddy's collar when we got rid of him. It made be cry because I realized we didn't get to keep my dog Minime's collar. My brother's/family dog Minime was the best dog ever, he could be annoying sometimes when he would bark really loud at night outside, we had to keep him out there since he wasn't potty trained well, but he was also fiercly loyal. One time he attacked a porcupine because he was trying to protect us and we had to take him to the vet to get the needles out, he was 13 years old when we got rid of him and I found out he did get a home which makes me so happy even if he has possibly passed away now. My dog Buddy was my first pet that was truly mine besides a gold fish and I had him for 3 years until we got rid of him, he would be 7 right now. I remember the day I got him perfectly and how I picked him because he was so different from the rest, I later found out he was the runt. Soon he started losing fur and his skin was getting all flaky and I realized he had been bred badly by his past owners. I felt terrible because we couldn't afford to take him to the vet to get him fixed because it was too much money. I never even got to tell him goodbye because one day I came home from school with my friend and he was gone and a black hamster I named Lusa was left behind to replace him, but I knew he could never be replaced. I told Buddy everything and I would always play with Minime outside. I miss my dogs, they're by best friends. When I started crying over this my black lab Jenne came over and rested her head on my leg and sniffed my face every now and then like she was kissing me until I was better. I've never had to deal with a dog dying, but I've had to deal with giving both my dogs away and never being able to say goodbye to either of them. I'm sorry for rambling but I just wanted you to know how deeply this video touched me and that I have loved all your videos ever since I subbed to you. My dog now, Jenne, is still laying in my room with me as I type this and she says hello to you. By the way, I know all about cuddling heavy dogs, Jenne loves to cuddle.",0.9938,567
