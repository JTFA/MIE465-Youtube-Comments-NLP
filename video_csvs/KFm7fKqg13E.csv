"""When you talk about corporations reinvesting that means they can expand their company which they need more manpower/employees to operate it and can pay more. ""

Lol, no it doesn't! I work as a financial manager and plant accountant for a manufacturing company based in the US. Those investments will go towards capital fixed assets that aim at displacing workers, not adding them. The goal of companies is to automate and reduce overhead related to employee wages, benefits, worker's comp, etc. You have no idea what you're talking about.

""This text cat will benefit 80 percent of the population. If you‚Äôre living off welfare or unemployed a course it will not help you.""

Where did I say these tax cuts benefit people on welfare or who are unemployed, or where did I say they should? I didn't. The Republican politicians are claiming this will benefit the middle-class, but it won't, at least not in a meaningful or lasting way. In the long run these tax cuts will hurt the middle class. The tax bill benefits the ultra rich significantly more than anybody else, and the benefits are set to last indefinitely. Whereas the tax cuts for the middle-class are set to last only 8 years, before they increase to levels higher than today. This is basically a loan that middle-class people are being given, one in which they'll have to pay back with interest in the future.",0.8919,270

"+Ducati M   The policies under Reagan are what has led to the huge wealth inequality in America. Reagan destroyed the middle class. And it's the middle class that this debate is all about. It doesn't matter how great the economy is or how much it's growing if the lions share of those gains are realized by the top 1% of the population, which is what's happening, and that's what will continue to happen based on this most recent tax bill.

You're not seeing the forest beyond the trees. You're seeing that you might get a $1,000 or $2,000 tax break for the next 8 years and think that's awesome, while what this is really doing is exponentially benefiting the wealthy is the country and continuing to create a greater divide between the top 1% and everybody else, leading to further social unrest.",0.9435,157

""FYI, the middle class will get the tax cuts to.""

SMH ... I KNOW THAT! The POINT is that the ultra rich receive MILLIONS in benefits, while the middle class receives enough to afford a new TV. Oh and by the way, the tax cuts for the ultra rich are indefinite, while the tax cuts for the middle class only last for 8 years, afterward their tax rates increase to higher rates than exist today. Therefore these tax cuts are basically a loan that you'll have to pay back later, with interest.",0.9128,159
"+Ducati M """"these tax cuts Will help companies make more money which will hire employees and those employees will take home more money because of the tax cuts.""

Lol, you're so clueless. Large corporations that make more money from these tax cuts are going to either invest it into the business, or will engage in stock splits and dividends to investors. If it takes two people to build a widget, a company is not going to hire a 3rd worker just because they have more money.

I'm going to copy and paste this reply from Max Flight who commented below, because he's 100% right:

""The problem with this 21% corporate tax rate is that big executives don't just get more money and think, ""hey I can create jobs and raise my workers' wages to offset the extra profits were bringing in!!!"" That is a fantasy. It'll just never happen. That's counterproductive. Businesses are not obligated to hire people. This bill is essentially a glorified gamble on this fantasy. The only obligation a business has is to make as much money as possible for its shareholders. Adding jobs and raising salaries to offset new gains makes that harder. Corporations just reinvest it in their companies, or invest it in stock and become richer. Having extra cash is a guaranteed asset. Adding a worker, who can do the work, but can get sick, has feelings and can file complaints and lawsuits, have family and emotional problems, perform badly, etc., is however bad it may sound, adding an expendable asset that can quickly become a liability. Put yourself in the position of a rich executive. Ask yourself. Would you rather take the extra cash and reinvest? Or would you rather hire people to eat up the extra cash you're making. It's a simple concept, as old as time itself.""",-0.839,356
"+Ducati M You're still not getting it. Based no your 'logic' nobody should be charged any taxes. Nobody is saying that the middle-class should be taxed more, what they're saying is that this tax cut exponentially benefits the rich as opposed to the middle class, so while you may think it's great that you're getting a $1,000 tax cut, all it's doing is further increasing income inequality in america because the ultra rich are getting millions of dollars worth of tax cuts.",0.8126,92

"The Trump Tax Bill is the nail that will seal the coffin containing the well being of the average American. The corporations who harbor billions and billions of dollars in international accounts are being given even more money than ever before in history. They already have most of the nations's wealth. If the billionaires in this country were taxed fairly, we could pay off the national debt, fund essential programs for the masses, and put more money in the hands of the citizens by freeing the unimaginably huge amounts of money that the top 1% are hoarding. The corporations are already paying incredibly low taxes because they are able to take advantage of tax loopholes which were intentionally placed into almost every pertinent legislation on taxation of Corporations and their Holdings. The average Corporation in this country actually pays an average of 6% in taxes. With the new tax plan, using existing loopholes and crooked legislation which is geared at making the rich in this country even richer, will allow corporations to operate almost tax free. Since they have the majority of the money in this country, the entire burden of paying for everything needed to run our country, such as infrastructure, public programs, and programs designed to help the people living in poverty, will have to be paid by the very small amount of money that can be raised by taxing the masses.  There are over 45 million people in the United States who are living in poverty according to the government. My guess is that this number is much higher, but it just shows where our country is headed. This tax plan will destroy the middle class, and the gap between the rich and poor will be phenomenally huge. The people who are sponsoring this act are insatiably greedy criminals who do not seem to understand that they are ending our Republic. Did you know that the 8 richest people in this country have more money than the bottom 50% of the world?! There is so much money in this country, that everyone could live a prosperous and happy life if the government would protect the 99% of there constituents who are just trying to pay their bills. It seems to me that most Americans cannot even begin to understand just how insanely rich some of these people are. They have so much money that they would still be billionaires even if they gave billions of dollars to the government's budget, which would help save America. Unfortunately these wealthy, greedy individuals do not care about anybody other than themselves and their insanely rich friends. This is the truth even though many people probably don't fully comprehend this. These rich people have millions of times more money than you do, and they want to pay less taxes which are required in order to keep our country financially stable. It is absolutely unacceptable that 45 million Americans are living in poverty. Trump's tax plan will increase this number faster than you will ever expect. Mark my words, this plan is the beginning of the end of the middle class.",0.9875,563

"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  

Jesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... 

Jesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.

Jesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.‚Äù  NKJV

Acts 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV

Jesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP

Jesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP

Romans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúWhoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV

Romans 10:13 states; For ‚Äúwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù  NKJV

1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV

And REPENT...

Acts 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God‚Äôs purpose for their lives].  AMP

Jesus said in Mark 1:15 ‚ÄúThe [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self‚Äîyour old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God‚Äôs purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].‚Äù  AMP

1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV

From what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say ‚Äúok, ok, it was a lie‚Äù.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.

Please get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you‚Ä¶

And don‚Äôt ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.

Republican Paul Ryan, like most other members of the U.S. Congress, is a millionaire.

Christa Patton is 68 years old. She is frail and no longer able to leave her home. She lives on a fixed income. Patton told Van Jones on a recent episode of his CNN show ""The Messy Truth"" that she would not be able to eat without the Meals on Wheels program.

Paul Ryan is the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. By his own account, in college he used to hang out with his friends and drink beer while sharing his dreams of cutting Medicaid. When Ryan was 15 years old, his father died from an alcoholism related heart attack. Ryan and his family then received his father's Social Security survivor's benefits. Ryan used that money to attend college. This was not the only money that Paul Ryan received from the federal government. His family built its wealth from receiving government contracts.

Like his idol Ayn Rand (who argued against the very idea of government and the commons yet received Social Security and Medicare), Paul Ryan has combined meanness, cruelty and callousness toward the weak and the vulnerable with gross and unapologetic hypocrisy.

Republicans like Ryan ‚Äî along with the millionaires and billionaires who comprise Donald Trump's Cabinet and inner circle ‚Äî literally want to take food, shelter and health care away from poor people like Christa Patton. Today's Republicans view these Americans as useless eaters to be disposed of by means both passive and active.",-0.871,335
