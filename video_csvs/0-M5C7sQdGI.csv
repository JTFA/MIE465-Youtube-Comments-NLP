"Well said.The content is good and all,but the whole concept of its acquisition is too damn annoying. That's why i stopped playing this shit of an excuse game called GTA Online. You literally had to grind for days if not weeks just to get one out of the twelve items you wanted,not for this DLC,not for the previous one,but for almost all of them. It was more and more frustrating the more time you were spending to grind and getting crumbs as the results of it.

Heists don't actually help you unless you get 50-55% and above as the host,since the cost for the startup is bigger than the profit you can have in the end,and I'm sure I'm not the only one who had people quiting with the first fail or death.I was playing the classic created missions in hard difficulty in order to make money,since nothing else proved to be worth it.

Before the Gunrunning DLC came out,i was lucky enough to get in a lobby with a modder who increased my total money from 1M into 26M.I was really pleased when that happened because I had enough to spend for a DLC I was actually hyped for it (I like anything Military related). But here's the sad part,one hour before the release, Rockstar removed my modded cash.I got really mad that moment,since some of my friends had a significant waaay higher amount of money (100M+) and they evaded the reset.

Nonetheless I had to sell some of my unused vehicles in order to be able to buy a Bunker,but even then,I realized the Gun and Vehicle customization needed another purchase in order to apply them,and so did the upgrades in order to unlock them.Also the upgrade meter would only be filled if you were online,which is very time consuming.That's where I said enough is enough.

2K is copying Rockstar and vice versa.Take a look at NBA 2K18 which came out this year. You get a full priced AAA game and you need another full priced game in microtransactions in order to upgrade your player so you can play decently.Grinding there is also impossible,or better stated,extremely time consuming to the point you'll regret it later on,as you've wasted hundreds of hours for something someone just paid in an instant. 

I would rather get a priced DLC that's optional and has content immediately ready,rather than get a free DLC that needs a huge load of in-game money in order to be accessible.I don't think everyone wants to pay 38 euros for 3,5M or even 75 euros for 8M.That analogy is simply insane and an obvious cash grab technique.",-0.0647,504
