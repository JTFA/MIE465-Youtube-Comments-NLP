You liberals love to tout that any opposition is fear but when Hobby Lobby wanted to make political decisions you stomp your feet and cried like children.

If Pepsi wants to get political then let them stop making Cola and get into politics they sell a product they Market a product and they are specifically targeting one group of people however if you notice and you look clear enough without your blinders you will see that they did not include people of religious Faith. New paragraph. How much do you want to bet if this was a Baker's commercial for cake making you liberals would be up in arms because they didn't include everyone.
