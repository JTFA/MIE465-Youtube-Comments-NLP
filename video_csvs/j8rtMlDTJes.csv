"Actually it's because we don't hold your productions to ransom.  Hire an American and by the fourth year of a show it's ""I want 1 million per episode or I walk!"" or if your movie is lucky enough to get a sequel it's ""I want 25 million or you can find someone else!""

Well Hollywood did learn and what they learned was that it's better to just find someone else before you've made the first movie and to make sure that that someone else wasn't born in to an American middle-class republican family and taught from a young age that money and making as much as you possibly can of it is the sole purpose of life.

Andrew Lincoln is in his 8th year of making The Walking Dead and yet he and the hundreds of other Brits that dominate American TV probably don't earn in a year what the cast of The Big Bang Theory make each and every episode and yet he could still afford a private jet if he wanted to.

The American dream used to be joining the middle class but now the American dream is joining the 1% and it's going to make that country implode :/",0.4468,212
