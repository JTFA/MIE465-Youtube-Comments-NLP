"Hello Nikkie, i know it sounds strange and maybe unappropriate under this video, but i wanted to ask to a makeup artist for ages if u can do a video on ""How to cover piercing holes or scars"". It would be interesting to see how to correct this problem with makeup because the only reason i don't do piercing on my face is because i'm scared it would stay the hole forever and cannot do anything for it!!! 
I think lot of ppl would like this kind of video. :)
You are amazing!! xoxo",0.9454,105

Hi Nikki! I know that I'm watching this video really late lol 😂 but I just wanted to say that I love the way that they both look on you! The Maybelline is a more matte finish and I'm an oily skinned girl so I've been watching the videos for this foundation to get a bunch of opinions.,0.8564,61
Hi Nikkie from Phil.Crossing my fingers so much that you can read my comments and thoughts about you. I live in a country which is very hot and humid so I prefer to use BB Cream and a bit of concealer together for the BB Cream I use the BB Holic its a korean brand which is very cheap but gives you that fresh and natural look and for concealing some spots I use the fit me concealer. As of the moment I dont have any high coverage foundation to play with so I hope I could play arround for those two foundations but nonetheless just watching you creatively play arround with make ups just makes me happy ☺,0.9853,121
