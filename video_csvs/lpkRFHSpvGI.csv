Ahh guys that fisa memo is very damaging to the dem party. I MEAN wow ! If I were you I would play ignorant of the corruption and the treasonous acts of dem party.

It was stated that this memo is just the tip of the corruption of the liberal progressive dems . I hope you and the late night hosts are not mentioned in any other memos .

Bush was worse but Trump has already been better than both and i'm not even a republican.
I've decided that you people have such low expectations of blacks that when you hear one who doesnt speak in ebonics you inflate his abilities tenfold. 
He didnt end any of these awful wars, he actually expanded them into new places.
He didnt do shit about the war on drugs. He did fuck all for the black community.
He actually ENCOURAGED the importation of poverty from mexico. He resigne the Patriot Act. He barely did anything about israels rampant abuses of the arabs and american taxpayers. Should we discuss the insane debt that will probably be the end of us?
