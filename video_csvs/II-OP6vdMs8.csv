"I have great respect for SamBee, she was one of my favourites on the Daily Show and been an avid fan of her current show, always wanting to hear her stance of many issues, especially giving a new light over the difficulties of being a woman, but honestly she and many other women are unable to admit that they have no control over the #MeToo movement, that's become nothing more than a witch hunt now, where anyone can just make an allegation with the hashtag, and it will be picked up by the media, without anyone trying to check if it's true or false...even if the accused denies, it doesn't matter as everyone will automatically consider him guilty and damage his career, while the accuser will never suffer any sort of backlash, even if he/she lied!
I also wonder if at any point do you think that women may also have been part of that abuse of power (over both men and women)? Even if it's a small percentage, it's still something that exists, and it's actually harder for men to come forward in those cases.

I‚Äôm sure Vladimir Putin‚Äôs laughing somewhere as he watches democracy and the western world self destruct.....

Another reason a woman will never lead the world.... lack of logic and foresight

#metoo is kinda like tossing a baby a chew toy to distract it for a short while before it starts to cry again
