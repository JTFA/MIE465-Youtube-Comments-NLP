"derekpaul1113 Also, while the original wrench WAS hardened, it was hardened to a much lower degree than a knife would need to be, since a wrench must be 3/4 flexible and 1/4 hard, while a knife must be 3/4 hard and 1/4 flexible (these numbers are made up, just to give you an idea of the difference between the two). In general, hardness and flexibility are on opposite sides of the scale. Making a good tool means finding a good spot on that scale so that the final product has the qualities that make the most sense, considering the tool's purpose. A good knife should be both reasonably hard (so it cuts well) and flexible (so the blade ""bends"" instead of snapping when stress is applied). Quenching (rapid cooling of incandescent metal) makes it very hard, so much so that if you were to drop the knife at this stage it would very likely shatter, almost like glass. This is why tempering is required, so that it loses some of its hardness but becomes much less fragile.",0.4445,204
"derekpaul1113 Heating it in the forge makes it soft so it's more easy to work with. After the near-final shape is achieved, quenching and tempering are required to give the steel hardness, flexibility and edge retention.",0.7056,41
