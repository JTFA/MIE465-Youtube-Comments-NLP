"Lyrics



[Verse 1]

I feel like Atlas, I got my back stressed
You wanna grab this, you don't understand this
I keep it oppressed, work on my realness
Reading my manifest, I'll address your request


I've been waking up drenched in sweat
All my dreams, full of my regret (my regret)
I keep hearing what my mother said
Eyes are open, all I see is red

I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova
I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova

[Verse 2]
Look overhead at the stars and the ocean
Foggy emotions, moments, erosion
This supernova could cause a commotion
My minds of the notion, you'll still be my motive
I've been, I've been so fucked in my head
I've been going through phases, I'm just going through phases
Don't know what this craze is
When's the last time someone said shit? (ohhh)
Walking through your mazes
When's the last time someone meant it? (ohhh)


I've been waking up drenched in sweat
All my dreams full of my regret (my regret)
I keep hearing what my mother said
Eyes are open all I see is red

I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova
I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova

[Flute Solo]

I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova",0.7713,341
