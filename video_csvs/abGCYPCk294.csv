Maybe if they stopped trying to put out team up movies and focus on a solo batman film that has a coherent and engaging story, DC may gain back some credibility. Look at Wonder Woman. The moment they released a movie that focused on telling a single story for one character, it was so much better.

"As a massive DC fan, I was on the fence about the reactions at first. I'm quite happy with the general reactions being positive, but ""fun"" and ""funny"" are words I hoped never to really associate with the DC movies (I quite loved the dark and fairly serious tones of the previous entries), though I figured it was inevitable with the successes of Wonder Woman and the critical failures of Man of Steel and BvS. ""Thin plot"" sounds like a step back from BVS and Man of Steel, and Wonder Woman. 

I'm not so much on the fence anymore, but I am still disheartened to see the words ""thin plot"" be used to describe the movie. I can suck up the tone change. Wonder Woman was an awesome movie, and that was fun and funny. I just hope that DC doesn't indulge in Marvel's brand of humor, not that there's anything wrong with their humor, I just think sometimes it's used in a way that prevents the movies from having real moments at times.

"Didn't BvS and Suicide Squad have overwhelmingly enthusiastic social media reactions (I might be wrong)? And look how those movies turned out. I don't know, John. These lukewarm (though to your point, slightly positively slanted) reactions combined with the extremely late review embargo lift has me thinking this is going to be another 30% RT type deal. All of the positive nuggets in those reactions are basically the same generic things people wrote about either BvS or SS. Many people said SS was ""fun but a mess"", and the DCEU has never had a problem with THE PERFECT casting of their characters (ok, except for Jesse Eisenberg's LL). What they've almost always struggled with though is telling a cogent story and/or giving their characters believable motivations. Based on the initial reactions, sounds like JL is another typical DCEU product.

Also, don't movies with high RT scores always start out with REALLY high scores that slowly drop and level off as the more casual audiences go see said movies? If even the more hardcore comic book movie fans (the ones who have seen JL at this point) are essentially going ""meh"", I don't see how JL will have any chance at being well received by the casual moviegoer.

I'll keep my thoughts about how I think the WB/DC execs are a bunch of overpaid f*ck ups who like to meddle too much in properties they clearly have no idea about until I've seen JL for myself. If it turns out that I don't have to rant about that again, it'll be a good day.",0.9897,302

"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?

Take a moment and consider the state of our world:

-The global economy is out of control.


-The Middle East is at the tipping point.


-The world hates Israel.


-There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.


-There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).


-Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.


-Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.


-Perversion is running rampant.


-The weather is out of control.


-We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.


-Education is in the toilet.


-Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.

... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.

None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.

... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...

*Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.

Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say‚Ä¶?

What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?

Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.

As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!

Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...

Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.

Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...

Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought¬† you were so worth the effort that He created you!

Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?

If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:

Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""

Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""

Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""

Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""

C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""

Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""

Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""

Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""

Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.

Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.

Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""

Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",-0.9986,2022

Justice League seems to be thin on story, but rather fun and entertaining with a great group of characters. Why are people criticising it, saying that it has a poor story and villain. Half the marvel movies have shit villains and little in the way of story. I of course, would love Justice League to be as gritty and amazing as the Dark Knight, but realistically, we don't get comic book movies like that anymore. I think what I'm trying to say is, we need to lower our expectations a little. Fun and entertaining seems to be the direction these studios want to head for the superhero genre, and it probably wont change.",0.9706,148

"I'm sorry, but the fact that ""the reactions are generally good"" does not suffice in case of Justice League. And I like all 4 movies so far so - as far as the wider audience is involved - my bar is set pretty low. But this is in fact the Avengers of the DCEU. And the Avengers didn't need to be an Oscar winner either. I get it, you are still hopeful, but I think you are setting yourself up for disappointment.",0.9657,92

It‚Äôs so sad that your happy with the results but I guess your expectations were very low and if it better than Suicide Squad your happy!!lol Sorry I want better man.,0.9264,114
JL can't be just slightly above average for most fans. That's a really bad sign because WW would only be one out of five that really hit.

Bottom line is that the reviews are not magnificent, but their not bad.  The reviews seem positive and hopeful, no movie is perfect but if it's fun and heroic and entertaining (and that's what the reviews are stating)  people will like it and that will cause good word of mouth and repeat viewings.

"Mog Gles let me tell you I'm a movie buff and I have broad collection of movies from many countries. I would say some of my favorite movies are foreign movies  because they don't rely on special effects and explosions to entertain   but have a good idea on storytelling which I like. Marvel don't make great storytelling but they keep my interest with new innovative direction for comic book movies that keep me guessing and that's hard for me because I've seen a lot of movies. DC with Watchmen was the only innovative movie that I like from them and they just come out with very mediocre movies since. I'm not with John believing all DC have to do is to make ok movie is the wrong thing knowing it's a oversaturaion of superhero movies which will soon drain on movie goers if mediocre movies are made. I know these comic book movies love will some day end but DC will help it end sooner than later like they did with Batman and Robin. 

John is speaking just for his own personal taste which he's a big DC fan but movie makers have to make movies that will appeal to a bigger audiences and the audience that these movies are trying to target are young and they see Batman, Superman, Spider-Man on the same level as Xmen, Iron man, Black Widow which if you're are older is crazy. The later characters I just mentioned was not known in the average family household twenty years ago and now the kids are enjoying these new character along with already established iconic superheroes.",0.9902,282

I was always going to watch this movie and make up my own mind, no matter what the critics said. (And tbh, I find I don't generally agree with most of them anyway regarding the current DC movies.) But you can still get a good feel for what the movie is going to be like by reading all the reactions. For example, I'm expecting this movie to have more emphasis on 'light-hearted fun' than a deep exploration of character psychology and motive. This suggests to me that I'm likely to find this movie less to my tastes than the previous movies, and it's worth knowing that going in.",0.7643,125

""#JusticeLeague was entertaining for a good portion of the time though thin on storytelling and character development. There's more fun, humor and heart than BvS but it also feels very rushed with some scenes given zero time to develop""

""was entertaining for a good portion of the tiime"" means there were parts that were not. 


""thin on storytelling and character development, feels very rushed with some scenes given zero time to develop"" it's literally a continuation of BvS with some more jokes forced in.

"i just don't get it. how can you say that these early reactions are positive. if anything they are lukewarm. i feel like this is sugarcoating things about JL. like. people seem to be saying ""yeh, its okay"". the most important part of any movie (at least in my opinion) is story. but the characters are just a product of that story. they should be great within a story, and all should work together to make a solid overall film.. idk about most people, but when i go to see a story unfold, i want IT to be good, not just the people in it. i don't see JL having over a 70% on rt. i hope it does better. i want it to be good. i was looking forward to it. but my expectations are very very low now. this is very disappointing to hear. i mean, think back to bvs. most people, including john, said ""batman is great. they nailed his character in the movie"" but people still hated BVS. A well written or acted character isn't enough to save that movie, because the story didn't work. It was disliked, because to most people, is was described as JL is being described. a narrative mess. maybe they have cool action. maybe they nail more than one character. but over all. people want a good story. if the story doest work, people aren't going to like it. cool characters aren't going to be enough to save it. again, i hope it does. but, i do not at all believe in this film any longer.",0.9755,316

kittyhawk2000 i wanted to wait until after the RT score came out before i replied because that would prove my point. and surprise surprise JL ends up with 43% just as i predicted. the early reviewers were just brought in to view the movie early so that WB could use the good buzz to trick people into believing it wasn't a total pile of crap. NY Times captioned their review best 'Justice League - better than the last one' but only slightly lol,0.8796,90
kityhawk2000 and that's what happens when you put out a shit film. Even the people most loyal to you begin to waiver on their blind support. Even the people cherry picked to give JL good reviews had to consider what would happen to their credibility and reputations after the mainstream critics steamrolled the movie. But if you look at those who gave the movie a positive review on RT you will find it coincidental that a large number of them were the ones who got to screen the movie early,0.659,94
"kityhawk2000 it was never about making a prediction for John Campea. He has been desperately trying to calm people's minds so that they will go see JL in cinemas. That's why he lost his shit when RT delayed the announcement of the score. That's why he had to make this video to convince people the reviews were good, when anyone with a brain could see that those early reviewers were desperately trying to find anything positive to say about the film. John Campea and these other reviewers use this positive buzz to leverage themselves onto positions where they can get exclusive scoops and keep themselves relevant in the movie news industry.",0.4404,118
"kityhawk2000 my evidence is the fact that someone like John Campea who is a WB stooge will look at the early reviews and declare that JL will get 75% on RT, while I could sift through all the bs to realize it was always going to be in the 40% range. If you really pay attention to these things you will see the patterns emerging too",0.204,71
"kityhawk2000 of course these critics are cherry picked. The studios invite the persons who they believe will give them positive reviews to see the movie first, hoping it will create buzz and excitement. But even these people can't find many good things to say about the movie. So the regular, more unbiased critics will tear Justice League to shreds",0.8591,65
