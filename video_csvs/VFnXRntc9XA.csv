"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!

Jesus LOVES you! He is NOT angry at you, and neither does He hate you!

The Lord came down to die and rise again for ALL OF US!
So friends, don't let anyone or anything scare you from approaching Jesus today! He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him (John 6:37, paraphrased)

Repent and have faith in Jesus Christ!
He will save you from your sins, He will wash you and make you new! He will also deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth!

The Word says that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him will NOT perish but have everlasting LIFE! (John 3:16, paraphrased)
Hallelujah! So friends, don't ever think The Lord hates you -- The Word says otherwise!

So come to Him today as you are, and let Him make you new through the Power of the Holy Spirit!
He will deliver your from your sins! I've personally seen His Work in my own life!
I have been redeemed! Thank You, Jesus! This is why I preach!

You do not need a fancy prayer to make Him Lord of your life, just speak from the heart. You also do NOT need a lot of faith, the size of mustard seed is enough!

Shalom!",0.9732,268

"We know for a fact that Mr. White is capable of far worthier endeavours than those found in the supposed rhythm of this tune. Franz Ferdinand's latest effort, Always Ascending, was at first met by me with cold skepticism, but, in light of hearing this track, I realize I judged them far too harshly. Their album is the superior of the two. Much is catchier than Mr. W's latest offers.I've seen more than one comment for this video, and the other two releases from Boarding House Reach, comparing the songs to the likes of David Bowie. Not only is it untrue, but to even compare the artists is blasphemy.",0.872,126

NEVER STOP JACK!",0.7222,65
"You know what the problem with this music is? Great musicians, undoubted star singer, great instruments, but the period is wrong, it's not the same as  finding great sounding, live funk fusion from the early 70s, there's something that that period has that modern day retro nostalgia acts don't have. If you can't hear it yourself there's something wrong with your hearing",0.1531,70
