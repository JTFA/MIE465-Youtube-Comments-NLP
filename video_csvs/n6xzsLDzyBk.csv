andru osorio Sorry you don’t have an eye for talent but her fans loved her performance and she won tonight for Best Pop/Rock Female Artist. Sorry but I don’t think you really know what you’re taking about,0.9612,46
"andru osorio Um.....no lol I'm not a big fan of hers haha the fact that I asked a rhetorical question doesn't make me one. Hehehe this is why people say to never make assumptions. I appreciate her as an artist, but I am not one of her little monsters 😊",0.1999,55

"it seems that nominations are based on some unclear combo of Billboard stats - sales, chart positions,  radio play, social rankings, touring, blah blah. so it is perhaps unsurprising Gaga got a nomination this year - i’m sure Billboard found some way to justify her being a finalist. Once nominated, it appears to be a fan vote on the internet - her bots have been busy......",0.4939,77
it's not about her condition; the choreo is a bad creation. it doesn't need to be hard to look good.,0.0258,23
it's not the same. richie is her dance since the fame but he started choreographing in the artpop era. and honestly he's not that good as choreographer although he's a good dancer. i think gaga should hire someone else too. but since he's a friend she keeps him in charge. :sigh:,0.6164,58
