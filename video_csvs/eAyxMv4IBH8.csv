"Some years back I was asked to remove a water filter(reverse osmosis) from the office. The complaint was that it 'made the water taste like sh!t'. I was asked to reinstall it at another site. I asked ""if it makes the water taste bad why install it elsewhere?"" The response was 'we leased it, and are going to use it until we can return it'. The real ""problem"" was folks are used to the minerals in the tap water. Remove them with the filter, and the water 'tastes funny'.",-0.5411,113
