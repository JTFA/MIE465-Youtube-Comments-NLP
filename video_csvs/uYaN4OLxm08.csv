"Hmm. One of my cats sits at the kibble bowl, and refuses to eat until you pet her. If you stop, she stops, until she's had sufficient pettings to continue to eat solo.

I'm not sure if it's a request for permission to eat, or eating is uncomfortable, and she needs a distraction. We're told she has sensitive teeth.

The other will eat anything, except wet cat food. He'll lick the gravy, or jelly off, and spits out the meat. If we don't let him do that, he doesn't drink enough fluid, and gets blood in his pee from dehydration. Such a wasteful cat. :( The new cat soups are good, but expensive, and he still tends to leave the solid bits. <sigh>",-0.5237,145

I hate how it rips me off on stars though. I'll see the thing color up and it should score but a microdot size dot so small it's next to undetectable and you don't get the score. It needs to loosen up . If it were an arm of a star then OK but not something you can't even see. Still, it's a blast and my favorite. LOVE THOSE KITTIES! THANK YOU SIMON💕💞😻!",0.9883,128

I played the game got up into the 70s and got stuck on a hard level I’ve replayed it loads of times and have come to the conclusion you can’t beat it unless you use power ups. Now I understand you wish to make lots of money so making players need to buy things works out for you but I’d happily watch adverts to earn them like I can when I run out of lives but as I can’t I’ll never get passed this level as I won’t spend real money on a virtual item that will vanish in seconds. Also the wait timers on playing for keys is ridiculous as you actually have me stopping playing the game for six hours before I can progress I honestly don’t understand as I would have thought the more I’m playing and seeing ads the more money you’d get. Anyway I’ve now uninstalled the game which is a shame because I enjoyed playing it but as I can’t play anymore I’m not going to keep it,0.9743,201

She also acts like no one gave her dinner so that anyone who didn't feed her thinks she's still hungry. She's really good at it we need to get a sign to put up when she's been fed.
