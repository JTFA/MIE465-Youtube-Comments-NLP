"HAPPY XMAS (WAR IS OVER) SONGTEXT

So, this is Christmas
And what have you done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Lets hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones
The road is so long
And so happy Christmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is Christmas
And what have we done
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so happy Christmas
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

This song has been out longer than some of you have been alive. 2. The war on Christmas isnt real. Please stop. Xmas is just shortening of Christmas. And not all people celebrate Christmas as the birth of Christ. I was raised religious but, as an adult I'm an atheist. Christmas to me is spending time with family.
