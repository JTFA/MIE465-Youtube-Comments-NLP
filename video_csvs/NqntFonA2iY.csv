It's funny how people care so much about these idols but these comments won't do anything except put her career down the drain. You want to do that go right ahead. I'm not going to.

"If this conversation would have been between two people working in service, at the counter for instance, this would have been a quite regular one. Hating the ""extra"" customer. Having to deal with people on a regular basis, being intimidated (which is certainly happening to both subjects, the famous and the infamous) by the numbers and numbers of encounters, and whose job it is to constantly be nice towards other people, creates a certain dislike towards who they have to serve for. In the end this is what it gets down to - that actors do not only have to act at the set, but also, have two jobs, by being in service after work. 
The problem I see in this is that the person behind the counter can go home and just leave their job, as to a person of public interest this does never happen ( except of truely being in home - maybe - sometimes). Of course there is the issue of being immensely overpaid and therefore society thinks there is much more to be thankful about, but in the end this shows me, maybe others too, that in the very very end, it is only a job.. and only money. I come from a poor background and therefore I dont need explanation about ""only money"" but what it serves for is security and satisfaction, which I am also able to provide for myself, even if it is with a lot of effort. But what I am also thankful about, and even more, I get to be thankful about it every day, is that I can leave my workplace. Which does not necessarily mean that I hate my job, but in the end it is work. And anyone who has been working in service knows, that being polite and nice and in service to others, is very very tiring on an emotional level. Because nobody is always happy and greatful and that is what makes us human. I do believe that being overpaid and being a millionaire does not take this away from you, and if being an ungreatful person is the result of a hard day of work, this is what I can relate to. #relatable",0.9768,414

"Wow, Jlaw has had such a huge fanbase. She's one of few celebs who has been mostly loved by everyone for their offscreen as well as onscreens selves. How can you say such a thing about the people who MADE YOU FAMOUS. I get that celebs can find fan interaction annoying but you have  Adam Sandler in front of you who doesn't even know what to say to you with such answers...learn to be more gracious, Jlaw.",0.904,85
"Wow, she's a cunt.",0.1531,6
"Wow. Haha, remember when everyone thought she was so nice and down to earth? I can see where she's coming from, the attention would probably start to feel annoying when you're just trying to mind your own business and go about your day, but that's kinda the deal. You get acting jobs based on looks and talent, but you're made massively famous and wealthy by the people who like and support you and who pay to see your work. Bad idea to talk about how much you dislike meeting them, it heavily implies she doesn't even like her fans at all. Weirldly enough, people like likable people. She's right, she's a fucking cunt. Adam Sandler seems like a nice guy.",0.9571,135

You ARE incredibly rude and you become likable for movie roles, interviews and press conferences.
Adam might not make the best movies but he's a nice guy and cares about his fans, that's one of the reasons why he's still around (also, even Ridiculous 6 was better than half of Jennifer's movies, just saying).",0.8693,70

And she doesn't need ''defense'' because her fans respect her privacy and want all the best for her. the people that don't respect her privacy and only want a Selfie with her to post it on social media are not her real fans.. disgusting how many hearts she is breaking by laughing about her own fans because they feel connected to her.
I am a a fan since day one.. i watch all her movies in the Cinema, go to the premiers in my country and am happy whenever she is. She does not deserve me.",0.9538,133

"to be honest, being popular doesn`t mean you can approach them whenever you want. Think about it even as a normal citizen, if any guy you don`t know would come up to and say: Hey girl you are so pretty can we take a pic? You would say Umm nooo. Now imagine that happens everywhere and everytime. and some of them aren`t even respectful. sorry no one can judge them for being rude to protect themselves..NO ONE! Don`t complain like you know what these people go through you don`t. We all had a moment in our lifes where strangers approached us and we were not comfortable with it. And these people experience that all the time...that is just HUGELY ANNOYING and stressful. So let them be.",-0.264,153

your life changed cuz of your fans b****, stop being an ass and take a selfie, maybe your next movie will do better than Mother.
