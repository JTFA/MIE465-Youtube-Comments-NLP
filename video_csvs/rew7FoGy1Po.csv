"Greetings human beings of the comment section, i want to share a message: we're part of a strange event, we call it nature or the universe but these are just words, the real thing is not a name. Apparently there is something happening and we are a part of it. Also, we're in this event as humans, these kind of smart primates .. it's something very strange, nothing short of magic. If this makes you cringe, then I want you to reflect for a moment on the fact that there are trillions of tiny things in your head that we call neurons and there is something happening in there that we cannot even begin to explain and you, your reality, is that thing. This is not normal. 
Please reflect on this. We are all this insane event that is happening. You need to know this
