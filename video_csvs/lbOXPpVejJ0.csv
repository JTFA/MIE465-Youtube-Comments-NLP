"+Nick Jones   Not trippin at all. Just because Young is putting up numbers doesn't mean he's more NBA-ready than Sexton. He has a small frame, he's only like 6'1, he  has average athleticism by NBA standards,  average quickness by NBA PG standards, has a low release point on his jumper (can he even get that off against 6'3/6'4 PGs in the NBA?), doesn't seem to have a great vertical to play above the rim like Westbrook/Wall, and isn't explosive at all by NBA standards. If he can become a deadly outside shooter at the NBA level then he may have a chance to be a great PG, but if he ends up like how Jimmer did (great college shooter/scorer who had trouble getting his shot off in the NBA), he won't be all that good.  That said, if I were an NBA GM and in need of a PG, I'd opt for Sexton over Young.",0.8957,186

He's way better than Steph curry was in college Steph didn't start putting up star numbers till he was like 27 stop acting like he was a superstar since college trae young is more comparable too James harden or LeBron James true legends in my opinion based on style of play he draws contact everytime he goes to the rack Steph doesn't do that the only comparison is that golden State does mad illegal screens to get Steph open to chuck trae young actually takes smart open shots he's going to be way better than Steph curry he's going to be a true legend.,0.8885,105
"Hecular exactly bro. There were saying the same thing about Stephen but he ended up averaging damn there 18ppg his rookie season and if it wasn't for the injuries, he would've be a superstar earlier.

He’s like a Steph Curry/Kyrie Irving hybrid! Obviously his shooting and lightning quick release is reminiscent of Steph curry but his insane below the rim finishing abilities are like Kyrie Irving!

If the thunder don’t work out and we end up trading George or Melo for the Brooklyn pick then I’m hoping we pick this guy up! Obviously we’ll need to trade Russ too because ain’t no way in hell Russ and Trae Young is gonna work as a back court.

"Scot Shot Basketball he shoots a unconvincing 37% from 3 in the college level with a slow release, with lack of nba level quickness, height, weight or ball handling. For comparisons sake Monk who was drafted no 13 this year is shooting 33% in the nba when it was 40% in college. Lets just say this he doesnt have Donovan Mitchell scoring arsenal or Tatum nba ready size to be successfull at the next level also the Tatum and Donovan play elite defence.",0.2023,92
