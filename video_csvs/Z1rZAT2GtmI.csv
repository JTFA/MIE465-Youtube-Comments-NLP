"Adam ""Unlike sterilization, pasteurization is not intended to kill all micro-organisms (pathenogenic) in the food. Instead, pasteurization aims to achieve a ""log reduction"" in the number of viable organisms, reducing their number so they are unlikely to cause disease (assuming the pasteurized product is refrigerated and consumed before its expiration date). Commercial scale sterilization of food is not common, because it adversely affects the taste and quality of the product."" 

Thus meaning, not all the organisms are killed. causing it to curdle.,but there isn't much chance for those few bacteria left behind to multiply and do much damage..If left out..still won't kill, will the bacteria build up create some mold or something from other bacteria? great show btw",0.804,144

"Honest question, not judging, is Adam (or more accurately the writers) federalists. What he said about these specific rules being controlled by the states is kind of what the constitution is for. States having power over the federal government is an important part of this system. That's why you see a lot of people hating on prohibition. My point is, it seemed like this video was pushing to get some kind of norm established with a national mandate. That obviously doesn't nessacarily mean federal mandate, but let's be real here, that's the most practical way for all 50 states to do regulate it anymore than it already is. I'm not ignoring the fact that this video is singing more to the tune of ""don't just throw food away. Check it and don't LET it go bad so you don't have to waste money and resources."" I, personally, just don't think thats something our federal or even state governments need to concern themselves with.
