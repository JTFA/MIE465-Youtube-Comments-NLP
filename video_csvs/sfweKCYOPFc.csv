"#1 what if you can‚Äôt finish all the noodles

#2 sauce will run down the spoon and get all over the handle of the spoon AND the handle of the pan

#3 I‚Äôm willing to bet 95% of the time you‚Äôll still have multiple tic-tacs fall out 

#4 what? IF IT WAS MADE TO CLEAN WALL PAPER WHY IS IT CALLED PLAY-DOE

#5 that‚Äôs just common sense. 

#6 ITS WRITTEN ON THE BOX

#7 the type of plunger you use makes no difference. You just have to not be an idiot and know how to use a plunger.
Also, who would want to reach up inside a ‚Äútoilet plunger‚Äù to pull the cone out. It‚Äôs all covered in dried up shit and piss water.",-0.2418,151
"#1. Now you have to commit to eating the whole thing. Whether you were intending to or not.

#2. Only works for thick sauces.

#3. That actually takes noticeably more work. You can literally see them trying to hold back the container to not spill out more. Plus, who eats just one?

#4. Doesn't matter what it was intended for, playdough is now a child's toy item for moulding things. That is how it is advertised too. So YOU are using it wrong by using it to clean walls.

#5. Eh, Don't use them so no comment.

#6. Like a bad infomercial... Just hold the lid down and pull out, not up. Works just as well.

#7. If it covers the hole, then it really doesn't matter. Probably should spend a few bucks to get a better plunger anyway.",0.1988,173
#2 is definitely wrong. Thats how you get sauce all over your hand,0.4215,15
"#2 is not only wrong, it's a BAD idea.  The hole in the handle was meant for hanging up the clean pot for storage so the pot won't get damaged like pots stored on top of each other in a cabinet. If you use the hole for holding a spoon, you risk oil/sauce dripping or running down the handle and not only making a mess but now you have to hold the oily/greasy handle to continue cooking. Plus, if the handle is too close to your heat source it could be a fire hazard. Just use a small plate or paper towel to rest your cooking utensils or just buy an actual spoon rest.",-0.3688,127
