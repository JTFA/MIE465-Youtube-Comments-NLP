"*NO SPOILERS*

This episode was stellar. The special effects, the actors, and the plot were amazing. It combines a sci-fi adventure and gives it the “Black mirror treatment”. It’s still dark, but the dark theme doesn’t overcome the other elements of the episode. It’s surprisingly has some humor, and the characters seem relaxed rather than sad and moody the whole time. I still haven’t seen the other episodes yet, but this is by far one of my favorite ones. Great way to start the season! :))",0.9531,111
"*Spoiler Alert*



But am i the only one who thought since the real Nanette at the end had snuck into Daly's apartment and ordered pizza to his apartment through her phone that if the police would to ever find out some way she'd be considered a suspect for murder (not sure if Daly died at the end or just got trapped in the game but lets say he did die) idk just a thought",-0.7845,78

"Black museum was boring af. It was just like the christmas episode but with the recurring theme of ""mind in a virtual world"" which by the way was overused in this season. Not a golden way to have it for the last episode in my opinion.
 Plus the tale of the doctor didn't catch my empathy due the way is at all due the way it was told, although there  there was the highest potential of all subplots and a theme not  yet explored by the series: the possibility of feeling the someone else's emotions and the dillema and conflicts and contradiction about it when you confront them with your own beliefs and povs.

So after Daly gets out of the water and enters the little space ship that crashed into the rocks he realises that the others are trying to escape. Why didn't he just use his remote right away (which was beamed back to him and in his possession), ""paused the game"" and shut down the update manually? Am I missing something? I get why he got stuck in the mod after the update finished and his crew escaped, but why didn't he just try to do it before? (and this has nothing to do with distraction by the pizza guy or his receiver button thingy not working, i mean after that when he is back in the game)",-0.6923,149

It just proves that instead of saying his victims were people of color, I should have said his victims are mostly people of color, or are a variety of races. The left doesn't propagate getting rid of white people, they want to take away the power of anyone who is white, which they do in the episode.  I'm not trying to make anything fit a narrative.

If they spent 45 minutes giving you a break down on warp manifolds and subspace inverters like the nerdy wet wank stain that was Star Trek Voyager then there's only 10 mins left in each episode to do anything actually exciting.

"That's one way of looking at it, but I've always treated the science in this genre like magic grounded on reality. Sure, they can make us believe that there are logical principles which rule the technology presented on screen, you can sugarcoat the fiction to make it look as believable as possible, but at the end of the day you have no way of knowing how implausible any of it is because it really doesn't exist. Maybe they introduced it poorly and broke your suspension of disbelief, and that's fair, but as I said you have to keep an open mind on these things, cause it's the writers who dictate what makes and doesn't make sense in their sci fi universe, reality is just along for the ride.",0.3919,139

The ending betrayed the rules the episode had seated in order to give a bullshit female empowering ending you are not alone.,-0.7941,23
"The ending of this episode was way too predictable, good guys win, bad guy suffers. In my opinion, the core idea of black mirror is the blurry line between good and bad, to give us that justice unserved feeling in the end, that's why black mirror is so unique compared with all those Hollywood cliche. Netflix really ruined the whole core idea behind black mirror when they took over from season 3.",-0.101,80
The ending was a bit stupid though. He's god in there yet magically lost those powers when the crew made a run for the black hole. Just end game or override the ship.,-0.5574,36

"The science in this episode was pretty sloppy (copying memories from saliva and all that nonsense), and it kinda retreaded old concepts we've already seen before, like living AIs, but I can overlook it because the plot was so damn good and all the elements blended together so well. I mean, the point was never how the technology actually works, but rather what you can do with it to create interesting situations, and in that sense this show succeeded beautifully.",0.963,90

"This episode strongly propagated a message of identity politics. The villain is a white male who enslaves his victims made up of women and people of color in a world he constructed in which he occupies a privileged position that is godlike enabling him to control and exploit them for his own pleasure while prohibiting them from any pleasure of their own including sexual pleasure. The protagonists escape only by banding together on a mission intent on destroying his system of oppression which in the end results in his implied death, while they are surprised to find they are not destroyed along with the system but have entered a new world of endless possibilities without boundaries or rules or white male overlords. The oppressed minorities that make up the proletariat have overthrown the white male bourgeoisie and are free to create their utopia now that they are all equal partners in control of their own ship. Any observations made about the abuse of technology in this episode would only be superficial. This was nothing other than social justice porn.",0.4963,186

But isn't that an exception that proves the rule? Then there's the receptionist who was made into another color. I don't think that the writers consciously decided to do this with the story. It's so deeply ingrained in their minds that it just came out that way. It's how they see the world.",-0.8934,96

"You are correct, stealing other people's DNA could be considered morally wrong but it is still completely legal. There is nothing stopping you from collecting DNA from things that other people have thrown away. Aside from that, we only sympathise with the AI because that's how the narrative was designed. But realistically, I have murdered literally millions of people in video games, many while begging for their lives and expressing emotion. However it's not real, they are just programs designed to emulate life. Code is not life as it does not have a soul. Narratively he is the villain but in real life, he wasn't any different from the average Joe or Jane.",-0.9266,126

Your current perceptions are warped here to try to fit this into a narrative mate.
