"'Annihilation' is probably my most anticipated film of 2018. So finding out I would not be able to watch it on the big screen - living in Denmark - I was pretty bummed.

(24:20) Danny Boyle's Trance was great! Highly recommended for those who like non-linear storytelling - and loved both Rosario Dawson and James McAvoy.  Boyle will bring some edge to the next Bond film.,0.9167,38
(Canadian here) Don't make fun of the way we talk. Few people do it right. Cloverfield paradox was in no way a bad movie. Loved it. watch it multiple times. Bright was a fun take on a buddy cop movie i didn't have to pay money to see. Bladerunner 2049 was unbelievably good but I'm old and love the original Bladerunner that critics hated. Last Jedi I have mixed feelings over. DCEU is conceptually great but little things make it hard to like. Fringe was great. Danny Boyle is over and if he does a Bond prepare for a Ewan McBond.,0.9432,114

And Paramount is right - people will be leaving the theater in total WTF?! state.

"Disagree completely with the panel on Annihilation, Paramount desperately needs to avoid additional large losses and focus on potential hits like Mission Impossible this year in order to be around in the future to make movies and keep thousands employed. The general audience is not aware or care of international releases or its distribution so the Netflix deal won't be a factor for domestic box office. The director of this film is probably happy with Paramount as the film will see a domestic theatre release, potentially have more people see it because of Netflix, and most likely make more money through backend points because of the profitability chance afforded through the Netflix distribution purchase. The niche group outside of the US and Canada that cares about seeing it in a theatre experience can organize a one night showing at a theatre if desired.",0.3964,150

Maybe what theaters should do is instead of rating movies on violence, sex, and so froth (because these barriers between movie ratings are becoming severely overlapped... lets just get to the core idea behind the film... are you here for eye candy... rating DA[Dumb Ass]... a little thinking and eye candy... rating WDA[Working Dumb Ass]... I want a movie to immerse in a world that is logical in its own right... rating NDA[Not a Dumb Ass]... and titties... rating BAT[Big Ass Titties].",-0.9514,183

"The major Hollywood Studios all hold several separate screenings for critical review by ""media critics"". The Studios generally use the leading industry market research and polling to run the early screenings, so the studios would get the widest possible audience results.  ""Test screenings are most often used to finalize the ""theatrical cut"" and sometimes don't have all the 'adr', sound effects, score or music, even sometimes missing visual effects and last minute ""reshoots"". The Studios do it that way to maintain control over the finished film and make corrections.",-0.6808,106

Arrival is not a high concept film.",0.8356,63
"There aren't any specific ""regulations"" stopping theaters from showing *any* suitable movie on a screen for a few. But there are several massive hurdles that keep some movies from being available in the proper format to be screened in any of the major chain movie theaters. The first one is that a film has to be in either the correct digital encoding to be shown through a digital movie projector or a fully tracked commercial finished ""print"", both of which are usually in any films ""production budget"". And nearly every film in a major movie theater chain is delivered through a studio or independent distributor, which get the ""booking fees"" and advanced license fees on behalf of the film makers and studios (the actual license holders). Then the other issues of screens already being ""sold"" and ""booked"" for the major blockbuster movies and pricing for service comes into play.  The majority of all movie theaters *can* rent out whole showings of a movie, even at a small discount, if given enough time. Most movie theaters *do* rent out their auditoriums for conferences and non movie purposes.  But theaters have almost no way of showing any film that isn't in some form of current release, or was never formatted for a ""theatrical release"" (like a movie that was made for streaming or direct to video (DVD or Blue Ray) release.   It's a completely stupid part of how movies are handled in these modern times when it could all be handled digitally.  I guess that most movie theaters don't see a way to capture enough sales for showing special features screenings and don't want to find ways to share the added expense of ""mastering"" a full catalogue of content to show to audiences, in an ""on demand"" type of screening system.  But it could become a ""thing"" if any of the production companies/studios/distributors/exhibitors were willing to make the investment and work out royalties.",0.646,375

"This news made me so angry. Whilst I appreciate the position Netflix is in to commission interesting and thought provoking projects without the constraints of box office potentials etc., it still net to remember its place: ON FUCKING TELEVISION. Cinemas and the theatrical experience will NEVER be replaced by streaming services, it creates an experience and atmosphere that the best Samsung TV or Apple laptop or Bose sound system will never be able to replace. Does no one else see how incredibly depressing and anticlimactic it is to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a movie, have some of the most creatively talented people in the world spend months, sometimes years crafting the screenplay, set design, art direction, cinematography, visual effects to perfection only to have it just uploaded onto so website once its done so people can just watch it whenever they feel like it?

There's a constant weighing of benefits going on when deciding how/when to view a film in 2018, and as other commenters have said, most people whose jobs have nothing to do with the industry value having that flexibility with watching a movie. But, I see both sides.

"wouldn't it be a good strategy for Producers and studios, for movies that have a decent critical acclaim potential -- say to test it for critics, or choose your test audience properly-- to dump it straight to Netflix soon after the movie releases. Netflix (or other streaming services') money can replace DVD sales money, and Netflix has an audience that is a) either intrigued by word-of-mouth publicity that the movie generates but couldn't watch it on the big screen; or b) loved the movie and want to watch it a second (or third time). You still do end up spending the money on marketing but maybe that can be split in the middle between studios and streaming platforms, considering you allow the movie to go live on streaming platforms 3-4 weeks after its theatrical release, when its still fresh on the minds of people, but not in the movie screens anymore.",0.8315,171
