Incidentally, if you’re a fan (in UK) and didn’t catch her on BBC Radio 2 yesterday, I’d recommend you fish it out on iPlayer within the next 29 days. There’s a Fleetwood Mac cover but this time it’s a Stevie song – yay. There’s a song from the forthcoming album and a slowed down piano version of one of the old favourites. The Lissie session begins about 1hr 9mins into the Jo Whiley show (6 Feb 2018). Enjoy.",0.9208,118

"Midnight, knocking on my window
Light playing tricks on me
Oh, I’m running out of time
Wasted so many hours
Gave up all of my power and for what?
It’s like I’ve been out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I won’t give up
I won’t give up

[Chorus]
I want a love that's made of blood and muscle
I want a love that's brave, can take my tears
I wanna laugh at the dark like I’m not scared of nothing
I wanna love that's made of blood and muscle

[Post-Chorus]
Blood and muscle, muscle
Blood and muscle, muscle
Blood and muscle, muscle

[Verse 2]
The crows fly higher and higher
Their cries sound like a choir in the sky
It’s like they’re taunting me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Saying you should give up
But I won’t give up

I want a love that's made of blood and muscle
I want a love that's brave, can take my tears
I wanna laugh at the dark like I’m not scared of nothing
I wanna love that's made of blood and muscle

[Bridge]
Real and warm and alive
And not just in my mind

I want a love that's brave, can take my tears
I wanna laugh at the dark like I’m not scared of nothing
I want a love that's made of blood and muscle, muscle

I know that she's gained many fans throughout these past 6 years that I've been following her career and I wish her so much continued success.

I played Blood & Muscle for the first time, and admit I was a bit indifferent. Played it a second time, and WOW, this has so much more in it I discovered on the second play; the passion, power and range of her voice, the deep bass of the piano the background harmonies... this is so good.

This sits well against 'Boyfriend', another recent great track.  Love the look on the video too.",0.9879,122
