"You said about comfort, if I can ride a steel road bike for 6 hours, then it's a non issue. I would suggest trying out a steel tourer, drop bars, 700x28 tyres, steel fork, with a relaxed  (not road race) geometry. If you sit vertically you aren't aerodynamic, which slows you down, wears you out more. Doesn't mean you need to ride a TT bike. Something like Dawes Super Galaxy, try that.",0.875,88
"You're not paying for the craftsmanship either, a mil or two is a borderline tolerance when building a barn - it's certainly not precise enough for a vehicle (if you're counting a bicycle as a vehicle). 
So they're overgrown hippies who're selling crappy, crude steel tubing to ignorant hipster-lifeforms. At the end, you're eventually paying truly physical and valuable aspects of this ""product"" - such as makers soul, passion and dedication...",0.4939,82
"You've got it backwards Joey. Â The big manufacturers are the ones with the marketing budgets. Â Why a custom hand-built bike? Â There are many tradeoffs involved in the dimensions, geometry, choice of tubing thickness, diameters, etc... Â These affect handling, responsiveness, damping, etc... Â How the bicycle ""feels"". Â  A factory bike will have a decent compromise of these. Â A custom bike will be exactly suited to your physical dimensions and your personal tastes.

"biggest benefit is that you can get the sizing just right. For many people, the geometry of standard sizes doesn't work well for them. I have for instance rather short arms and long legs have difficulty with reach on a standard road bike. I can swap out the stem for a shorter one, but that isn't 100 % perfect. A custom bike would allow me to get the handlebars closer and be more comfortable on a road bike. If I ever get rich somehow, I'll definitely buy a custom frame that fits my body like a tailor made suit.",0.9421,108

Im not going to say anything negative about this guys handmade steel frames- they do look really nice,  but virtually ALL carbon bikes in this price range come with much nicer components, and yes will be lighter.  Plus, if someone wants to spend that kind of money or more on a bike that will ""last a lifetime"" BUY A TITANIUM BICYCLE.
