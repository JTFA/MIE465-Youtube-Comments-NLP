"I can't believe she chose that song for an audition....the choice alone would have made me, if I were a judge, see saw about pushing my button thinking we would be fighting over song selection that's going to get her a win. Voice judges can get wrapped up into thinking strategy of where does this voice fit she's lucky it is early in the auditions if their teams had been nearly full she might not have got a turn. They should start each year with the late contestants from the previous year singing a new song that did not get a chair turn.",0.6808,110

I'm sorry but... I kept comparing her to Janice from last season thinking I preferred Janice.
