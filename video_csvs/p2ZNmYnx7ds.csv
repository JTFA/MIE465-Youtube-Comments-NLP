This is a magic charm from Babylon (Satan's prostitute) to keep you sleep and drunk. Wake up and stay sober or you will wake up in Hell. ""You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate.

"in my little opinion. ortega will not go beyond holloway. this is where the buck stops for ortega, i wish i didnt have to say this but his ideals are what prevents him from going further than the height he has climbed so far. mark me words lads. i do see a good fraction of authenticity but for some reason it feels he sacrifices authenticity for conformity. that is never a good thing for a figther. If u look at conor mcgregor the degree to which he conforms is only to further his own purpose whereas with ortega, the degree he conforms to in terms of fan tolerance/acceptance/appeal does not further his own end in the octagon. In the cage you need to be as authentic as possible and to compromise any part of it will have an impact on your perfermance. it is my little theory i will wager on if anyone is interested. holloway will beat this man.",0.9545,176
