"+Louise Austin Well, to my mind, an autistic person should not have guns.  Nor should any teen with a history of suicidal depression.  A boy who attacks his mother violently should not have a gun.  A kid with ADHD - an impulse control disorder - should not have a gun.  A kid who brings a knife to school... again, RED FLAG!  

None of those a tiny little hints.  That's not smoke... it's a raging fire.  

By contrast, I suggest watching the TED Talk given by one of the mothers of one of the Columbine shooters.  She's obviously unwell and can't quite connect herself to what happened but she is trying.

These two people give me the creeps with their ""it's not our job"" attitude towards this young man.  I've heard people talking about how they took in a stray cat in more caring tones.

I'm not saying everyone should be capable of helping a special needs, traumatized person of any age... but if you choose to do it, then you have to be all in.  

Was it really asking too much for these people to let him move in and refuse to allow the guns?  Or, to ensure the guns were locked in a box that they owned and controlled and again... housed elsewhere?

I'd think more of them if they didn't distance themselves from him right now.  Seems to me that a whole long list of adults failed this kid.  ""It takes a village.""",0.5522,278

George Washington wanted every town to have its own weapons and ammunition manufacturing plant to maintain its political and military integrity as a community. Thomas Jefferson wanted everyone to be required to have a gun.

If those things had happened there would be less crime and less shootings because communities would be more defined and self-sustaining and anybody who tried to shoot other people without cause would be quickly incapacitated by being shot - if they weren't deterred in the first place.

And under that right is a subordinate right to have more than just your fists to do it - to use tools for self-defense, especially women, who have equal rights and dignity, but not equal physical strength. It just so happens that firearms are the most effective and the most widely possessed self-defense tool.

"Sam Yan The AR-15 IS the civilian version. No one uses closed-bolt, magazine-fed, shoulder-fired weapons in assaults unless they have to, so not even the full-auto or 3-round burst M16s are really ""assault rifles."" The preferable weapon for an assault is the SAW(Squad Automatic Weapon), or the larger M240B, open-bolt, BELT-fed, bipod-mounted, and can fire continuously for a minute or more. If you can't lay down continuous fire in an assault, then you can't gain fire-superiority and have no chance of succeeding, so an assault is pointless.

I tend to think ""assault rifle"" came from a video game that was trying to sound cool, though. I am not confident it is a real term.",-0.9884,142

"Whether someone is of legal age to own guns or not is irrelevant to whether he should be allowed to own any if there have been signs of serious mental illness... with or without the current appalling lack of laws effectively addressing this crisis, hosts must take proactive responsibility in who/what they allow into their home, & continue to monitor the behavior of guests--especially those they don't know well or who come from a troubled background.  Even if this couple didn't know most of this young man's extremely turbulent history (for which one can feel great compassion), to take in an almost complete stranger when you know that a) his mother just died, b) by his own admission he's depressed (for whatever reasons, which you obviously couldn't know the full extent of), c) he owns guns incl. at least 1 semi-automatic, & d) you haven't bothered to check further into this individual's history & still allow him/his guns to take up residence in your home at all constitutes naivete & foolishness in the extreme.  These homeowners reportedly even let this young guest take initial possession of the gun safe key/s & give THEM one--??  Furthermore, a quick search on the Net will uncover that gun safes are notoriously easy to break into, even if their guest hadn't had his own key.  ●While there is much to be applauded in this couple's big hearts shown by taking in this young man at a time of personal crisis, helping him find a job, arranging mental health therapy, etc., the reality is that by providing him w/a ""safe haven"" w/out taking prudent precautions & doing their ""due diligence"" via even a cursory check re: the above concerns w/at least a basic Internet security background search service, the high school this kid had attended (same one he shot up) & the local PD to see if there had been any prior issues, they missed an otherwise life-saving opportunity to uncover a much different picture than what they thought they were looking at.  They are extremely fortunate that this young guest didn't first torture their multiple pets (at least, as far as they know) or turn his guns on themselves before their son's school (as in the Sandy Hook & a number of other school shooting episodes).  ●My spouse & I have taken in a number of different troubled or in-crisis individuals over the decades (& have also been deceived)--& sad to say most have turned around & kicked us in the teeth.  We understand that this behavior pattern was established long before their stay w/us & may not have been our fault--but it has still provided us loads of heartbreak.  The most notable exception to this was the young lady from an extremely difficult background (no fault of her own) who eventually became our daughter & has more than made up for all the rest.  However, the reality is that w/the weight of experience we would likely do more pre-checking out of a proposed even overnight guest previously unknown to us, & put stricter limits on/terminate their stay much sooner at ""red flag"" signs of serious disrespect or danger.  ●It also bears questioning here why well before the 39th(?!) call to this young man's former home by police he wasn't evaluated & placed in some kind of secure residential treatment program--w/zero access to guns??  And why noone amongst the evidently over 200 followers on his Instagram account w/many threatening images/comments didn't report him?  Not to speak of Congress/the Pres. time & again defeating commonsense gun purchase background checks & mental health-related legislation... seems to me that sadly in addition to much background tragedy in this young man's life, there's a great deal of blame to go around here in how society at large/his local community specifically dealt w/those challenges--which compounded to create this ""perfect storm"" of epic proportions.",-0.9627,752

SOMETHING NOT RIGHT  ABOUT THE SNEADS
I am attaching the FBI transcript of the tip received by the FBI in 
January 2018, which gives the name, location, propensities of Cruz, 
tells of Cruz' threats to shoot up a school; and talks about his arsenal 
of guns.
I find this FBI transcript important insofar as what it tells us about 
the Sneads.  
This girl who is calling may very well be from the  Deschamp family.  
The Deschamp family is the friend of the mother who was the Executrix of 
the mother's will.  Cruz went to live with this family when the mother 
died in Nov. 1, 2017.  He may have even lived there before his mother 
died (while she was sick.  The mother  had died of pneumonia).

 He lived with the Deschampsat least from Nov. 1  until around 
Thanksgiving 2017 when he moved into the Snead's house.  From the 
caller's description, it appears that this girl who called the FBI was 
very close to Cruz and considered him like a ""brother.""  

I have caught the Sneads in several lies during their interviews and I 
will not go into that now, but the lies were significant..  In one of 
their interviews it appeared as if they were being interviewed in their 
own living room, for the room looked like someone's living room, and it 
would be reasonable to infer that it was the Snead's living room.  The 
room was beautifully appointed.  But I looked up the Snead's address on 
google earth, and it is a dump, and not only a dump, but one that is 
very hidden behind tall fences.  I looked up the people who lived there 
and I could find none that were around Cruz' age.  Everyone living in 
the house was in their forties.  Mr. Snead is a ""highly decorated 
army veteran who worked as a military intelligence analyst"".  He is in his forties.  What does he do now?  
In any event, the Sneads  said that the Snead boy met Cruz while in 
JROTC.  Snead's son, the media tells us, was a junior in the Stoneman 
Douglas  high school, which means he was around 16.  Cruz was 19 years 
old.  That is a large difference in age and I find their friendship  and 
his invitation to live in the Snead home to be odd, because of the 
difference in age.. But the girl who called the FBI told a different 
story about how they met.

In any event, the caller to the FBI (who is probably someone from the  Deschamp 
family)   said that Cruz met the Snead boy (who the caller calls a 
""young boy"") on Instagram.    In other words, according to the girl 
caller, Cruz did not really know this boy, except through the internet.  
 Yet, the Sneads invited Cruz to live in their house?  So, in effect, 
they took a perfect stranger to them as well as to their son into their 
home?  They, themselves, said they did not know what everyone else in 
the school knew about Cruz, but they should have known, had they called 
the family friend who Cruz lived with before he lived with Snead.    .

They Sneads say they knew nothing about Cruz, and that he did not have 
any of the traits described by everyone else.  I found it odd at the time that the 
Sneads, who did not know him, and did not want to find out anything about him, 
 would take him into their home, and never call  the family he 
was living with, who was very close friends with Cruz' mother - the Deschamps. The Deschamps  
acted as his guardian.  Yet, Snead never thought he should call them 
when he took Cruz into their home???  I thought it was odd BEFORE I read 
the FBI transcript attached.  Now, I believe it is stranger still for 
the below reasons. 

This caller to the FBI said that the family (Deschamp) tried to call Mr. 
Snead countless times, and Cruz' s aunt ALSO tried to call, and the caller to 
the FBI  ALSO tried to call Mr. Snead, and that Snead never returned these 
calls, even though they left messages and were concerned about Cruz.  

The caller then said

  , ""....if you're going to help somebody and you know there's family 
involved, at least return the phone calls and talk to them about it.  
Or, you know, return the phone call and say mind your own business.  
Yeah, something.""  

  In other words, this caller, who is obviously a young girl, thought it 
was very odd that Mr. Snead never returned the calls of Cruz' family members 
who very obviously cared about  him and were worried about him.  Why 
wouldn't Snead return their calls?",0.9705,900
