Trust, rest and find peace in this love!

So friends, repent and come to Him today! You will be saved! You will be delivered from your sins and from the judgement headed to this earth. Jesus made a Way to escape it by taking our punishment upon Himself! Thank You, Jesus!

You don't need a fancy prayer or a lot of faith to do this. All you need is faith as big as a mustard seed, and words that are from your heart. It is simple. 

I pray you make Jesus your Lord and Savior today by calling upon Him. You will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

"rau1n actually all the music she produced about being a party girl and all that stuff was pushed onto her by her abusive producer she signed a contract that forced her to portray that image because that was what sold records at that time, if you check out her newest music that she's making without him it's a complete change and her vocals are amazing",-0.1779,67
"rau1n i'd like links to all these videos because I've never heard of any of that, and I'm not saying she's a saint I'm just saying her music has lightened up a lot more and people should give it a try, no need to get so angry about all this stuff music and entertainment is for fun and enjoyment, also kesha was a songwriter for years before she became a musician herself she's credited for writing a lot of the top music over the years",0.8426,89
