Furthermore, by reducing public access to birth control, and considering it in relation to the racial difference in the use of the service. Trump, could very well be trying to increase white birth rates, as well as reduce minority birth rates!

"In a civilised world a mother gets a paid maternity leave 6-8 weeks before the expected date of birth to stay home. 60% of women spends last 1-2 week in a hospital ""to be on the safe side"". After the birth she stays in hospital for an extra 3-5 days (longer when necessary). Everything is covered from the the single payer health insurance. After she returns back home the mother is granted  60% of her previous income for three years (in total) and it's up to her for how long she decides to stay with the baby and what will be the monthly check. The employer must not fire her during the pregnancy or the maternity leave (he doesn't pay her though the money goes from social insurance program). Our infant mortality is one of the lowest in OECD, and frankly the death of a woman giving birth is virtually nonexistent (0.0002 last year).

Public healthcare has been shown for over 60 years to improve the economy by keeping the population healthy to work and function in society...but there is no arguing with people who are irrational. Believing 'free markets' solve any public or moral issue is like believing in Santa Claus - it is just wishful and wrong.  Setting the value of human life based on a market, like a object would also be wrong in every religion - so the Republican ""Christian"" should try opening a bible to see your god values life, not money. The USA is obsessed with money and trying to capitalize everything. Free markets have nothing to do with caring for people. America is doomed by their ignorance and hate.",0.1779,190

india is even worse so nice lies. Oh and heres a nice fact take in that most women spit out babies as fast as possible for welfare and then they dont pay the hospitals for maturnal care thats the reason they close and thats the reason yall are called libtards who are trying to destroy our statues which are only offensive to snowflakes.
