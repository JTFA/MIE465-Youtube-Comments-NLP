Plus, no one seen what they were writing/wrote or how it was placed into the canister, or what was in the canister, just what they tell you, and no one was allowed to question it, or open each result there after, they just said the canister was empty. Also, all it takes is for a magician to give the one drawing from a canister a few lessons on how to win who they want, that could also happen, and wearing long sleves etc. can also help acheive just that.

CNN the headline did catch my attention but please add some narrative to address my questions & explain why this was big news to you.  At this point, I'm disappointed it wasn't a gun draw between the candidates. They could have held fake flag pistols & the one who released it 1st be declared the winner!  Then release confetti, music & idiots screaming & jumping up & down.  This was just sad.",-0.5667,129
"Unless something has changed, my understanding was it was the DEMOCRAT that reached out to the Republican and said ""hey look, no matter what lets accept the decision of this draw and not demand a recount"" and the Republican shot her down.
