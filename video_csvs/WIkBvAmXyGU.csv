Sure, CMBYN is a great film but there are some power houses out there and major actors fying for the same thing. It's just not going to happen and the Golden Globes proves my point.

The same will happen at the Oscars, although Lady Bird has a huge potential in winning Best Picture, given it’s Gerwig’s directorial debut and what a stunning debut it is! But then again, I feel like there’s a certain pattern the academy follows, as in this year they’ll go for a big budget movie or one that has powerhouse names in it (Argo, Spotlight), then the next year they’ll choose an indie one or one that sheds light on slightly more controversial topics/marginalized communities (13 Years Of Slaves, Moonlight).",0.9701,131
