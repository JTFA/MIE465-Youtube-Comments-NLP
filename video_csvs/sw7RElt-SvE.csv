"+Andrew Ryan I mean I love Marvel too, but I'm not a ""fanboy"" I'm a fan. I won't go around to other trailers and shout ""Infinity War!"" when the trailer has nothing to dp with Infinity War.",-0.6793,46
"+Gazzer GT Buddy, I can guarantee you that DC fans are worse. They will do whatever it takes to bash Marvel or anyone who has a differing opinion about their movies. Yeah, there are a lot of Marvel fans but you rarely see them and they rarely are everywhere parading the Marvel name. DC fans on the other hand, will do whatever it takes to make their name known.",0.9147,77
"+Gazzer GT No, from my experience. DC fans are way worse. They are the equivalent of man childs who don't want to take any criticism about the DCEU and will insult Marvel (and you) for absolutely no reason. Even if the conversation is about the DCEU can improve and by taking some of the steps Marvel took they still will be completely babies and take that as an insult. Heck, there are even DC fans in this comment section asking for a director's cut of Justice League.",-0.597,97
+Geralt of Rivia A comment sounds either way on the internet. It's hard to comprehend what tone you are going for or what you are truly trying to say depending on your statement. I assumed that you were one of those people who didn't care whether or not a film like Paddington did well or not because your statement made it seem that way. You didn't make it sound like you did care anyway. Maybe if you made what you were saying more clearer it would have helped more.,-0.5962,95
+Geralt of Rivia It's all about making what your saying as clear as possible for others to understand.,0.3818,20
"+Geralt of Rivia My  ""paragraph"" really isn't even that long. It's almost about as long as your comment. Also, with most comments I am able to comprehend the point they are trying to make. Your comment is arguably kind of vague in what you are saying, especially when it came to the topic of conversation. You didn't really make it clear whether you were trying to insult the movie or just state a would be fact. I took it as an insult because you phrased it as if it were an insult. I'm trying to defend the movie by saying it has as much effort put in as something like Infinity War and then you say the will ""Fade from existence"". That more sounds like it's going against the movie rather than for it, regardless whether or not you didn't mean it that way. If you said ""The movie will likely fade from existence, but I don't want it to"" then I would have been able to comprehend what side you were really coming from.",-0.6706,195
"+Geralt of Rivia Says who? You? A movie Infinity War is going to blow any other small film like Paddington away. However, we shouldn't neglect films like Paddington that, while not as big in scale or anticipation, still have as much care and effort put into them as any other blockbuster like Infinity War.",0.8418,62

I mean I understand it’s a real person movie not an animated movie but cmon put more actions than like only 5-6 in a movie. Look at Justice League and Wonder Woman. They are much more fun to watch since theres more action!,0.9515,121
