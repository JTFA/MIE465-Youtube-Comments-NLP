"Gary McCaffrey You did a good job summarizing everything. The only thing I will add is I agree with your observations about Alex’s birth mother who was raised in an orphanage herself. And seems to have had a very hard life. When I watched their meeting again I was able to concentrate on little things I hadn’t noticed the first time. She was very reserved and almost sad. Yet you could see there was love there and sadness when she told Alex goodbye.
I think the contrast in Alex’s and his father meeting only shined a light on the difference in the birth mom and birth fathers reactions. Lastly, I will speculate that Alex’s dad was thrilled finding out he had a son at the age of 44. Yes, we see Alex’s half sister but having a son is a matter of pride no doubt.",0.2732,166

"Hi Max, we have a translator with us most times :)",0.507,12
Hi Rene! There are several videos on my channel. A longer version + some extra clips that this was from :),0.5093,23
"His birth mother grew up in an orphanage, adoption and children's homes were totally normal to her, so giving up a child she couldn't care for was totally normal. When she was 18 she had a one off 'romance' with the birth father, they were never in a relationship. The birth father was in the Army at the time they met, but he just moved on with his life and had no contact with birth mother and no knowledge that a child existed.

Alex found someone in Russia; I believe through social media, who could help him track down his birth mother, his birth mother gave him the name of his birth father, and Alex was then able to find his birth father.

Alex went to Russia to visit his birth parents, first his birth mother, who seemed unsure of how to deal with his visit. She seemed to have lived a harder, very different life to his birth father. It was an odd meeting, but interesting to watch, his birth mother didn't come across as very affectionate or interested, but I got the feeling that's just part of her character, and part of having had a difficult life growing up in orphanages, perhaps affection isn't something that's very normal to her, as I don't think she herself ever had active parents.

His birth father, as you can see, was very different, he was overjoyed to learn of his existence, and to meet and greet him. Whenever Alex mentioned his birth mother to his birth father, his birth father just asked how she was doing, maybe out of politeness, but it appeared clear she wasn't someone he was really interested in talking about, perhaps amplified by the fact that he was now with his wife and new baby girl, Alex's new half sister. 

I have nothing much better to do than summarise this for you. :D",0.9872,354
