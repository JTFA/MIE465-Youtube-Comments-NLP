"Agreed. I don't doubt he's been a perv but using this as an example is stretching it. There's a delay from when it's sent and when he's heard it and he just happened to make this face. It's why they used it for this segment on Conan. Now people are using it as an example, but it's taken a little out of context. All this ish is turning into a witch hunt and it's a shame because it's not good for those who have experienced serious bs. People just seem to be stretching for examples here.",-0.9153,104

"Creepy ?? Any older guy talking to a young, cute flirty girl would respond in similar way. Older women do it to younger men as well. As of Conan, have you seen him interview good looking actresses??? He practically leaps out of his chair 😬 I’m just amazed at what a which hunt this has become nationally and how quick the media is to throw them under a bus without facts. Guilty until proven innocent I guess.",0.9476,89
