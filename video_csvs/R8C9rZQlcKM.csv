"Fantastic work ONCE again, Your trying something new.. What do you think of this collection of shots ?. Do you think personally they show what you would have hoped ?. I love color but i also know in B/W you get the most out of ANY Photo because of the detail you can receive from it. 

Let the community know when your back to streaming, I haven't really been on those storm networks since, because i do not know when session's begin anymore...

Glad to see your still at it though.

Thank you for your time and the video.",0.9233,111
