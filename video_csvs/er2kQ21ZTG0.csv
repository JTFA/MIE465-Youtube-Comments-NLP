"I just got home from thrift shopping on 23rd Street.  I like to check out Goodwill. Also City Opera Thrift is a few doors down to the east and the Salvation Army thrift store (which is the cheapest, but has no dressing rooms) is a few doors down to the west. And across 3rd Ave is Vintage Thrift which is a bit more expensive, but has great stuff. And across 23rd is Housing Works thrift.  I think this area is the best in the city for thrift shops. I've bought coats, tops, pants, sweaters, etc. in one or the other. Today I got a great navy beret.",0.9735,124
