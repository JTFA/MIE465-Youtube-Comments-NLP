"*As a saints fan I gotta say the Marshawn run was one of the worst times being in ""Who Dat"" nation*",-0.4215,25
All he had to do was come up to Diggs as he was there in plenty of time and wait for him to come down with the ball and just bear hug him and keep him in bounds for a couple of seconds and it's over.  Crowley would have been there to assist on the tackle and the Saints would be taking on the Eagles this week.  What the hell he was doing I have no idea.  I have never seen that before where a defender looks down and away before contact and misses that badly.  Makes you think someone had a bet on the game because the Vikings didn't cover the spread on the betting line.,-0.8074,122

You don't get paid millions to miss on a fundamental play, something we as football players get taught from day 1. I feel bad for him but let's be real he said ""when that situation comes again."" They might not get that chance again, that's why it's important to seize the moment, you can't take opportunities like that for granted and think they'll be in that position again. Either way congrats to both teams on a great game",0.9011,119

"I have looked at that play many many times. The angle at which the offensive player caught it (the speed, momentum, way he came down) he was on his way out of bounds. Even if the defender was to come in to make a good tackle, there is a high chance they would have gone out of bounds. Resulting in 1-2 seconds and a field goal to end the game either way.",0.5719,81
I hope Marcus keeps his head up and why should anyone be mad at him because three out the season he‚Äôs one the main reasons the saints had success to he playoffs that‚Äôs how good he was and when he got an interception and of that didn‚Äôt happen the Vikings could have easily one win that interception he gave the team confidence to comeback he just timed the tackle a little early he‚Äôs a rookie and he‚Äôs new he won‚Äôt let that happen again n war equal be better than ever and the saints could possibly win the Super bowl,0.9702,112

You need to feel terrible for taking millions and not being able to make that simple tackle, my 8 year old could've done better, maybe not taken him down but at least wrapped up on him. I've been an athlete in my youth, if I failed my team I apologized to them and the fans and easily could've explained why it happened, he just kept repeating bs about making a play and being a hero but you didn't do that so why is the question, he's rambling and not answering, that's not good enough for me.",0.8743,181
I sorta feel bad for this guy.,-0.4976,8
I think it'll be easier for him to recover from this because he still doesn't realize what a boneheaded thing he did. He thinks that the guy just made a play at the same time he was trying to make a play. He said himself right there that he was going for the pass breakup. It never crossed his mind that conceding the reception was meaningless so long as he made the tackle.,0.5719,77

I was in Winn-Dixie last week and the entire store was jumping for joy and high five'n &hugging each other screaming ""We did it, We won"".....then 1min later u hear ""What, OMG WHAT???....Noooooooooooooo OMG what the hell happened, OMG NOOOOOOOO, damn it, nooooooooooo""!!!!...Then someone clarifies that Williams missed the ball and fell over
 (very suspiciously) while Diggs from the Vikings is running full speed to the in zone!!! I'm like ""Yessssssss, OMG, Yesss""!!!!!
What's sad about saints fans and football fans in general is that some people take this shit so seriously. I literally heard a man while I was in Winn-Dixie Dixie say he was going to slut his wrists when he gets home. Now I'm sure he was kidding or at least I hope he was kidding but still it's not that serious. People's entire week was ruined cuz the saints lost. It's a game people!!!! And majority of these football players don't give a shit about their fans. Of course they might give you an autograph at a football game or something but try asking for an autograph or picture outside of the arena etc. If u see one of these football players out at a restaurant I can almost guarantee u wouldn't get a pic or anything. U probably wouldn't even make it close enough to ask them cuz their security would shewww u away. I witnessed this first hand at Home Depot. There was a saints player at Home Depot with another guy and this kid probably 12 yrs old went up to him and asked if he would sign his hat 
(His SAINTS hat).....and I couldn't believe it, he told the kids in these exact words ""I'm busy today, I gotta run"" .....damn shame",-0.9863,400

Is this the guy that tackled his teammate to lose the game? Probably laughing his way to the bank after getting paid off for that one.,0.128,28
"It has been weeks since Williams blew the game for the Saints. I think he was paid to tackle his own teammate instead of making the easy tackle to end the game and move onto the next phase of the playoffs. Because I live in New Orleans and the Saints are part of our culture I will still root for them, but with a pinch of salt, knowing that the NFL is just as corrupt as, well, everything else in the modern world.",0.5574,90
