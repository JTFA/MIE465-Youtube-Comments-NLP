I agree he is a pop artist, but I also believe that he has put out R&B records, as well as dance music, and pretty much every style he chooses to explore.

"NicoSlash2011 Nope, imo your 'point' = a false equivalency. A person commenting on chart music/artists ‚â† a person misbehaving in a place of worship. How is commenting that JT looks haggard even remotely the same as shouting in the middle of a religious service? ""You just got to think a little into it, not so hard"" WOW... really? Here's a critical thinking reality check question for you... you do realise this is the youtube open comments section of Beats 1 Radio, and not the Al-Aqsa mosque/St. Peter's Basilica/the Western wall... right?

Don't like me referring to Bey's similar age, consistent work ethic re albums/tours, the fact that she's raising 3 children, and the fact that imo she looks better without makeup than JT (a man hiding behind a contoured beard who gets to pass his wrinkles off as 'rugged')? That's fine... they're still facts, and you'll just have to deal with it. Don't like the fact that I mentioned that most East Asian celebs in their 30s+ have great complexions in comparison to JT... again, you'll just have to deal with it. I comment however I like based on facts, and I don't need your 'permission' to do so.

Are you defensive b/c you have the same dehydration/TEWL problems as JT, sis? Your 'problematic fave' can easily spend his 'Wonder Wheel coin' on various derma treatments/well-formulated products/prescription retinol/sunscreen. Regular people on the street can buy affordable retinol/exfoliators from brands like The Ordinary, products with Niacinamide/Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid, and well-formulated sunscreens from Biore. Pharrell (44) looks great + has been a vocal supporter of exfoliating, and I'm sure Chrissy Teigen shares her skincare secrets with John Legend (who looks great for 39).

It really ain't that hard for your haggard fave to avoid prolonged sun exposure (avoiding alcohol/drugs helps too), and implement the most basic af products into his cleansing regimen. You just got to think a little into it, not so hard, and if your own haggard skin problems persist... see a dermatologist!",0.9713,419

He‚Äôs correct, it‚Äôs not his job to let the public know about the conversation with Janet afterwards to make ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù However, the same way she had to publicly apologize to America, he should‚Äôve publicly had her back like a true friend should have, he didn‚Äôt and for that, he will always be a douchebag, backstabbing son of a bitch (sipping tea)!

The fact TimberFAKE even accepted the offer (with Janet being banned, NFL says otherwise, yeah whatever...) says a lot about him! See, this is what happens when someone who was once hot and now has disappointing sales from his new song. He must need the black people's (a culture he's been benefiting off ever since his solo career) forgiveness by making us believe that conversation even happened, lol.
