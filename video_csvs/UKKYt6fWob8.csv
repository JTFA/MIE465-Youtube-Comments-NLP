This is fact.  This is how it works.  This is how it has always worked, right into 'deep time', with exception of rate of acceleration and causational vectors - No other organism has hitherto influenced planetary dynamics to this degree, nor released any sequestered carbon.

The ice melt that is causing sea level rise is the melt of ice FROM LAND. It’s not floating in the sea. So that is like adding new ice cubes continuously. Your glass will fill up and overflow.

The melt of sea ice is a problem as well though. As they explain very clearly in the video, ice reflects nearly all incident sunlight back into space. Open ocean ABSORBS most of the incident light and warms up. So less ice area and more ocean area means more capture of the suns energy which means faster warming. It’s called a positive feedback cycle.

Plus, as the oceans warm, the water physically expands. So that also drives up sea levels.
The atmosphere has captured enough energy in the last 100 years to increase in average temperature by over 1 degree C. The oceans have captured 13 times that amount of energy in the same period.",0.9604,174

I personally think more long term. When you look at the temperature data since the last glaciation it’s clear we are on a global cooling trend. But if you only look at temperatures since the end of the little ice age until now, you find global warming (up until 2007). Climate is where YOU draw the line of two particular points in time. 3rd, you will continue to see increased snow and record cold.

The opposite is true however, media is used to placate fears and yes, even this show retains a sense of doubt or ambiguity because that is all they need to do.  Just so you know, big oil have funded these media products for decades for one good reason, to sow doubt.  The consensus was in over 2 decades ago; humans are causing climate change, and our industrial emissions are causing irreversible damage to the planet.  Private motor cars are the single greatest source of cO2 and the rise of car ownership in Asia is literally the death knell, we cannot stop them wanting or buying cars and when they do, as they are today, that is the end.  Game over.
BTW climate change was predicted back in the late 1800's, it is real and extremely dangerous if you are under 50 y.o.  Lol, are you under 50??  If so, you best figure out what you want the future to look like.  On a final note, do you know that climate change already costs us billions annually?  Are you aware that islands are already going underwater?  Are you aware that desertification is spreading rapidly, far faster than ever before?  Are you aware that the human population is also rising rapidly and that there are food shortages in many places already??

The audacity and the colossal arrogance you have to deny this Tsunami of science and evidence that stands before you! I could keep going and going and sit here all day long and provide you evidence, but at what point will you change your mind? The evidence is overwhelming. It speaks for itself. This isnt even a debate. Never was. So go ahead and sweep that inconvenient truth under the rug like you do with everything else. Ignorance can be bliss.
https://www.wired.com/2017/04/bill-nye-says-climate-change-deniers-bad-case-cognitive-dissonance/
Hopefully, you'll find a way out of your episode of Cognitive Dissonance.

And if ALL the scientists are wrong. If ALL the science is wrong. And all the data is wrong. Then you need to provide the evidence to the contrary! Where is ANY of your ""evidence""? Or should we just call it ""Alternative Facts""? 

You're right on Par with your average Fry Cook conspiracy theorist. I mean, what next? The moon landing was a hoax? Bigfoot is real? Alien Abductions are true? Santa Claus is real? The Earth is Flat? Are you an Anti-Vaxxer? Or that Cigarettes are healthy for you? What other patently absurd bullshit are you going to spread? 

Just think for a moment what you are actually saying when you deny this. If you think this is AAAALL made up, then it would be Mind Blowingly the most Monumentally EPIC Hoax of Biblical proportions(like that of Noah's Ark) of all time to somehow pull this off! Just apply Occum's Razor, ""the simplest solution is usually the correct one"". Then what is more likely? That AAAALL these scientists and science organizations got together and had some TOP SECRET meeting and left everyone else out of it, except the Leftwing politicians and ALL the evidence was tampered with or completely made up and somehow got passed the minds and noses of their peers during peer reviews and ALL the Alaskan locals are just making shit up as well as ALL fact checking organizations who got together for some ""liberal agenda"" and had a secret meeting behind closed doors to agree on 1 thing and broadcast it OR conservatives are denying this to protect their investments and/or they simply dont like change(as history shows, hence conservatism). What THE FUCK, is more likely? Just use your god damn head.

As you can clearly see, the evidence, scientific organizations, local witnesses, the data, and fact checking websites ALL align on this 1 issue. Let's not forget that these Fossil Fuel industries and Fossil Fuel invested Conservatives have MOTIVE for lying. Their money is wrapped up in this and they have too much to lose by going green! Now if ALL this is some major worldwide ""conspiracy"", then you got your work cut out for you! The amount of hoops you'd have to jump through would be insanely astronomical! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Pull your head out of your arrogant ass. People are sick of the right wing dogma.

There is no longer any debate among my colleagues! The debate is over. What we must do now is decide how we will adapt to a planet that will transition from a former mild Holocene interglacial to a rather inhospitable planet that will tip into a new climate state as the Arctic becomes ice free in the next decade or two. The implications for agriculture are enormous. Our once hospitable planet will be characterized by expanding deserts and drought in regions that are already dry, increasingly large and intense forest fires, rising sea levels, extreme ENSO oscillations with more coral reef bleaching, collapse of our major fisheries, extreme weather events, increasing frequency of category 3,4,&5 hurricanes, shifting monsoons, and torrential deluges especially in eastern China and the eastern US. If we continue with business as usual it is probable that by the end of this century we may lose much of the eastern seaboard to a rising ocean and perhaps as much as 1/4 of Florida. Miami will be under water as well as Washington, Manhattan, Long Island, etc. The loss in infrastructure will amount to many tens of TRILLIONS of dollars. In SEA the major low lying rice producing deltas will be flooded and as many as 500 million will lose their homes and livelihoods. The tropics will become unbearable due to wet bulb temperatures exceeding 35 C. Human beings are large mammals with an internal core temp. of 37C. Very humid conditions at high temps will kill us in about 4-6 hours unless we seek relief indoors. Even parts of the southeastern US will be uninhabitable during the summer. Unfortunately, the die may be already cast as total global emissions continue to exceed 40 Gigatons of CO2 yearly while methane levels are also going up. By 2050 we will certainly exceed 500 ppm and by this time agricultural yields in the US will certainly be significantly reduced (25-50%) unless we adopt geoengineering, solar/wind, and C sequestration on a massive scale. The evidence for the decrease in the resiliency of our planet is already evident- 50% of the Great Barrier Reef died last year while the Amazon has become a source of C not a sink. Desertification, loss of natural pollinators, over pumped aquifers as well as soil erosion will limit our population growth. As with all animal populations that explosively exceed their carrying capacity human populations are no different. We are animals subject to the physical constraints of nature. We foresee the deaths of many billions in the coming century along with the collapse of industrial society and global trade. This in turn can be expected to foment war and unspeakable human tragedy. Unless we act quickly now to avert this catastrophe the biosphere and its ecosystems will degrade and the oceans acidify leading to mass starvation as civilization collapses.",-0.992,591
