No insults name calling, but no he had to be full of himself and think he was bigger and more important then Tom Brady and thought he would put him in his place with his comment. What he found out is how someone ends and idiots tirade before it even begins; and how that idiot most likely just lost his job. Tom Brady like many other celebrities who try to cash in on their names via the reality show phenomena will learn the hard way that;  the end result is hardly worth the, hardship, hard feelings, and possibly even damaged relationships when it's all over.
