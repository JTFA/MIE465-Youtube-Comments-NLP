"Ex Animus Johns Hopkins has an official stance after thorough testing. “cHugh, the hospital's chief of psychiatry from 1975 to 2001, still believes that being transgender is largely a psychological problem, not a biological phenomenon. And with the title of University Distinguished Service Professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine, he continues to wield enormous influence in certain circles and is quoted frequently on gender issues in conservative media.


""I'm not against transgender people,"" he said recently, stressing that he is ""anxious they get the help they need."" But such help should be psychiatric rather than surgical, he maintains.

Hopkins, however, is moving beyond McHugh. This summer, it will formally open a transgender health service and will resume, after a 38-year hiatus, an accompanying surgical program.


Once at the forefront of gender-identity science - and site of the nation's first ""change-of-sex operations,"" as the headlines announced in 1966 - Hopkins abruptly halted those surgeries in 1979.


The main trigger was a study by Jon Meyer, who ran the hospital's Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit. In the study, Meyer concluded that although ""sex-change"" surgery was ""subjectively satisfying"" for the small sample surveyed, the operations they underwent conferred ""no objective advantage in terms of social rehabilitation.""

""With these facts in hand,"" McHugh later wrote, ""I concluded that Hopkins was fundamentally cooperating with a mental illness.""

Two months later, its gender-identity clinic was shut down.”",0.4767,280
