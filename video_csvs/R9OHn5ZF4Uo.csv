"This video put it nice and simple, but to dig further: I watched a video on self driving cars in my AI class some years ago and it made the connection between how we engineered planes and how birds fly. At first we imitated the birds flapping and that didn't work out. But we did come to understand the aerodynamics of birds. Then we did the same with AI and for a long time we just went at it on our own until the question was asked ""how do *our* brains learn?"" And brains remember things by firing synapses. We recognize things when similar synapses fire and this is the basis for how AI ""learns"". So then we begin our attempts at reverse engineering nature. For a bot it could learn by seeing similar color patterns in an image it gets from a camera (for example). And then we saw footage of a car driving itself by learning the path of a road. It was easy because we already do something to the road to make it easy to follow it's path: the paint lines and then we got a shot of the images it was getting and it was taking them in black and white and brightening the paint lines and road edges and this makes it easier for the AI; I imagine by now they don't need to do any image processing to keep it simple for the AI. From there the algorithm needs to calculate the turn radius to successfully navigate an empty road based off the images it gets. Obviously this technique can be expanded to not just recognize the path of a road, but also to people's faces or objects in an image (like in Google Pixel 2's object recognition feature).",0.9428,325
"This was fascinating. I appreciate your talent for condensing a difficult concept into such a short video and presenting it in such an easy to digest way.

To be honest, a lot of these concepts would take me a much longer time to grasp without access to your videos. 

One such concept is quantum computers. I do not understand what quantum computers are or why they're better. I recognize the words ""quantum"" and ""computers"" but together, they're gibberish. I'd appreciate it if you would make a video explaining this concept.

Or don't, everything you make is amazing. Keep it up!",0.9541,116
