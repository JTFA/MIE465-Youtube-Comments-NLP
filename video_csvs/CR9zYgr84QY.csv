"@MarieBach Thanks, Marie! Great to hear you're on a mission to become vegan. I wish you luck with your journey! I already  follow many vegan youtubers but I also like to find cooking inspiration from other channels and am interested in trying to see how things can be 'veganised'. I'm not currently following Niomi Smart so will check her out! Thanks!",0.9805,70

@kilroyscarnivalfl Thanks for all the tips and suggestions! Some great ideas. Will try using vegan butter and aquafaba. I'm pretty sure palm shortening is available here in the UK but from what I've heard about palm oil products and their negative impact on the environment not to mention their negative health impacts I'd be more inclined to use an alternative.

Same goes for pancakes, rather settle with a few lumps than overmixing. :)",0.5719,72

Judgement is approaching fast, and Jesus is the Only Way to escape since He took our punishment on Himself on the cross. He was not counting our sins, He was working to redeem us! Hallelujah! And He has! But will you receive it today by making Jesus YOUR Lord and Savior? 
The next hour is not promised to us, but Free Salvation in Christ is! Hallelujah!

You aren't waiting for the meringue to cool enough. The butter is being melted by the heat of the meringue and separating. I honestly leave my meringue to beat for at least 20 mins before I come near it with the butter. A simple solution if it goes soupy is to put it in the fridge for a few minutes to help cool it down and then start beating it again until it comes together.,0.8126,79
"You might be able to vegan-ize this recipe by using a vegan margarine in place of the cupcake butter, as long as it's suitable for baking, and something in place of the eggs. I've heard that Aquafaba, the thick liquid that canned chickpeas and white beans come packed in, can be used as a sub for eggs due to the texture and protein content. Have you tried this? As for the frosting, if you use something like palm shortening (is that available where you are?) which isn't hydrogenated, you can make frosting but it won't have the butter flavor.  Finally for the ganache, you can use full-fat coconut milk to make ganache, which I didn't know (just found a Martha Stewart recipe). I'm not vegan but like to make some vegan stuff for any gatherings where someone might be.  This recipe has a lot of natural flavor, and the cupcake batter isn't particularly egg rich, so it seems a good one to experiment with.",0.8253,186

"i'm supposed to be making this in 2 days, so can someone pleaseee tell me what i can substitute dark treacle with exactly because i cant find it in my country and its to late to order online. the closest thing i could find was molasses (rayner's classic crude black strap molasses).
the second thing is self rising flour, i cant find that anywhere either?! so what can i use instead of that?",-0.6544,82
in all of your videos you use caster sugar can you use regular sugar? i live in the states and its pretty hard to find fine sugar,0.5574,28

"looks yummy, but, what do you do with all that leftover butter cream? Fill more cupcakes? (I am honestly wondering, because making a small enough batch for just a few cupcakes seems like a super-fiddly thing to do, also, that's an excellent excuse to try making ganache again (last(and my first) time I tried it, I stirred the boiled cream into the chopped-up chocolate over simmering water, the whole thing got too warm and started splitting :/ even whipping didn't save it, oh well, now I at least know how to not do it :D",0.8556,111
