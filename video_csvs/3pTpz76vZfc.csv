"+Kelin Escobar - I already saw you say cis, and yes, it is everyone's business, especially for those in the spotlight.  It is morally unethical for a transgender person to hide the fact from a person they would have an intimate relationship with.  And if it is a celebrity who was being dishonest about it, well, it will definitely be blown wide open.  Besides, they're the ones who want to be open about their choice, so don't try to cover up their truth, just because it makes you uncomfortable.",-0.296,102
