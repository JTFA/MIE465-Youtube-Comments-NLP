But really the masses dont care that they saw a dead body. Its part of life. Its morbid curiosity. Get over it and grow up. People die sometimes by their own hand. Why are you so afraid to confront it? Its not cause hes white, like you. Or a male, unlike you. Its about what the masses care about. And it would seem you are just flat wrong. So keep talking about that white male privilege that really only exists for Rich people. Cause I have never been treated any different than any other poor person I am around, like garbage. Pass some of that privilege please? Go cry about your channel and keep it off of real news sources.",-0.6997,178
