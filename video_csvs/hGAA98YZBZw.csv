"His first move - get rid of Reggie . That terrible GM has never been on a team that had any kind of defense. Green Bay had to out score everyone by putting up 30+ points every game. If Gruden wants to win, that guy has to go. Gruden needs then freedom to build a good defense and not just work with whatever Reggie brings in.",0.8487,72
