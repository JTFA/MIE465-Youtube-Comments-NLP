"*Nintendo, I love this game! Please  look into some of these ideas, for one last (paid?) DLC to keep us challenged and therefore invested even longer:*

Something I believe could be easily applied and really change the dynamic would be a *much smaller inventory* , allowing you to only carry a handful of armors and weapons. Also having less materials with you would mean a little bit more planning on which area you will go to or which fights to pick.

A *thougher economy system* would make it harder for players to buy loads of arrows and materials, really bringing out the survival aspect. A lesser chance of mining valuable loot could tie into that.

*Destructable armor* would add to that too, since you'd have to constantly buy them anew. On top of that, imagine the thrill of losing your Orni armor in the middle of the Hebra mountains, making you rely on warming meals you've been wise enough to cook beforehand!

You could even go so far as to make *fast travel cost rubins or items* , forcing you to think twice if a fast travel is really worth it. The farther you'd want to fast travel, the higher the cost.

Add *infinite recurring quests* from NPCs, who will pay you. These could be monster hunts or material gathering.

And last but not least, since everyone loves Eventide Island, make the *blood moon nights strip you of all inventory items and allow no saving* , so you have to survive the entire night. If you die, you only get a fraction of your equipment back.

I believe these changes would keep up the challenge and make the wait for a sequel so much more endurable. :)",0.9198,330
