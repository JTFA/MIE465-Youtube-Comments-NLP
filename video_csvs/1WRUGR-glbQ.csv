"javier9119 That depends entirely on the fondant. Some of it tastes terrible but functions well and lasts a long time (useful for large cake projects or cakes made a long time in advance). However there are some great tasting fondant recipes out there (there's a marshmallow fondant recipe I've had that was tasty). In most cases, the fondant is very sweet and/or bland though, so its a personal preference as to whether or not you like to eat it. Any excess fondant can be stored and rerolled for another project another day, so even if it's tasty the extras don't usually get eaten on the spot. Garbage cake doesn't all get eaten either... things like cake pops were invented to make sure all the garbage cake gets enjoyed <3",0.9618,145
