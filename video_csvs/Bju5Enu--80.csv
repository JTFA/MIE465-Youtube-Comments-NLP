"""Is there any amount of friends or love that you could believe you are likable?"" It can happen. Yes. Sort of. Like for instance, I get told I do a great job at such 'n such task. I have done it enough times and screwed up enough to not screw up anymore. I have been told by multiple people, over multiple times I do that task well. Repeatedly told, and internalized. A part of it is what I have been told, but more so it is what I believe of what I have been told. It's me that decides and believes. Shifting gears, if I don't believe I am likable or lovable and someone else clearly states they think I am. Is the onus on this other person to convince me of my negative outlook?",0.9355,155

"I feel like people need to have a base level of likeableness -- which we try to achieve through politeness and hiding the riskier parts of our personalities -- so we can get stuff done.

"I know I'm annoying. I say stupid things and don't communicate well. But people still hangout with me. Little backstory, I have a shitty syndrome called PoTs I'm homeschooled cos I faint whenever I i try to stand up. Im lucky that I have social media to connect me with people and sometimes I get to hang out with my ""friends"" but I only get see them once every few months. The thing about being sick is that once you turn someone down, they will never invite you to anything else. You reach out and you see them and reconnect but you can't really even be close to them. I don't know if it's me or my illness that makes them not like me and I never know how to make myself more likeable. And I can't know how to change if I don't know exactly what's wrong. Idk I just wish people were honest and just said that they like you or said that they don't. I also wish I wasn't sick but these wished are both incredibly unreasonable. Idk what this was or why I just wrote it or why I'm going to share it with the internet but oh well",-0.8957,218

"I'm an NHS therapist and Dodie's technique of ""halting"" thoughts and weighing up evidence is exactly right. It's called thought challenging aka ""Taking the Thought to Court"". Only solid evidence -- facts, not opinions -- can stand up in a court of law and this is the same principle. You can then take it a step forward and come up with a balanced and realistic thought that takes account of both sides of evidence e.g. ""I did upset this person that one time BUT we solved it and they still like to hang out with me. They told me they forgive it so I can let it go.""",0.81,125

"People who are the most confident in their competency and including likeability are usually the least competent and least liked.  The opposite is also true, that those who have a high degree of self-doubt are the most competent and most likeable.  You have heard so many people compliment you on your skills and likeability, yet you still have self-doubt.  That's totally normal and somewhat expected.  But do remember this next time you begin to self-doubt, that it's ok you feel this way because that can actually motivate to reach higher.",0.9117,98
