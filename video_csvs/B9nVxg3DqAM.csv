Even his nerf...I can´t feel it in game, I still get my 120 damage from it. Another thing is balancing snipers...that a widowmaker can shoot like 3 times in a second even if it wouldn´t deal to much damage just isn´t right. A sniper is supposed to deal high damage while having a longer period to reload. There are still many things to fix and I guess champs have to be nerfed and not buffed any longer...otherwise we will have a one-hit-K.O. game in a few months.

"Hey guys, so I have a question and a suggestion. On competitive, why is our starting SR based on our last SR for the previous season? I mean I haven't played competitive really in the last 3 seasons because I was trying to improve and widen my hero pool because OW is my first fps and I really suck so I was trying to get better, and when I won most of my placements and really did well in the games I still end up in bronze because of my last performance last season. To me it just seems kind of unfair because the system doesn't take into account how much you've grown in the off-season and just bases your SR on the last season. So why can't we all start fresh or at least not hold us down to only the previous SR and try to compare our performance to those higher ranked players? That's just my thoughts on it tho.",0.8983,171

I’ve got an idea for hanzo. Instead of scatter arrow he could have like 4 arrows in his quiver and use it kind of like a shot gun. The dps would be kind of weird but I think it should be able to do 180 dps if all the arrows land ( meaning that each arrow does about 40 damage). Just a thought. It would also take more skill to use in close quarter fights,-0.5017,82
"I’ve noticed people talking about changing Mercy. Mercy is a strong support character that can be used in competitive play and I am one of many who like her character the way it is. So please don’t change Mercy. 
On another note I think Widowmaker is over shadowed by Hanzo, some ideas that I had in mind was to allow Widowmaker to use her grappling hook to hang on walls and ceilings without a ledge like a spider. And to remove the bullet trail animation when she shoots becouse no other sniper has a bullet trail and this gives away her location. Do any of you agree with these ideas?",0.9732,121
