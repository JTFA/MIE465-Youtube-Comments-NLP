"There is no logic in having Damascus combination on an anvil that will then serve to work with other strong materials..
Which will easier damage the weaker steel part.

Since making Damascus steel involve to have 1 part STRONG steel, and one part WEAKER steel.
To get the visual effect.. (and the visual effect is the whole point of making Damascus).

Sure, it is a tiny anvil, but still...Why?  (to test and improve your skills??).
If you are only after the Visual effect, and to test and improve your skills.... make a Damascus skull helmet.",0.8587,116
