Alvaro Ampudia it was the stock saw blade that came with my miter saw i bought about a year ago. Still a good saw blade but i got a better one that was on sale,0.7003,36
"Awesome build man. From the looks, it seems like that the tips aren't sharp enough. But maybe that's just my angle. I'd use a cutting wheel in a drimmel if it were me ;)",0.7906,38
Awesome video,0.6249,2
Builder's Workshop its hard to stay motivated when you dont receive the views you deserve for your hard work. Youtube is a very competitive place. I share my vids on other social media also. As far as scheduling goes just set a deadline for yourself ( i do every two weeks) and stay focused.  If your goal is to get views it‚Äôs going to be difficult. Hope this helped. Also i havent put a video out in a month so it‚Äôs not easy for me either.,0.7173,98
Cool man. Glad to have you. Thanks for watching,0.802,11
Deputy Steel haha oh ok. I‚Äôm glad you like my videos and i‚Äôll have to add your idea to my list,0.8658,26

Kamal AL-Hinai The tips were actually very sharp. The issue i had was with the edges. I dont have a proper setup for sharpening yet and the belt sander kept burning the metal. But thanks for watching man.,0.4404,42
