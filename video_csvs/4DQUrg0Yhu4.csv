I'm not sure about the legality of this, but you might be able to use molecular sieves to dehydrate the now methanol-free wash and circumvent the TTB's regulations regarding ethanol distillation.  Since the ethanol would now already be concentrated, you might legally be able to distill the remainder for the sole purpose of removing contaminates from the ethanol.

However, I think your conclusion about prohibiting Moonshine is in contradiction to your other opinions about recreational drug use and abuse.

I think prohibitions are the same as War on Drugs and basically encourage ignorance and higher concentration/more dangerous intoxicants. I'm not saying moonshine production should be a free-for-all but it would be better if there was public education about the dangers of accidental Methanol production and consumption. And maybe a safe, educated, legal way for people to do it that didn't require you to become a career distiller. Like maybe a U-brew system that is well regulated and promotes safe distilling.

Because inevitably some people will find a book or a website and try it themselves, and if they are trying to do it in secret they are more likely to mess it up badly.",0.7966,164
