Please people ... one does not have to be feminine to be artistic ... just because he is athletic doesn't mean he is not artistic. If he isn't artistic ... he would not be able to¬†get high composite scores to break records and win championships. But people will be biased against the athleticism and claim he isn't artistic. He is perhaps the most perfect specimen of athleticism and artistry¬†that I have ever seen on ice. Bar none!,0.9097,101

Of course Yuzuru capable of getting a higher score.  They both are.  Also, it was Nathan's first Olympics.  He will only get better.   Nathan broke three records with his 6-quad free skate, which the commentators brought up.  I agree Nathan should work more on his artistry.  He still got the highest score for the long program in these Olympics, so if Yuzuru wants to defend his title in the 2022 Olympics, he will have Nathan to contend with.",0.875,107

"Why does this feel like a rewind of young Hanyu? Back when he was only focusing on one thing (can't remember what it was - I'm the farthest from an expert here), but Brian Orser made him see that he needed to focus on a good foundation before moving forward, and THEN you can fine-tune whatever you want to focus on. I firmly believe that is how Hanyu got his gold medals. He had a great coach who knew the right way. This is just my unprofessional opinion, so help me out if I'm wrong, but it seems to me like Chen also needs to build a stronger foundation first, before moving on to greater programs and scores. 

That being said, Chen is still amazing - all these young people are, and the pressure they're under is seriously no joke.",0.9603,155

In any case, he didn't break any records (score-wise for free skate) despite his 6-quad free skate. He is good though, it's just that he needs to practise more on his artistry. Once he does, even if he falls on his jumps, he'll still be able to lie back on his pcs.",0.9822,107

Another four years of this stress would surely make me bald. Yuzu did the Olympics through sheer will, determination, and painkillers, as he is still injured. That's why he only did 4S and 4T. If he didn't botch his 4T combo and 3Lz then his score would be way more than Nathan's. Even with just Yuzu's 206 score in the FS with 4 quads, 3 landed cleanly, if compared with Nathan's 215 with 6 quads, 5 landed cleanly, that's amazing. Not to mention Yuzu only did 4S and 4T which have the lowest base value of all the quads. Nathan did a 4Lz which has the highest base value next to the 4A. Nathan also did 4F, higher BV than 4T and 4S. And now Yuzu is planning to add 4A.",0.7525,183
