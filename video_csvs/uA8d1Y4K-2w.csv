+Giovanda Richardson ....You dont know what type of relationship they had You talking to a Luther and PATTI fan....You probably dont know either history...If Luther was gay which he was and deceased NOW what is there to be in denial about and to who...? That clearly was (AT THAT TIME) ...for his mother and the women fans...Patti did what she knew was best obviously he chose HER to tell and talk about it with..If he was the president of her fan club I'm sure they covered a lot a things from then until his death..and Like I said were a few weeks away from 2018 people are not worried about that in the closet foolishness cause today is not like it was back then...barriers and history have been broken since then...and you sit there and defend Wendy Williams of All People that rusty hatchet face no good cow has NO respect for anybody considering her career is to destroy other peoples...as much as she talked about poor Whitney Houston before and after her death...Girl Bye.,0.2835,201

"Ah... so this is what everyone is talking about with patti ""Outing"" luther. I think people already had an idea and kind of knew, I don't think she necessarily outed him but speaking on his situation was sad to hear. I'm glad he chose not to come out because back then people were so harsh and by him being a man of color the black community would have ripped him to shreds acting like some interrogating detectives that he owed answers to. But in reality his personal life was his business and nobody else's especially if he's not in bed with you. But RIP to him, we as his fans love and support him",0.8094,123

The public claimed him as heterosexual and he was not. The very fact that he was gay and a brilliant singer was all the more of a reason for people to know the truth. Luther Vandross suffered in is last days on earth, due to the very fact of not coming out of the closet. Any gay man will tell you this is torture. Which could also explain why his life ended so soon, along with the other medical issues he had before his death.
