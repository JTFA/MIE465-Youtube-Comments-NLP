"As a male nurse, I felt that this video focused solely on the nurturing aspect of nursing and not on the critical thinking skills, leadership, and decisiveness required to work with acute patients, which is as important as a caring disposition. In doing so, you explored a very surface level explanation as to why men avoid this profession while simultaneously reinforcing the deeper stereotypes about nursing being an intellectually soft profession in which being kind is more important than being smart. This isn't so. We both collaborate with other professionals and direct their actions; we are the gate through which other professionals pass on their way to the patient, including doctors. Interestingly, many aspects of nursing ARE subject to automation, but the literature suggests that the future of nursing lies in Case Management, planning the entirety of a patients healthcare and organizing the resources to ensure they achieve their goals and remain healthy.

Prior to Nightingale men made up the vast majority of nurses but once Nightingale stepped in to a field domimated by men, whose care was severely lacking compared to Nightingale, that care drastically increased because of that femininity that was now present in the hospitality portion of hospitals. This rise in care was due to the fact that on the whole women are far superior at providing nurturing to the sick and weak compared to that of men thus changing how women and men see the profession, with men seeing it as a field more demanding for them in providing nuturment which on the whole doesn't come as easy to them and women feeling more right for the job due to more often than not possessing this skill.

Also, most people who argue for more women in STEM, but who is arguing for more women in low-wage men's jobs ? If a man wants to be a man, he's a sexist, mysoginist (or however way it's spelled) macho and is the enemy of feminism and if a woman wants to be a woman, working in a typical women's job - or even worse being a loving and caring mother and wife - she is either oppressed by a man or stands against everything feminism has fought for.

"Not quite on topic, but I think people get automation wrong a lot. Automation in the context of nursing e.g. is not necessarily an andromorph robot that replaces a human by doing exactly what the human would do. Instead automation is little helping devices, e.g. a heart rate monitor that can monitor the patients' heart rates throughout the whole day and aggregating all that information for all patients on the ward on one screen, so the nurses don't have to go from room to room to check if the patient is still breathing. So automation most of the time makes the work easier and more efficient (e.g. it would be hardly possible to have a nurse measuring the heart rate of every patient for every heartbeat around the clock). And if automation replaces a human, it is hardly ever a human-shaped robot who is doing that, but rather some kind of device that is shaped for the task.",0.7227,180

"So . . . ? Down with the Matriarchy for oppressing men. -- But seriously. This video is a bit more balanced than many I have seen on related topics and it is good to see women dominated fields addressed.

I have major criticisms. 

1) You mention the stereotype of a men not being nurses but you still lay the blame on men being too macho. So when a stereotype negatively affects women it's men's fault. But when one negatively affects men it's STILL men's fault?
2) If this was about a 90% male dominated field there would be NO requirements for women to try to change anything about themselves.
3) Where is the analysis of the working conditions? The women that constantly want the men to do all the heavy lifting. Need to lift a 300lb patient? Go get a man. You know because we are all equal.
4 ) There are a lot of caring men out there. Stop stereotyping men.

"Thanks for watching, and for the robust debate in the comments. I wanted to share the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that makes up the data visualization starting at 0:11. 

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/most-new-jobs.htm

A number of you have accurately pointed out that this list includes several jobs that are highly susceptible to automation (truck drivers, janitors, waiters and waitresses). It's important to point out that this is not a list of ""safe"" jobs that are immune to automation in the long term. It's based on labor economists' predictions about the occupations with the highest number of new jobs in the next ten years. Indeed, you'll find a number of the same jobs are classified as highly susceptible to automation in the Oxford study I mention at 1:25.

So how can a job have possibilities for growth in the short term while being vulnerable to automation in the long term? In part, it's because the technology that could eventually replace these jobs is still being developed. Trucking is a great example-- online shopping has pushed demand for truckers upwards in the short term, but as Christophe notes in Episode 2 of this series, the long-term outlook for profession is fairly grim.

"Was a nurse in both the U.S. and Canada for 20 years working ICU, CCU, and ER. Kinda stumbled into the job at time when some of the more traditionally ""masculine"" jobs like fire and police were going through hiring freezes or selective recruitment. So for me this was not something I dreamed about doing, but man, I had a blast doing it. 
It was exciting to work in different milieus and jurisdictions. Nursing is highly portable and with there being such a high demand you can go to a lot of places. The working environment was constantly in flux and you may go from feeling half asleep at 3 AM to huge adrenalin rushes as codes are called or traumas arrive; doing CPR, and even cracking chests. It was rarely boring. 
I suppose in the beginning there were the people who'd question mine and other nurse's masculinity and even our sexuality, but that passed quickly, and truth is it never bothered me. It is not a job for people of low self esteem. Most of the other men I worked with were very adventurous and I always had people to backcountry ski with or ice/ rock climb, mountain bike or any other number things. I worked with blackbelts and athletes, and in the US especially, many former military personnel. People who had seen combat and still wanted to help. So I don't agree with the view in the video pertaining to recruiting men on motorcycles or having tattoos or being manly as questionable. Men of all stripes can be caring. Nursing weeds out the ones who can't from both genders fairly quickly.
 After 20 years I ended my career to stay home with my kids, another non traditional role for men, but also a lot of fun and as any parent will say: an adventure.
My one pet peeve about nursing was being labelled ""male nurse"". Never did like that much. I went to nursing school but there were no classes specifically about being male."" I yam what I yam"", said Popeye, and pointing out the obvious just seemed unnecessary. 
I like to think that the early adopters of men in nursing make it easier for other men to get involved, and perhaps to a point we have, but the world is changing and I know my sons don't have the same fences around their identity as I did so who knows what the future will bring.
Side note: My wife is a doctor and and my youngest son had a reverse bias towards men in nursing, believing that all nurses were men and all doctors women. They are certainly not born with a gender bias.",0.9812,500

When it comes down to the day to day, being a cop is very like being a teacher, and being a firefighter/emt is very like being a nurse. In the former professions, your most important and most used skill set centers on being an effective leader and manager of people: diffusing conflicts, taking charge, enforcing rules and disciplines aimed at the good of all (sometimes quite against the preferences of the governed), all while aiming to make a lasting impact on the lives and wellbeing of citizens. In the latter professions, your most important and most used skill set centers on being able to stabilize a crisis: do what needs doing, bolster the suffering, be that white knight on someone's darkest day.
