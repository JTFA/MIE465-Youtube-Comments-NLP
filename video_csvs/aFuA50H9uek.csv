"""Note: This testing does not irritate or harm the robot.""

From the description. Read the whole thing - This is an important part of robot testing. Do you want your robots to stop working when someone accidentally opens a door into them? Or when someone decides to push them aside so they can get to where they're going? Not everyone is going to be nice to robots, and the world in general certainly won't be. What if a raccoon jumps on your robot while it's performing nightly duties? A box falls on it? It might be ""mean"", but unless you set up these situations intentionally, they're almost impossible to test for, and thus result in a less robust robot. No one wants that. Our robots will never be sentient unless we put them through this kind of testing, and thus it's a moot point whether it's humane or not.",0.6865,170

"The actions these people are taking are utterly incomparable to animal cruelty or child abuse. You have to understand that Boston Dynamics, and all the people working there, are the parents of these robots. They aren't their users, their slave masters, they are their creators. And the actions they're taking aren't cruel, they're formative. It's like letting your kid climb a tree, or teaching your baby how to avoid drowning. They ARE going to have to deal with situations like this in the real world, whether people are cruel to them or not. A shelf collapses, a fire sparks to life, a careless employee pushes them aside in a rush... These aren't cruel actions, but they would be devastating to today's robots, at the very least deeply disturbing. Boston Dynamics are, metaphorically speaking, trying to raise their robot children to be capable adults. Adults who can make a difference in the world, instead of just being cooed over at a trade show because they have ""potential"". These are the robots that are going to be saving lives. I know you mean well, I do, but if you were really ""raising"" these robots, you would find yourself either doing the same things, or setting them up to be the punchline of the future.

This isn't just about the robots being capable, it's about them being safe, too. How does a huge robot react to someone stepping in its path? Does it dodge them, or plough through them in a red mist? Even a robot the size of Big Dog or WildCat could break someone's bones if it wasn't robustly programmed. Your logic does not apply here.

And for the record, I think it's a terrible idea to do this kind of stuff to pets or children. Not only is it cruel, it's ineffective at communicating to them what you want. Robots are just a completely different animal, at least when you're developing them. If you end up with a robot in the workplace, though, do be nice to it :)",0.9442,389

"While you shouldn't bully your refrigerator for obvious reasons, and those reasons very much extend to more mobile and anthropomorphizeable machines, there is a point Joonas has in that we very often abuse machines for the explicit purpose of testing them. Look at car crash testing - This is a VERY important part of the automotive industry, but you must admit an individual car must necessarily go through heavy abuse for these tests to work.

The same is true for cognitive, digital machines - Algorithms. What is feeding a neural network an image or sound it wasn't meant to recognize, other than abuse? Yet we must, to see how it reacts, to learn more about how to make it better. Games must be broken by testers so that they can become more robust. Being nice to the things you create is foolish and will lead you only to failure.

That said, it is important to note that we already live in a world where we work alongside these machines. Attempting to be at least a little nice to them outside the lab, when they have little failures, isn't a worthless endeavor. Think of the beloved tractor the dedicated farmer works to maintain. Learning to use these machines is entirely different from testing them to the point of breaking. You can and should be kind to machines when it makes sense. You cannot and should not expect all people to always be kind to things just because they sort of look like your beloved pet with an unusually long neck, or a particularly oddly shaped neighbor.
