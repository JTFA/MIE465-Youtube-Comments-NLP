Guys the review at 3:50 is a ECG monitor NOT a pulse monitor. Huge difference! So you can’t compare the two. The ecg will give you a pulse but also a heart rhythm. You should be very still when checking it. The “light” only gives heart rate but NOT rhythm,0.2363,59
He counted the value wrong at 1:59 when he said it was 5:02  because it showed 0110 in the hour section. That is 0*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1. Each digit of binary further to the left of the dot is double the value of the previous digit. So 110011 is 51 in binary. So the time actually read 6:02.,0.1779,74
"Hey Matthias, awesome content I love it... Look, light (photons) are not matter for they have no mass, but they can sometimes act like matter due to Einstein's E=MC^2 (energy (E) =mass (m) * the speed of light (c) to the per of 2 (aka squared (^2)))...light and photons alike have energy, and bc of that famous equation, energy(photons) are the same thing as mass times the speed of light squared... That's confusing me too, but Idk, just realize that bc of E=mc^2, energy is the same as mass...anyway keep dropping banger vids luv ya",0.8403,136

"Simply put, light is weird. Being both a wave and a particle gives it some odd properties.
