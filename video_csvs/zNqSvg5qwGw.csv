"I know she's very famous for her role in ""B Instinct"" but I love her in other movies just as much if not better. ""B Instinct"" just showed the range of her acting. It was just one more character that she could act. Sharon Stone knows the difference between an act and real life and unlike other actors and actresses, she chose wisely not to confuse the two. She had REAL mom instinct keeping the family and herself out of the gossip cameras. Smart lady who doesn't live for her work but uses her work to enhance her life.

Sharon stone lives the life of glamorous old Hollywood stars like Joan Crawford Bette Davis Marilyn Monroe Rita hayworth etc etc but which is very refreshing. she knows how the Hollywood machine is and how it cranks out new stars left and right and also how it exploits some of them. she used her sexuality to get parts and did not let the big studio executives USE her. she knew how to play their game and still come out ahead but and for that alone I respect sharon stone immensely! she's no idiot.,-0.4574,98
