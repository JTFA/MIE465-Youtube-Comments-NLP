Contraversial films:
Batman v Superman(i personally liked it but this movie definatly is split in opinions.  A lot of people like it, and lot of people hated it)

Bad movies: Suicide Squad (had some good choices for certain actors but overall the plot was boring and they cut out way too many scenes of the character people wanted to see the most)",-0.7992,121

"I actually thought the same about how cool it would have been if Dr Poison was Ares. I thought her character was kind of wasted on the movie. In the end it seems the whole reason to include her was as an excuse for Steve to sacrifice himself, and then she's done. Maybe no Ares at all would have been an even better twist, but since he's a DC villain I knew he'll have to appeared eventually, it's just that when he did I was like... who's this guy again? Oh right, he appeared for like one scene back in the middle of the movie...

I think the problem with DC movies in general is that they're rushing to catch up with Marvel, when Marvel it's already so many years and movies ahead, and it shouldn't be a race. That's what ruined Batman v Superman, it was sooo rushed and had so much useless content and unnecessary plotlines it ended up being a mess. That's why WW felt so much better, it only had one story in it, so it could focus on character development instead of being just another Justice League teaser.

And yeah, I actually think Buffy is a show that has aged well and you might still enjoy today. Maybe Season 1 is not the best to prove it, but I hope it's good enough to give it a chance.",0.8652,255

"I like how everyone hates the ""Martha"" opening prologue scene, because everyone knows the name of Bruce's mother (sarcasm). Stop following the band wagon, you didn't put this together until everyone else did - the scene was important because a lot of folks didn't know the name of Bruce's parents and the latter realization scene humanized the alien Kal in Bruce's eye's. For all Bruce knows, maybe this is what could have turned Superman evil - if his mother died by the hands of Lex - forgetting that it is the death of Lois that triggers this, Flash Prophecy. For sure, now everyone knows the name of both Bruce's and Clark's parents. And might I add, showing us a Thomas Wayne as someone who wasn't a weakling was also so important - I totally see this Thomas Wayne as being Batman in Flashpoint.

"I understand what you mean, and it is fine. You are allowed to have an opinion, everyone is. The thing is, this time a lot of women who have never seen a superhero film are involved in the conversation, because it feels like it is the first time we've been included in the conversation. It is rude that you are immediately called a misogynist for expressing any opinion. Equality is me being able to explain my point of view, you be able to understand it, and me doing the same. I would even call it dangerous making a valid disagreement over a movie something you'd call sexism for. If you were objectifying her, demeaning the director/actress, saying she should not get a say in her contract, or calling for less pay due to her being a woman then that is sexism. I am sorry people have made you feel like you cannot express yourself. WW is a fantastic movie, it is my favorite movie. However, even I have criticism for the movie myself, for example the third act was pretty basic. I would have rather seen there be no Ares, and that it is just humanity being evil, or have a better Ares since the third act felt rush. It does not stop it from being my favorite. 

I know I said a lot of ladies I know have never seen a superhero movie, but I have. I judge every single movie by a ""did it make me feel like the first time I watched Iron Man?"" standard. Now it is the completely unfair ""did it make me feel like the first time I watched WW?"" which I am sure no movie will ever do again hahaha. If we are only talking about the movie, Civil War is not a fair comparison. You already had 5 movies that had already built on his story and another set of known (and unknown but familiar) avengers to rely on. Besides any movie with RDJ is going to be a good ass time lol. If you compare it to The First Avenger, then that is a fair comparison and I think we can agree that WW is better than The First Avenger.

Now Guardians, it is an origin story, but we did not have a clue what the characters were going to be like. I love that movie, it was actually my favorite until WW. It is an ensemble cast of superheroes, and even though it is beautiful and hilarious I think it is more of a comedy at times than a pure origin story. We get the background on the second movie, and Ego to me was team too much. I think the cinematography was beautiful in both, you have to admit that themyscira was beautifully shot. I think that Patty did a great job at making you feel what the war was like. I think that during Guardians I was more aware of the easter eggs. I do not think it is a bad thing, but I think they are different movies. I do think that just visually, I wish I lived in themyscira and those Oscar noms are going to be well deserved hahaha. You know there are going to be some big noms for WW. I mean Patty already got the Monster Oscar, and I just think she is great at working with her actors. 

I know it is a totally different story, but getting everyone to do an accent so Gal could focus on acting is amazing. I also felt like... have you ever played COD? So when you are able to see the little map on the screen? I felt like that, I knew where I was during the movie, which I feel like it is missing in a lot of movies, including Guardians. After watching the movie multiple times, like maybe way too many times, I do feel like she relied a lot on slow motion, but Guardians relied so much on humor even during serious scenes. I think that Guardians is great, but I think that WW had so much more heart and I was able to empathize with her so much more than with Peter. I was also able to empathize more with the Charlie and Steve more than with say Rocket or Nebula. I wish they would have made Dr. Poison Ares though! I was kind of expecting it, but oh well, I've already talked about the third act so much hahahah. Anyway, I look forward to seeing your rebuttal (hopefully, unless you are not a super cinema nerd who loves to talk in detail about the characters and every shot on the film hahahah) 

I don't know, I might think about giving it a try. Is it actually really good? Like does it hold up or do I have to put on my early 200s glasses on to see it?

"No offense, but you're still missing my point. I appreciate your explanation, and I would probably agree with you if I had any say in this, but I have man-parts, so I can't really. But I hear you and I get it, and I'm glad this movie has done this for so many women. It's awesome, really (I'm not being sarcastic, by the way, just wanted to make that clear just in case it's perceived that way, like the ""just kidding"" was perceived as petty, which wasn't my intention, so... sorry about that).

But again, that was never my point. By your own words, I couldn't even see that because I'm not the target of that part of what made the movie so good.

I just see a superhero movie that as a whole was a lot more than just one powerful scene for women who felt identified. And as a whole, I think it stands out in no small part because it's part of a cinematic universe where this was the only successful and decent movie.

To me that opinion is completely unrelated to all the women-empowerment thing, and I feel like every time I try to say that or any other thing about WW, all I get is a ""shut up, you can't have an opinion about this perfect movie because you're not a woman"" kind of response.

PS: When I said: ""...without being labelled mysoginist or sexist or just being told one's opinion isn't valid because one's not a woman...""
I didn't mean you called me a mysoginist or sexist, that was just an example from the other thousand times people has argued about this. I was generalizing how talking about WW always comes down to this argument. In this particular case, I meant it was the third example, the ""your opinion doesn't matter because you're not a woman"" thing.

PPS: I'm sorry if you didn't felt like Buffy wasn't targeted at you, but if you think that show (or Tomb Raider games) are for men who enjoy watching pretty ladies fighting, let me tell you... you should totally give Buffy a chance, because it's sooo not that at all.

"Remy, I am not calling you a misogynist, dude. I will use the same rhetoric as you did, that way we can talk the same language. Wha...? How..? What did that even have to do with...? 

Ok. 

The thing that pisses me off is that you assume that because I am telling you there is something you cannot understand you immediately think I am calling you sexist or a misogynist. 

Let me explain my point again: I am telling you that there is no way you would ever be able to understand how that movie affected women everywhere. Every woman I've talked to uses the exact same scene, where every man is telling her ""no Diana, you can't Diana"", and then she goes into No Man's land. Every single woman I have talked to has experienced something similar and said a variation of ""I did not know I needed to see that."" Every single one has felt emotional during that moment, because it is an important moment. The movie is about a woman, made by a female director, that is my point. In my opinion it was better than Civil War and Guardians, but that is because of those moments that there is no way you could experience, since you are not a woman. It is not an attack, it is just a fact. It is the same as me being mad because you tell me I don't get how great it feels to pee standing up (I imagine it feels great, I wouldn't know because I'm a lady with lady parts!)

And since we're in the subject of Wonder Woman let me tell you that Buffy never had the budget that Wonder Woman did and in my school/town (I emphasize my school/town because this is a personal experience that was shared by the women I know) it was considered a show meant for nerdy guys who wanted to get off to a lady fighting monsters just like Lara Croft. Therefore, women in my life (the lives of my friends from different cities/countries) did not watch it. It did not have the marketing towards women the way Wonder Woman did. Even if you'd like to mock me by making me out to be a man hater, which I am not, usually the men I talk to can understand when I am explaining something from a different perspective. I mean, you can I don't care. Buffy and the majority of these female based things were not made by women. The majority of male superhero things you like were not made by women either. The majority of stuff is not made by women or for women. That is why Patty Jenkins was so important, and why Ryan Cooger is so important to Black Panther. 

I want to put a petty just kidding, but I'm not. I'm just trying to help (maybe make you since you seem reluctant?) you understand why it is obviously more significant towards women than it would be towards men. (Not kidding!)",-0.8337,574

BvS needed less in a few shots, a shorter chase, and a shorter Doomsday fight. Winder Woman needed a faster set up and several scenes shorter. So really a little tightening on the editing and these movies are great. People say Marvel is better but most of those have a lot of issues editing can't fix.",-0.1655,93

Ok.

This is another thing that pisses me off. One cannot say anything bad about Wonder Woman (as a man) without being labelled mysoginist or sexist or just being told one's opinion isn't valid because one's not a woman, when I never even mentioned or made any sort of reference to the fact that she's a woman, and that's totally unrelated to my comment.

Let me try to explain my point again: I think the movie (the movie, not the character, not all women... the movie as it is) is good, but it seems way better than it is because it's surrounded by bad movies from the same studio. Compared to Batman v Superman, it's amazing. But I would say Civil War or Guardians of the Galaxy are even better movies overall in that genre (or insert any other example if you disagree on my opinion of those 2 particular Marvel movies).

And since we're at this subject now, Wonder Woman is not the first female hero or the first movie that empowers women as badass heroines. As a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I'm offended by people thinking otherwise. But maybe I'm wrong because Buffy was directed by a man, and we all know all men are the devil, so whatever (just kidding!).",0.944,262

"Why do people mind the Martha part so much? It humanized Superman to Batman. Batman spent the whole movie saying Superman is not human, Superman is not human. But all of a sudden, he's down there, bleeding, hurt, and asking Batman to save his mother, Martha. Of course Batman has no choice but to see Superman as something else than alien at that point.",-0.1779,75
