On top of him being stupid, his probation officer is the  reason why he's in jail. I'm unclear if he was in court for a already scheduled probation check or if probation filed a ""motion to revoke"" because of the NY incident.

"Keith Sweeting I understand you are upset that Meek is in jail but Meek wasn't put there for running a stop sign once. Meek was put there for repeated acts in which he violated the law and was arrested. From the court's prospective that is a spit in the face when they are allowing you to be out of jail and not serve your sentence behind bars. Meek agreed to the probation terms, he knows what they are, he signed them and he has to abide by them. Jumping Safaree on video, doing wheelies on video, fighting in airports, etc. all in a 6 month span will land most people back in jail. Probation is put in place to give you a chance to not be in a cell the majority of your day. We have to start holding people responsible for being irresponsible.

With that said, probation being a trap is a real issue for many of us black and brown people. It is a worthy goal to address and a real problem in society specifically for those that can't afford an attorney. I have sympathy and fight for the father who works two jobs while on probation who literally goes to work and comes home to be with his kids and does nothing else and because he ""ran a stop sign once"" is back in court (for the record I have NEVER seen a judge revoke probation for a stop sign violation or a speeding ticket that didn't amount to reckless driving).

"Terrell Pringle
Let me explain something to you that evidently you dont know. When you cop out to probation you essentially plead guilty to whatever crime you are on probation for.In MEEKs case it was a gun charge and drugs.

When u enter into probation it is basically a suspended sentence saying the courts will allow you to remain free under stipulations. Once u violate those conditions whether technical or with a new charge you terminate the contract.

By you pleading guilty in the 1st case they are able to revoke your probation and re-sentence you in accordance to the original crime you were placed on probation for. So if you were on probation for a gun charge the judge is within their right to sentence you to whatever that original gun charge carries. 

Probation is nothing to play with and its not a joke. So unless you have first hand knowledge of the being in prison then do your research. I know alot of u niggaz probably had your little weed charges and been to the county and think you know something. Until u have been inside of a law library and done case studies fighting your own cases then u dont know shit about how the courts work.

Niggaz need to wake up and understand this jail shit is not a joke , you sign your life away when u take probation and get involved in the court systems.

"Tyler Moore lol whatever you say bro. If you ever need representation in Virginia, DC, MD or Michigan give me a call bro. But you right Charlie Mack is not an upstanding citizen but he followed the court rules and judges love people who follow their rules... that's how you get off probation.",0.8271,59
"U have two types of probation violations... Technical violations and Direct violations.... Tech violations are failed urine test, citations, etc.. Direct violations are more severe like being CONVICTED of a new crime... Usually for technical violations (in meeks case) put u in a halfway house or on a program not jail time #freemeek",-0.9518,61

Vicious Pit no you also no what's funny I never encounter police why you ask because I don't break the law this guy kept getting in trouble that is why he's in this position I have never heard of any other person with this kind of charge get so many breaks,-0.6908,51
"WTF there are no discrepancies here.  If Roc Nation was dropping the ball it's not the Judge's fault if she keeps repeating there never used to be problem. GTFOH

Weren't any problems with Charlie Mack because clearly there was an improper  relationship between him and the judge. If he was so much better then why was meek not taking off probation early. Only reason would be the judge would be out of the circle and she couldn't live with that. Once again this man is in jail for a sanctioned wheelie and defending someone from harm both in which cases were dismissed by unbiased judges.,0.5479,80
"What people don’t seem to understand is we do understand the law and the way it works (jay z included) but it NEEDS to be rectified. You should not get 2-4 years for a minor speeding ticket or wheeling a bike. He is on probation due to a gun charge when he was 19. This nigga is 30 years old, a couple years later he joined ross and became one of the hottest artists in the game. In order to STAY hot, he had to travel. It’s clear as day that in certain situations when calling his PO, there were miscommunications in which his P.O. did not answer the phone nor did the P.O. choose to read emails. Shit like that is unjust. Attorneys should understand that when ppl sign in for appearances or performances they must meet this goal or they face legal actions.

Probation needs to be updated, that’s the point.",-0.886,180

Why didn't she ask about the accusation that the judge wanted Meek to remake a Boyz 2 Men song?,-0.25,20
Why would your lawyer go to a radio station & do an interview? Nothing good can come out of this for meek...He’s already in bullshit & his lawyer doing an interview & talking shit about the judge....IMO this is not the way to deal with this,-0.6705,53
"With all due respect... this attorney is reaching. She never said hire Charlie Mack she said your current management is trash and keeps f-in up and getting you into probation violations, probation violations your ex manager was preventing. For the attorney to suggest otherwise is BS. And if you read the full transcript you will see the real story and not this summed up version the attorney is trying to paint in a positive light for Meek. So let me tell how this will go... she will remain on his case because there was no wrong-doing.",-0.5719,104
Yea it don't look good to have him here when the transcripts say differently,-0.3412,14
"Yeah I understand where you're coming from. Just his line of work requires him to be around that, and altercations are bound to happen when dealing with the general public especially when people want to ""test"" how tough you really are. He is in the entertainment industry. He is being targeted as well think of how many people post wheelie videos on public roads everyday, if anything his fame hurt him her not helped.",0.6872,82
"Yes i did, they have evidence of a bias & emotional connection, not evidence of a recommendation by the judge. The clerk & parole officer’s words do not reflect in the judge.",0.4404,38

"john doe Ok. I'll check it out.

 ""In its original story, TMZ incorrectly reported that Charlie Mack had at one time been convicted on felony drug charges. That was not true. TMZ has now confirmed that Charlie Mack has a clean criminal record. He has never been charged with, convicted of, or sentenced for any crime.""",-0.5632,67
