"Anyone who thinks they are Immune from such a scenario Think again!  Not so much the stalking, but being classified and accused of something and can't vouch your way out of it.    I once was waiting at a bus stop for the city bus, a bus full of passengers finally comes, but it's displaying an ""out of service"" sign and continues onward.  An angry man on a bicycle throws a cup of ice against the bus.   A second bus arrives, I get on with the other people while that bicyclist continues riding down the road.  All of the sudden the bus stops behind that bus we saw earlier driving by.   The bus driver from that first bus comes onboard our bus, and points his finger at me and accuses me by saying, ""my passengers have said they saw you throw a cup of ice on the bus!"" He holds up both buses and calls the police and I am forced to remain there until the police arrives.   When the police arrives one questions me while the other talks to the bus driver, meanwhile everyone is forced to wait and become impatient.  Finally a customer comes out and says that I am not the one who threw the cup of ice.  The Police showed me to the other passengers on the first bus and they decided I was the wrong person.  Because of that passenger and the other passengers changing their minds after seeing up close, My livelihood was saved!   I wasn't sure how close I came to being arrested, but nothing I said could save myself because the bus driver had his passengers to back up his claim.   It was almost a nightmare, but I was finally free to continue on to my appointment I was supposed to go to!    Please remember, just because you didn't do anything wrong doesn't mean you are immune from any injustice!",-0.9879,347

I was so pissed off. I ended up spending a full two weeks in there cause the doctor said i was unable to leave due to my behavior. I was upset because i didn't want to be there that long. It was the week of my fathers birthday and i was literally held captive there hoping the doctor would give me the green light to go home. While being there they gave me risprodal that i didn't want to take. Every morning a priest came into my room to say a prayer and he was creepier than a mother fucker. It was some satanic bullshit.

"Not gonna lie - looks boring as Hell. 

I just don't CARE that this woman is being stalked because the movie market is already over-saturated with every single kind of tale that can be told about a 'fragile, struggling woman trying to make in this harsh modern world'. We've seen every permutation there is, pretty much.

We got the whole 'sexual awakening' tale with 50 Shades and Nymphomaniac. We got the 'surviving a horrible ordeal' tale from The Descent, As Above, So Below, the Annabelle franchise and Sicario. Hell, we even got the 'Girl-bonding' tales like Bad Moms and the latest Ghostbusters.

Like, enough, Hollywood. Woman are liberated and having their stories told. We get it. Would it really kill someone, ANYONE, to make some movies about a male lead character with male problems that ISN'T part of a damn Comic Book franchise??",-0.9837,172

Mine is that her stalker is the warden of the psychiatrist hospital she was put in. Her stalker wanted to dance with her for prom, but she refused thinking he was a loser. He develops an insecurity which turns into anger, and being the nerd that he is he decides to use his intelligence to fire back at the woman and make her uncomfortable for all the pain he went through from the feeling of inadequacy. With the help of her mother they manage to find out help her regain her sanity while figuring out the stalker's whereabouts. After all, if they follow you, then why not follow them back? The woman manages to escape from her room and finds her stalker in the ward while she spies on him. Eventually he catches her and she manages to get grip of a weapon and she kills him.",-0.9808,174

"Stalker Escalations, the cheesy & infantile stupid Hollywood Moment ones, all of which could have been stalled and suffocated even by a 12-year-old Kid, right of the Bat at the Beginning of this ludicrous Stalker Script & Scenario, are the only Thing which is nerve wrecking here. But only because it's pulling the Nerves and challenging the Patience of the viewer, on the Basis of Soderberg's Assumption, that the Viewer is somewhat stupid, and would likely tolerate seeing silly, non-logical and cheap HOLLYWOOD Tension making Attempts for a Scene. This is a bad Miscalculation by this Director. This is a famous Director, who not always has been successful with his Films neither, I need to be adding here. This is simply a bad Film. If no one would have mentioned his Name for this Film anywhere, no one would even talk about this Film anywhere on the Net, it would not even be worth the TROLLS and Critics who, as a consequence of being a no name, orphaned Film, would tear it apart into a million Pieces. It's such bad Hollywood Movie altogether. And what is this statement about an iPhone,... has anyone seen yet Backstage Images of his iPhone Camera Rig he built around that iPhone? And still it looks like an amateur, clearly non-professional DP Job. One who has not even discovered anamorph Adapter which exist for the iPhones for quite a while now, and which at least would have visually given his iPhones a more Movie-like look,... For that matter, there have been a few people shooting with iPhones, amateurs, non-professionals, who were able to make an iPhone clip look like it was shot on an ARRI with Anamorphic Cooke lenses etc etc.. and where Steven Soderbergh and his DP‚Äôs and Camera people, would never in a Million Years, be able to guess it was shot with an iPhone. This film is a Testimony and a direct reflection of Steven Soderbergh Eye for Film, which results in‚Äã a massive disappointment right now. And YES!! this Film should indeed encourage all half Pro's and wanna be's and amateurs who want to get into Movie making, to show precisely this Hollywood icon, Soderberg, how it should have been done with an iPhone.",-0.9531,424
