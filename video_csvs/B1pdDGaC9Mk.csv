"""..they have very bubbly and silly personalities"".. Not every woman wants to be bubbly. 
What would be wrong with a model being more calm? Her videos have a very relaxed feeling. A lot of people are probably looking for that. There are already so many other youtubers that fall into the opposite category...but many people just can't relate to them. 
Why do people only want to see one type of attitude/disposition? It's not how life is.
In the past though, there have been successful models who weren't always excited, animated, telling crazy stories, or whatever it is. Why do people expect that so often.",0.7313,125

", for me they have something in common, the similar personality I guess and little bit of weirdness Jess for me more feminine and cool and strong originality (omg sorry English is not my first language😂) and Tay is sweet tomboy laugh at her own jokes and hardworking, I don't know why I compare them they're different but have the same.. vibe (omg I should work on my English)",0.7402,77

Katie Logan I’m not upset at all. They asked what people see in her and I was saying how I feel. You seem a bit too obsessed with putting others down though. May I ask why you watch “a lot of her videos” when you don’t enjoy them? Why spend your time doing something that you don’t like?,0.7611,71
"Katie Logan how are you supposed to see or hear her laugh when all you watch is her makeup videos? She laughs alot on her vlog videos especially when she went to japan... I understand that you view her personality as flat but I think her monotonic(?) voice adds up to that factor.. I think that she is really bubbly too but others cant see it much because she doesnt show it through her action or movements much which is why I can relate to her.. when I recorded a voice record of mine for a school project...Now matter how happy I was, my voice still seems to relaxed and boring and such. But I like jess and you just voiced out your opinion",0.9388,135
