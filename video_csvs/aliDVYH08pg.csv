"Hey Simon, first of all I love your comics and animations <3 But I have a question, that some of my friends who too own cats, and I have been wondering for some time. I myself have two cats and I had one before these, and for some weird reason, they all seemed to love chewing on plastic. For example plastic bags, packaging and rubberbands. I've asked from vets and they didn't know how to explain it.. Our younger cat, Myrsky 4 years old, mainly concentrates on plastic, but our older cat, Syltty 15 years old, used eat paper, anything that had somekind of glue on it like envelopes or tape etc etc.. Has your cats done this? It would make a nice cat logic video, if an expert would explain this weird behaviour :) And both are in good basic health and do get enough to eat and play time with me :D",0.9838,173

"I got my Mokuba at Christmas 14 years ago. The next Christmas he decided to climb the tree while I was asleep. I awoke to a crash, and a large number of the glass ornaments I had spent so long painting we're broken. I switched to a small tree I could put on the table for several years after that. These days Mokuba lets the tree be, so I can have a regular size one again. Mokuba was an unexpected Christmas gift to myself. A friend knew someone who had found abandoned kittens and had bottle fed the litter. My friend got one, and she talked me into taking the last little runt. I will never regret it! He was so tiny when I got him, but he grew to be tall and long, twice the size of his sister. I always say  I got the cat I was supposed to get. He's got a strange personality, but we live together well.

"Jeremiah 10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.

5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.

6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.

7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.

8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.

9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.
