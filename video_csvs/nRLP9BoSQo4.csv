"And besides, #fakenews NYT would never create an honest title for this video: *Perversion As Art* . They will ways use some kind of euphemism. If Leftist Lunatics started calling things what they are instead of fabrications meant to distort the truth ( *illegal aliens* vs *undocumented immigrants* ), the world would be a much happier place, and they would be inconsolably miserable, something they want us all to experience, hence the perpetual, deliberate, mis-titling of their ""work"".",-0.6824,96

"Hi, cemcfarlin. Sure. 

Scroll upward until you find a black box. On the bottom-left of the black box, there will be a triangle pointing to the left. The triangle means *PLAY* . Click on it. There is another smaller triangle to the right of the first one. That triangle means *PAUSE* . To the right of of the smaller triangle are two more icons, for *SPEAKER* and *VOLUME* . You will need to set these last two if you want to hear what's in the video.
