"Am I the only one that isn't a fan of Kimmie's brother nor her husband? Kimmie's husband is extremely ANNOYING. Also Stephanie and Jimmy's relationship just makes no sense to me. Stephanie and Kimmie NEVER liked each other. They hardly ever got along. So, to now see Stephanie with Jimmy (who is exactly like Kimmie) and wanting to have a baby with him is crazy. I wanted her to be like Jesse and date until she found the perfect guy like Jesse found Rebecca 😔🙁😑",0.5736,96

Is anyone else not surprised that Steve got a job offer and have to move away as soon as they got back together? DJ and Steve are end game, but I knew that it was too soon for them to be together. The show  is about  DJ trying to raise her kids with the help of Kimmie and her sister etc.. Her being with Steve would've messed that all up. I'm  really, really going to miss Steve. We probably wont see him again until the series comes to a close😔🙁 However,. im glad that everyones is moving back. I'm excited to see how that goes.",0.7838,134
