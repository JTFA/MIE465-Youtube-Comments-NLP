Adele Wholoki'd and she also lowers the keys which is frustrating. I know she can do it. For example miley even makes her live versions even higher than the studio one.,-0.5267,34
"After these comments, I went to watch the Fallon performance and I'm guessing you maybe meant the YouTube performance? Fallon was a bit of a trainwreck and she was really really struggling to find even the right key let alone the right notes. But the one on her VEVO channel, performed in the YouTube Space, was really great and really strong. Lots more texture, control and really hit things well. Fallon, however, was like this one but even a smidge worse in places. YouTube Space was great.",0.7703,99

I honestly didn't know she can actually sing ..... not bad ..... not bad at all,0.8271,16
"I love Kesha and have always supported her but her recent live performances really let me down. I mean I know she's capable of delivering much better performances before, I was moved with her vocal when she sang True Colors and Till It Happens to You, I also love her voice in Deconstructed EP. It's not always about belting and high notes but she's off keys most of the time and her voice is really shaky. I hope she gets better and feels more confident in herself in the near future.",0.9841,97

Kesha - Kesha performs.. lmao,0.5994,6
"Kesha has a beautiful natural voice - when she sings country, which she grew up singing and comes naturally to her. She struggles with any other vocal style due to lack of practice. Belting in a pop song is beyond her. She had choreography lessons and a diet plan for 15 years, when what she needed was a vocal coach. Now that she's singing real songs live, we can all tell. Hope she rests after this tour and hires a coach to help with breath control. She's too nasal and it's hurting her voice.",0.6705,104

Marco Del Gallego so how many artists can you name where the live version is actually better? I can only name a few..,0.4404,25
Mateo Diaz the fact that she can't continually hit those notes shows her lack of vocal skill. She can only do it on occasion when she tries hard enough and even then she doesn't do it to album quality. She's really not very good in terms of being a supreme vocalist but as far as having a distinct voice I guess you can give her that. But quite honestly everyone just pities her and tries to act like she's better than she is.,0.8499,87

She did great!! Saw her live on Tuesday and she gave it ALL. Such a powerful voice if you can do that and then do this the morning after!!,0.8429,34
"She hasn't sung live for years, and her new songs are very vocally challenging. So she's just getting used to it. And I think, if singers can hit it in the studio, they can hit it live too. And she doesn't want to strain her voice too much either, which is understandable. Also, the whole high note shit is just dumb. Not only is it hard but it can change the voice. Look what happened to Mariah Carey. Maybe Kesha needs more stamina training but I think it would take me some time to adjust too if I hadn't sung live for years and them just jumped back into it.",-0.0021,123

"The lyrics and her story are of course inspiring and compelling, but I definitely feel for her. This isn't that great.",0.1177,24
The thing sith Kesha is that she writes her songs in a very high key for her and when she performs live she doesnt fills the studio version. Still an amazing performance,0.5859,33
"This is great! But I think she needs to let more of her voice out; I'm not sure how to explain, but's almost like she always cuts off the breath mid word. But it's much better (vocally) than  the EMAs performance. Still amazing!",0.8867,51
This is my favorite live performance of this song.. I wasn’t crazy about the MTV performance..,0.1531,20
"This song live, is aggressive. Especially the choreo. I think that’s why she cuts off her words like that.",-0.0772,25

Why did they make her do such a quiet set? She’s much better at loud songs and sets. She’s not a whisper artist. She’s much better at performing Praying and Let Em Talk than this.,0.8074,45
"Why so much criticism on her vocals? She's in key, hitting the right notes, and she is creating a beautiful, soft version of the song.. in my opinion anyway.
If anyone ever has a chance to go see her in tour GO! You'll never see her voice in the same way again. She was phenomenal on her rainbow tour,  almost every performance was better than the studio versions. I've always thought she performs better in places like this or in front of her fans.",0.9102,95
