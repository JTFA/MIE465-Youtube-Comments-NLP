"More interesting is the answer to the equation:

First, the vertical lines (| |). It is likely that many do not know what these mean or indicate. The bars simply indicate that the ""absolute value"" of a number or variable, that is the value without the sign denoted before in simple terms. For example, the absolute value of 10 is 10 and the absolute value of -10 is 10. You could also say that it is the distance from 0 to the number. To make the equation simple, I am assuming that the ""v"" in ""|ve|"" is the same variable used twice, which makes it's full term ""+4v|ve|(x+4)(x-711)"", or simply ""4ev^2(x+4)(x-711)"".

Also, in my statements, because there is no superscript formatting on YouTube (that I am aware of), I use ""^"" to identify indices (exponents or powers are also names for them).

Now, assuming the question is ""simplify the equation to find the value of A"", in simplest form, the answer is:
4783+4ev^2xf-2844ev^2+16ev^2f-11376ev^2. 

Which means that the full equation is:
x+4783-x+4v|ve|(x+4)(x-711)=4783+4ev^2xf-2844ev^2+16ev^2f-11376ev^2=A

After this full simplification, there aren't any more like terms to add/subtract from each other. Maybe if the values of ""x"",""e"",""v"" and ""f"" were disclosed, I could perhaps go to sleep, but here I am, watching videos of people playing songs from classic science fiction movies on pencil and paper while writing arguably ridiculous mathematical equations for me to attempt to solve.",0.6166,379

"Okay imma simplify it
x + 4783 - x + 4v|VE|(x + 4)(f - 711) = A
4783 + 4v|VE|(x + 4)(f - 711) = A
4783 + 4vVE(x + 4)(f - 711) = A
4783 + 4vVE(xf - 711x + 4f - 2844) = A
4783 + 4vVExf - 2844vVEx + 16vVEf - 11376vVE = A

Final answer:
A = 4783 + 4vVExf - 2844vVEx + 16vVEf - 11376vVE
