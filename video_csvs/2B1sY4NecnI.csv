"Before you post a nasty comment about Billy Graham remember that he preached love, forgiveness, redemption, equality, and above all Jesus! If we cannot respect that, then we should examine our own hearts! He made mistakes, he was human, but all of that just furthers his message! We are sinners and Jesus died that we may live for eternity! Billy was just a beggar showing other beggars where to find bread! Jesus is the one who gives light, love, life, and peace! Idk about you but I've wasted enough of my life! Jesus redeems us! Repent (do a 180) and put our faith in Him alone to forgive us of our sins!",-0.306,133

He started the most respected and charitable organization that actually used between 80 and 90 percent of donations to the target programs and out reaches. It is called Samaritans Purse and it answers a call to need around the world whether if be digging wells for poor African tribe or provided disaster relief for community suffering the ravages of hurricanes, floods, fire eat.

His mother Ruth couldn't comprehend what was so wrong with Franklin. ( now we all know what is wrong Franklin).......   Billy Graham was a good preacher, his teachings on the Bible were well interpreted and very impacting.   His political views   probably weren't fair.  It is why Religious leaders should be away from politics.  JESUS has a lot to say in the Bible; Stay away from politics, that's what he warned us.  Hopefully Billy Graham made his peace with God. He certainly is going to be missed.  R.I.P.",-0.879,169

"Billy had an amazing sense of humour and a keen sense of understanding. He was in a small town in NC holding a revival early in his career and needed to find the post office. He asked a little boy on a bicycle how to get to the post office. The boy gave him directions and Billy thanked him and told him that he was in town with the revival. The boy asked him what happens at the revival and Billy said ""I teach about Jesus and the way to heaven. Would you like me to teach you the way to heaven? The boy replied, ""I don't think so, sir. You can't even find your way to the post office.""  Another time, in the jungle of South America while visiting a native tribe with the intention of teaching the gospel to the tribes, he decided not to because the tribe already had a natural relationship with their creator.",0.9716,174
Billy is NOT with the Lord or in Heaven itself. Here are a few reasons why. 1) He took on the title of Reverend which in the scriptures is only for God. 2) He taught people the wrong way to be saved. 3) He was not part of the one and true Church Christ established and died for.,0.5106,66

"Christianity belongs in a cave as do any primitive people who believe in angels and demons and gremlins or whatever delusions they believe. Thankfully, our Founding Fathers created America to be SECULAR, with a separation of church and state so clear that even a child can understand it. Anyone who decides to check their brain at the door and follow a hateful and ignorant hick like Graham are the same people tearing this country to pieces with their ridiculous and hateful dogma. America is SECULAR, that means NOT a christian nation. If you want to live in a christian nation, go find one, because America is NOT it. I know you were told otherwise by your church elders and republican politicians but no, our Founding Fathers were DEISTS and they escaped a religious monarchy, they would NOT turn around and build an evangelical theocracy afterwards. Keep your religion to yourself. You should be thankful that we allow you to worship your asinine cult. But trying to change America will not be tolerated. Good riddance, Graham.

Such disrespectful comments. I can't stand how being a Christian means to the world as hateful people. Thank you Billy for never apologizing for your beliefs. I'm a millennial who loves Christ and not ashamed of it. I have my beliefs and respects others who don't share the same. How about all you hateful people respect others as well. Not everybody is going to agree with your beliefs accept it and stop being hateful.,0.7838,81

"The comment section is disgusting and horrifying. I hope you will all know God. Maybe some of the sermons Billy Gram gave could teach you something about decency. It is foolish to call this man evil or worthless, this is just plainly false. Billy Gram fought against segregation before the civil rights movement. He preached with MLK.

"The toxicity in this comment section is palpable, and disappointing, Billy Graham was by no means perfect but to everyone on their high horse applauding his demise, he was part of a family, just like you, his kin lost someone today, a son lost a father, a wife lost a husband and grandchildren lost their grand father. Would you like you or your family to be treated in this way, even if they disagreed with you, in their time of loss? I doubt it. Put yourself in their shoes, and for all the talk about love and tolerance today from both sides of the political and religious aisles, all I see here is hate. At least Billy had love, even for those he disagreed with.",0.4118,142

"voxxpopulisuxx I'm sure it is going quite well with whomever is there. What a glorious day to meet Jesus and to finally understand what life is all about!  Keep in mind that anyone who makes it to heaven does so strictly because Jesus makes it possible. It has absolutely nothing to do with good works, water baptism, praying to Mary or the saints, being a member of the Roman Catholic Church, a Baptist, Episcopalian, or whatever. Jesus said, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me."" He also said, ""Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."" What transpires between a believer and God is the most personal and intimate thing imaginable. An organized church, a priest, pope, preacher, evangelist, etc. is not required to administer ""salvation"" to anyone. Men of God are used by God to spread the gospel-- to sow seeds-- then God gives the increase. Also the veil of the temple tore into when Jesus died on the cross. The tearing of the Veil signified that each and every individual who accepts and TRUSTS Jesus as the perfect Lamb of God has direct access to God without the need of a high priest. Therefore there is no need for anyone to intercede for us. Jesus does that! There are flaws in how we organize our churches. The Roman Catholic church is flawed in a major way. It may have started out with good intentions but something went wrong  along the way. Protestant churches are flawed as well. We sinners have a way of messing things up. The only church that matters is the True Bride of Christ--those who are truly born again (spiritual birth). When we become his child we become royalty. This new birth transcends all denominations, traditions, cultures, and races. We all become brothers and sisters in Christ. We are a family. We are the bride awaiting the groome--Jesus Christ.",0.9932,386
