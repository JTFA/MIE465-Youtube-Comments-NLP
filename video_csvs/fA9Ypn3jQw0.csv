"Lyrics here if you want 'em:

Jumanji, it's the jungle inside your soul,
Somewhere deep inside at the end of the world.

Jumanji, and survival your only goal.
Plunge the jewel inside, say the name of the game.
Jumanji!

Sheldon Oberon, he can read the map.
Ruby Roundhouse, she can kick some ass,
Smoulder Bravestone, always on attack.
Little Mouse Finbar has a backpack.

Don't forget about me,
I'm Seaplane McDonough.
I'm here to save the day,
Whatever comes my way,
That's the game I play.
Jumanji!

Jumanji, it's the jungle inside your soul,
Somewhere deep inside at the end of the world.
Jumanji!
Jumanji!
Jumanji!
