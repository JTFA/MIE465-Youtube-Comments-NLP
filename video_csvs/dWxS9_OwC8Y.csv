"Hardest commercially available material is likely CBN, Cubic Boron Nitride.  Can be sourced as cutting inserts for lathes.  Material however is not 100% pure, uses a small percentage of sintering aid, commonly cobalt or various ceramics.  Cutting inserts of poly-crystalline diamond also exist.  My MS in materials science is primarily focused on industrial ceramics, I have some bits and bobs of some B4C and B4C/TiB2 composites produced via SPS which, though not nearly as hard, are quite tough.

"Nice. Came here from the link at Cody's.
I actually have some boron nitride, but it's the wrong kind. Just like carbon crystallizes in several allotropics with very different properties (diamond vs. graphite), boron nitride also crystallizes in different ways. The hexagonal boron nitride I have is a very soft, white dust. It's so soft that its main use is as an anti-friction agent. The one you're looking for is the tertagonal boron nitride, which is analogous to diamond, and which is very hard. I don't know of a source of large crystals of  that.",0.7691,111
