"God is Good.  And because God is Good He makes Heaven.  And because God makes Heaven He takes ALL to Heaven because God is good.  And Heaven is the Cure.  And because God is Good He wants to cure ALL.  And because God is God He will cure ALL.  Therefore ALL go to Heaven.  Because who wants to keep anybody sick lingering in a sickness treated with an ongoing treatment?  Since God is Good He does not want to keep anybody sick.  So God will cure ALL by taking ALL to Heaven.  Heaven is not the ongoing treatment.  God must take ALL to Heaven otherwise he is not good, And therefore not God.  And so this God is a better God than Jesus.  Some might say that then they won't have Jesus to guide them.  But they have each other and their parents and the government to guide them.  So God is Good ALL go to Heaven.
