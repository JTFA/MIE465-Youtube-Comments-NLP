Guys stop saying there's no after ganon story .  dlc is just supposed to be extra stuff Not anything to do with the main story .   if they  made after ganon story it would not be fair for people who don't have dlc cause that means you'd have to pay to complete the game,-0.6968,54

"I beat the new DLC. The game still feels underwhelming. I want more than shrines, skins, korok seeds. I want chain quests like in Majora's mask, or the building of Torrey Town in Akkala. I want to bring hope and change the circumstances of people and villagers in the game like you did in Twilight Princess's Kakkariko instead of absolutely no change in behavior whatsoever when you complete quests. An example of this is when you fight off the horse riding moblins outside one of the stables. I thought it was a great idea, but other than the moblins disappearing, nothing changed. The people weren't cowering before and walking freely after. They had the same walking patterns as before, and only one of them acknowledged the issue. Same with freeing the sheep on the beach. I would love to kite in to rescue a caravan being attacked by moblins so they can use their supplies to rebuild parts of the towns and open up access to different shops. I do love the combat very much, though. I hope they bring back the old Zelda model for the next one.",0.9812,209

"je pense que oui le download enrichie un jeu d'idées qui n'ont pas eut le temps d'être intégrées avant la sortie. Sachant que les idées sont de la création et qu'elle est constante. Ameliorer ou enrichir un jeu est génial si le prix du download est raisonnable. et la je trouve que c'était le cas. 19 euros pour un survival haletant et une nouvelle aventure ça le fait. il faudrait aussi sortir à la vente en physique une édition complète quand on sait que plus aucune création sera faite.
Au sujet de mes attentes:
- des ailes pour link et qu'il puisse voler en liberté.
- Replacer la mire de l'arc a l'écran. je perds encore à cause de cela.
- ajouter quelques sauvegardes à l'épreuve de l'épée. franchement c'est très/trop dur. je perds au boss basique. frustrant et rageant.",0.0,156
