Anyways here are the lyrics for those who want it haha
Like this so everyone can see :)

Hot and dangerous
If you're one of us, then roll with us
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
When we've got our hot pants on and up
And yes of course we does
We running this town just like a club
And no, you don't wanna mess with us
Got Jesus on my necklace-ace-ace
I've got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexified
So let's go-o-o (let's go)
Tonight we're going har har-har ha-ha-hard
Just like the world is our our-our our-our-ours
We're tearin' it apart part-part pa-pa-part
You know we're superstars, we are who we are
We're dancing like we're dum dum-dum dum-dum-dumb
Our bodies goin' num num-num num-num-numb
We'll be forever young youn-youn youn-youn-young
You know we're superstars, we are who we are
D.J. turn it up
It's about damn time to live it up
I'm so sick of being so serious
It's making my brain delirious
I'm just talkin' truth
I'm telling you 'bout the shit we do
We're sellin' our clothes, sleepin' in cars
Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes (hard)
Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexified
So let's go-o-o (let's go)
Tonight we're going har har-har ha-ha-hard
Just like the world is our our-our our-our-ours
We're tearin' it apart part-part pa-pa-part
You know we're superstars, we are who we are
We're dancing like we're dum dum-dum dum-dum-dumb
Our bodies go num num-num num-num-numb

Not only is she beautiful, genuine and talented AF, she also comes from very modest origins and is extremely humble because of her upbringing. Not to mention I kinda have a connection to her. My uncle Jim was one of her tour managers years ago. He loves her too apparently haha. He says she’s not “one of THOSE kinda pop stars” which I find so amazing. She was always so kind and respectful to him and her other managers/agents and I honestly believe that too. I’ve been wanting my dad to ask him if I could meet her but my uncle hasn’t talked to her in a while since he stopped going on tour with her so yeah 😕",0.9527,153
