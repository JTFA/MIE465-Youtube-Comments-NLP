"10 to 15 years??? I started listening to Kpop via YouTube but then started looking into the groups because there are such large numbers in each group and I cannot imagine them making any money at all, if it’s anything like the USA they are not making shit. :( Then I fell down the rabbit hole about the slave contracts, no girlfriends or boyfriends policy, and not making as much as they should be making. I wish the fans would change and lay off them. Show the management companies that the men and women in Kpop group’s should be allowed to date. Being in your 20’s is some of the best times of your life. Best for dating and having fun. Finding yourself, figuring out what you want to do, and what kind of person you want to be. They should be allowed to date, go out, and enjoy themselves. Their fandoms don’t help this at all. :(",0.992,185
"2 dollars a day for ten years ?? If i were you , 3-4 years is enough for me to break ""my contract"" rather than be a slave without making money for ten years ..when I watched i can see you voice and most of them were a talented​ former idol , sometimes i feel it based on lucky",0.4871,64

I have an issue with this because its not just the music industry in Korea its the entertainment industry in general. The culture itself put too much pressure on themselves. They have one of the highest suicidal percentages. When starting off with the korean culture i was surprised at how many actors and singers killed themselves and they don't have the support and resource to prevent it. This has been going on for years now Shinee member passed away and the quack doctor that was suppose to help him only made it worse.,-0.8767,98

I could never understand people who can't accept not everyone drinks. It's ridiculous to me :/ Also not only the girls may get taken advantage of in the way you are hinting at. There have been male idols targeted for the same reason, but because they aren't women it seems to get swept under the rug or joked about.",-0.937,130

"The worst thing is that they do this with idols in order for them to become perfect in the eyes of fans and without exaggerating, they seem all robots of beautiful smiles and act the same. I want idols that are human beings, because that's what they are. I want to see my bias hanging out with her girlfriend at the mall. I want to see my bias by saying what she really thinks and if there is a curse, what's the problem? I also say. I want to be a fan of humans, not robots. Western artists have time to sleep and hang out with friends as well as time to work hard. And few fail. Why is the Kpop industry so demanding? Is training and being disciplined good? Yes. But everything that is too much hurts. Perhaps they even had a better psychological quality and more courage in the perfomances. When we are happy and well we can shine more. This is my Kpop look, from a person who is very far from this reality let's say so. I'm on the other side of the world, and I appreciate the Korean culture too much. There are so many people involved in Kpop, is it not possible that we can do something about it??",0.9627,240

You were definitely right about it being more difficult as a female idol or trainee. Females are expected to be tiny and we only get one meal a day while working on the same schedule as the males and it's really hard especially since the majority of us are pretty young. As a female trainee you aren't taken very seriously and it's very hard to get the attention you want from your managers or the people who overlook you. Your ideas are constantly overlooked or ignored and it's really frustrating tbh,-0.4286,94
