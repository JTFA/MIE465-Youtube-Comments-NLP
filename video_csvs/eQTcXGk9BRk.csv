"[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Verse 2]
The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own
 

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Outro]
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun",0.9574,286

"보이스의 색이 많고 음색이 훌륭하네요.^^

악기의 도움 없이 곡을 소화 잘 해내는 실력의 소유자^^

어색한 부분 없이 
노래를 휘감는 가수 군요^^

좋은데요^^

노랫말의 뜻은 잘 모르겠으나,
들려오는 느낌은 경쾌함에 조신함을 담아 
자신의 색을 잘 표현해 낸 곡과
노래 이었습니다^^

잘 들었습니다.

깨끗한 노래와 곡 이었습니다.
가창력 또한 대단한 가수일듯 한데요.^^
