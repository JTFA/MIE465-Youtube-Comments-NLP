"""I always thought moving around in a virtual world didn't make a lot of sense""

Surely it makes more sense to move navigate around a virtual space using your body rather than a controller (as in the case for video games).
Even just using a headset with a controller would be far more immersive than staring at a screen.

VR devices are just another form of immersion..
Possibly the most engaging way to experience things next to actually doing them. With the added ability to do them at home.

I don't see VR going away any time soon especially since there are more devices on the way to further immerse yourself in a given experience.",0.7841,125

"Good evening all! Hey I have a sciency (sciencey?) question for @SmarterEveryDay. When cooking on my stove tonight, I observed some very strange water behavior and would love to have some answers as to why the water in behaving the way that it was. I took ice-cold water and dropped it in a pan that was on medium heat, and it began forming weird bubbles under the lid. I literally created a youtube channel to ask this question. I can't upload a video as a part of my comment, so I posted it on my channel so you can see it for yourself. This is in no way trying to advertise for my channel or get you to subscribe (please don't- I don't post any content!) If you are a viewer reading this comment, can you do two things for me?
