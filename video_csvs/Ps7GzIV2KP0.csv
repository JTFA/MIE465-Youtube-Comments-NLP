"Crows belong to the group of birds called corvids, which include, but not limited to, crows, ravens, parrots and jays, ALL of which have phenomenal powers of memory, tool use and associational awareness to name a few. One Canadian college professor and some students caught and tagged several crows around campus while wearing caveman masks and then released them and didn't wear the mask again until several (I believe it was eight) years later. One day he wore the same mask and just walked around campus, not harassing ANY crows. They, including several birds that hadn't even been born yet at the time, started immediately to call out warning/predator calls upon seeing the mask. Parrots have also been shown to have tool use and bluejays can remember where up to 70% of the acorns they buried for winter where located months later.Basically, most social animals have higher intelligence than solitary, similar animals do is what was found in these studies.",0.8727,182

"TomTom Vlogs    if by that, you mean determining choices that will be the most beneficial to other creatures? sort of. i mean, again, depends on the animal.

pack-hunting animals like wolves and hyenas will share meat with the rest of the pack, as a means of benefiting the whole pack. 

but, some competitive solitary animals compete with or sometimes even fight other members of their species. but, this does help preserve the strongest gene in that species.


besides, it seems like some humans can't even tell ""right"" from ""wrong"".

*cough cough ajit pai cough cough*",0.9144,115
"TomTom Vlogs    you are wrong. you are just assuming things now. humans are animals, have all the traits of animals, and descended from animals. this has been proven by scientific means. many animals also, as demonstrated by this video, have similar intelligence to humans. just because humans are smart doesn't mean they can't be grouped in with dumber things.",0.0516,69

It isn’t fair, I believe we should be living in the wild like we were supposed to, but I can’t do anything about what the Homo Sapien have done. We will kill each other and go extinct because of it. It is inevitable. We are only going to destroy all life on Earth. And I’m pretty sure there is only life HERE. So if we all go, life is gone forever.",-0.7311,151
