"+oooSKYLIGHTooo - that's really interesting, I wish we knew more about that.

The one thing about this video that bugged me was the bit tagged on at the end that was ""hey, we know all the evidence here says Lucas had very little to do with the editing process on Star Wars, and all the editing we can safely attribute to him - i.e. Special Editions - is universally hated, but actually it was secretly his genius that saved the films all along!""

But then I probably go a little too far in the direction of ""George Lucas was a talentless hack and all the things that made Star Wars great came from other people or were forced on him by necessity""",0.2448,136

For me that's always been his greatest strength - not as a creative in his own right, but as allowing other creative people to shine.",0.7621,125

"I've long maintained that turning George Lucas into the god-like auteur of Star Wars was what ruined the prequels, and the kind of aggressive critique and re-edit present on A New Hope was certainly part of what was missing.  The fan edits show that editing from a fresh perspective can go a long way, but I also think that there's a lot of compromises Lucas had to make with the other creatives on the team which ended up making the original Star Wars a better film, arguments he would have won by default making the prequels simply because he was George Lucas.",0.4503,107

Also, they probably should've paced the movies differently, in order to show Obi-Wan actually training Anakin (""he was a pupil of mine..."") before them falling apart.
They could've had Obi-Wan going on some adventure of his own, maybe chasing down a criminal or whatever, in the first movie, stumbling upon this kid Anakin, who maybe helps him somehow, so he helps him back to win the pod race (and his and his mother's freedom), which should've been the finale (it works well as one).
We could see Obi-Wan training Anakin at the beginning of the second movie, and the two of them bond, and then have them go to Naboo to solve the crisis, protect the Queen and eventually have her lead her oppressed people in an uprising against the Trade Federation (or some other better written enemy). Darth Maul shows up and almost kills the Queen, the jedi confront him and Anakin kills him. Anakin and Padme fall in love.
Cut Count Dooku, who's pointless anyway. Cut Qui-Gon, or maybe give him a small part in an early sequence in Episode I, sort of like Indy's father in Last Crusade's intro. Palpatine's machination, which are redundant in the Prequels (he props up a foreign enemy to create a crisis to gain more power three times: with the Trade Federation and then with Dooku and then with Grievous, a bit repetitive), should stay largely in the background until Episode III, and our heroes should mostly learn about them through public news or hearsay, not because of boring assembly meetings.
And then come up with something creative for Episode III, possibly with Padme having to part from the children not immediately after they're born, as in Return of the Jedi Leia says she can kind of remember her.",0.5654,343
"JimPlaysGames
I was asking myself that very question, at least about the Phantom Menace. The way I see it, that movie has way to much stuff in it, and at least a couple of things should've been cut or probably just written differently. Jar Jar Binks aside, the main problem in the structure is that it ends with 4 finales at the same time: the jedi duel, the space battle with Anakin and the Naboo pilots, the ground battle with Gungans and droids and the queen's attempt to capture the Trade Federation leaders. That's 4 subplots, too many for the viewer to follow. Hope had 1 ending, Empire did, too (Cloud City), Jedi had 3 (space battle, forest and jedi duel), and it was already a bit confusing. I would've changed two things:
1) Qui-Gon should never have brought Anakin to Naboo, possibly not even to Coruscant, leaving him on Tatooine instead, for the time being. That would've allowed to cut the space battle, which is kind of pointless anyway since it's only there to prove Anaking is a gifted pilot, but we already know that from the pod race.
2) Cut the Gungans. Not because of Jar Jar, but because the movie shows them *instead of the people of Naboo* . Think about it. Aside from the queen's bodyguards, maidens and dignitaries, we're never shown any person from Naboo, any civilian. We're supposed to relate to their struggle, what with the embargo and the military occupation, but we're never shown a suffering Nabooan, just the court. Instead, we follow a cartoon rabbit to an underwater bubble city to the other side of the planet. Instead of a vital plot element, the embargo and the treaty or whatever actually making life harder for the people of Naboo, and the viewer feeling bad about it, we get to meet weird aliens who want nothing to do with it. That's the kind of stupid idea Lucas probably thought about reading his old comics, but which doesn't make sense in a movie. I say cut the Gungans and have Queen Amidala lead a rebellion of her own people against the Trade Federation instead, and we're down to 2 finales at the same time.
Jar Jar Binks could've been just some village idiot from Naboo (a human, that is) who helps hide the Queen or something.
I'm not sure how the duel with Darth Maul could've changed, and I'm not sure it makes sense anyway, but if it does it's in the context of the broader story, and to rethink that means rethinking the whole trilogy.

Just my 2 cents.",-0.9782,500

"Once again great video. As some of the other commentators have said. George Lucas is great with ideas, but he is horrendous at execution.

"Regarding the trench run - the 'joy of victory' is an important point, but I think it's far more important that the Death Star's approach to the rebel base creates tension during the scene. The audience is constantly aware of a ticking clock, and the tension builds throughout the scene to a nail-biting climax. Without this element, the scene would have been far less exciting. 

One small problem that always bothered me about the scene, but which makes more sense now, is that the timing of this ticking clock is off; at one point a voice over says either 'one minute and closing' or 'thirty seconds and closing' but the period then the battle continues for several minutes before the Death Star is in range. However, this is only a minor nitpick; overall, the ticking clock is the device which makes the scene.",-0.9577,163

"The movie would be better with the ""Luke with his friends/Biggs on Tatooine"" footage as it gives more emotional weight to the rebellion and Luke's place in it, what he wants to do, etc, and IS better with the Yavin 4 Biggs scene in the special edition, so you're wrong. Sorry about that. Also, the prequel trilogy is good, Marcia's influence is overstated, and Lucas is a noted editor in his own right, with people like John Milius having GL edit their films for them in college, Kasdan is a hack as evidenced by the Indy story conferences+TFA, and Star Wars is a good script, independent of any edit, with the original crawl not being a problem unless the intent is to maximize pandering to the Audience. Many sci-fi novels are more dense than that crawl in their introductory chapters.
Plus, you don't make it clear that Lucas didn't personally do/oversee the initial edit. (this is the worst part you disingenuous fuck)

"To some degree, yes. If you watch the making-of for the Phantom Menace , they knew the film had some huge problems off the assembly cut. There's amazing footage of Lucas looking really uncomfortable, and the producer also having this dead-eyed, ""oh my god what did we do"" look. I think part of the problem is Lucas likely asserted more overall power during the making of the prequels, partly by design and partly just by reputation at that point, which made it less of a truly collaborative process, and more of a top-down ""everything comes from George"" structure. What I also find strange is that Ben Burtt worked as a picture editor on all three prequels, and while he's probably the greatest sound designer in film history, I'm not particularly impressed with his work as a picture editor, at least if the final cuts reflect his actual work. I'd venture a guess that he was likely chosen because of a good creative rapport with Lucas (per his phenomenal sound work on all the films), but he might have ended up more of a ""yes man,"" or not had the ""editor's vision"" to really fight Lucas' script and presence to improve the films as much as possible through editing. On the other hand, the prequels are also just packed with a lot of more intellectual and abstract themes (like politics, etc. - which I don't think worked from a writing perspective) that to some degree chain the films to being a certain way. It's worth noting though that while the original Star Wars is genuinely a classic, it does have a lot of wooden performances that share a through-line with Lucas's prequels, so some of that may have been addressable in the prequel trilogy.",0.9708,330
