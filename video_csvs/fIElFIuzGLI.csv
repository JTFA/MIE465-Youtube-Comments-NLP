"Hi Kandee! I watched this when it first came out before the wave of negative comments and I have to say while watching I enjoyed your video SO MUCH. I did notice a couple of editing errors and laughed thinking ""poor kandee must have been hella tired while editing xD"". But it didnt bug me at all because honestly it feels like OG beauty videos!!!! You know, before ppl hoarded make up and it was simply a few girls playing with makeup, using their bed side lamps and web cams and being candid. 
I loved the familiarity. I wish we could go back to simple videos like that :/ 
Id love for all your videos to have those ""mistakes""",0.9522,133

I love u kandee and your videos made me love makeup so much more. You were the first mua I ever watched for a long time. I never even heard of most of these people till recently. I think with youtube cutting peoples pay or whatever some ppl are getting jealous and trying to down others and they just jumped on your mistake. I dont think its that big of a deal they are just ugly people on the inside with nothing better to do. Don't sweat it you are amazing and you can just tell you are sweet inside out.,0.6362,107

Every item I have bought myself has still been that same ol' cheap ass colourpop formula. I don't know. I just wish Kandee and other artists that I respect so much wouldn't fall in this rabbit hole.

Like seriously what can you do about the camera focusing on something else? Nothing because you can't help what the camera does, everything has a mind of it's own. These things happen and we learn from them and we try and try again until we get it right. You're an inspiration to so many kandee, so just ignore them all... because in the end we have other things to do in life and be happy and enjoy it because you never know what the next day brings.

You’re amazing Kandee!!!,0.5257,73
I’m so happy you spoke out about people being so mean. You are amazing and so positive. Who cares if you’re rushed and excited. Who cares what quality your camera is when you are just trying to help us to see a launch as soon as you can when you’re so busy! People need to appreciate your efforts to get things up when we all are busy and trying to manage life in general with the holidays and making sure to be with family. You’re the best. Don’t forget that you are loved by so many and negative people need to realize they should just keep their mouths shut.

"🍬💋🍬👄🍬💋🍬👄🍬💋🍬👄🍬❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Kandee beats any youtuber any second of the day in all the years she's been alive. Not only is she the OG, she is super talented and built herself from the ground UP. She is not only an amazing makeup artist that can do simple makeup, glam makeup, makeovers, but she can do character makeup like nobody's business. She is decent, doesn't have  a snotty or vicious bone in her body or snotty or vicious word in her vocabulary, she is REAL and isn't grotesquely vial like JS, and so many other YTubers out there, but she has built her brand from the ground up while raising 4 beautiful children as a single mama. Does anyone know what it's like to be a single mama? I do and it is no small measly task. We need MORE KANDEE'S in the world all day eraday because she is a light in the darkness of crazy perverted youtubers and Youtube watchers. I've watched her from the first video she's ever made on how to clean makeup brushes, she never curses, she has never been ""plastic"", she doesn't bash on anyone EVER, she does nothing but encourage encourage encourage and wants everyone to feel loved ""more than they know"" and she is not worthy of one single negative comment for this video. She's never stooped to the lowest of human indecency like so many other YTubers,, and she loves God (the best thing about her). So freaking what about the editing or whatever...it's just makeup and swatching. So many negative Nancy's in the world, y'all need therapy. I absolutely adore and ❤❤❤❤❤ you so much @kandeeJohnson you're the real deal mama!",0.1749,331
