"Hi, I’m Jon Stehle, photographer, videographer, and aspiring filmmaker-pastor. This past semester dealt a strong blow to me that made me realize just how weak I was in some areas and where my full strength and potential laid in others. In order to continue my efforts at Liberty University to earn a Masters of Divinity, I’ve found that I’ve had to take a job, far from my home of Texas, in Illinois. I am for the most part able to cover my rent there but am having difficulty paying for the trip up (U-Haul, gas, current rental contract). I’m estimating being $1,100 short and would appreciate if anyone can help me with my cause. I want to make movies that entertain people and honor God and I have a small roadblock to go to accomplish that. Thank you for what you can give. Give me your name and I will credit you in the next film I make... which will be my first. Thank you for your time. -Jon Stehle
