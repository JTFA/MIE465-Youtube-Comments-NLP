All of this dont mean anything i support these spurs and I don't want leonard to play another game this season there's no point. This team has zero chance to beat gsw in a series i dont even want them to make the playoffs becuz they capable of knocking out houston or okc and i dont want them doing that becuz those 2 teams have a small chance to beat the warriors in a series i need Houston and okc to play the warriors both of them,0.6458,88

"Bro how come no one is talking about the 1st draft pick Markelle Fultz, someone in the 76ers org. Fucked with his shot and now he is hands down the saddest story in the NBA I feel so bad for that 19 yr. Old kid with the pressure and weight of the world and all eyes on him as totally lost all confidence in his shot. Why would the 1st pick who had extraordinary numbers and percentages in college all of the sudden change his shot. And right after he got picked by the 76ers and started practicing with them. They tweaked his shot and ruined that kid. That trainer should be fired. All these personal trainers need to be fired. They are limiting these athletes talents. Because they can only teach them what their body can do or what they know. Where is the past veteran's that worked for this organizations to teach them new moves, their foot work, to drive n slam not step back floaters.

"Here's what's going on. Kawhi is not a villain, neither are the Spurs. The problem is one or two guys dropped the ball when it came to his ankle and leg. They either didn't listen to where Kawhi said it hurt, or whatever treatment or surgery made him feel worse, and they said just like Doctors do, ""oh dont worry once the swelling goes down you'll be good."" Listen Kawhis injury is difficult to treat. The doctors were probably just using the rice method instead of taking into account the fact that he had leg and knee problems, along with two back to back same broken ankle. It wasn't even fully healed the first time. He's probably waking up in pain in the morning, and developing bone spurs and arthritis in that ankle. I've tried walking and playing sports on a bad ankle. Its not good now. 

Bottom Line: Kawhi is now feeling different on that ankle and knee. He's realizing that he was accidently mistreated by Doctors who thought it was just a bad ankle sprain. He's will be able to perform even with all the scar tissue and arthritis but he'll be in a lot of pain after every game. I feel like he's ticked off that he will forever have this bum ankle thanks to Spurs ""Doctors"". He wants out of San Antonio. If he ends up with the Warriors, Cavs, Boston, Rockets, Blazers, Raptors, or Thunder it might be trouble for everyone else.",-0.9402,280

Just watch his off season old documentary and you would have seen how much a championship consumed him so was easy to see he'd go to the Warriors. I also called Westbrook averaging a triple double, said it the second K.D signed to the Warriors, said with him gone Russ will easily average a triple double and get MVP, cus he just is that firey.

"Kawhi and PG13 coming to the Lakers this summer. Lakers trade Kuzma, Hart, and a 1st rounder for Kawhi. Both Kuzma and Hart fit into the Spurs type of system. They're young developing players who can contribute right away, but also have Superstar potential in the coming years. Both are on Rookie contracts for 2 more seasons, allowing the Spurs a ton of cap flexibility. This is why the trade makes sense for the Spurs. For the Lakers it makes sense to lose Kuzma, maybe you best asset honestly, for Kawhi because that means you're almost certainly getting PG13.
