"*EXPLANATION* *Here's the explanation for this film and the other Cloverfields films. I found this explanation on another site and its very very accurate for those that don't understand how it connects to the other Cloverfield movies*

*""This movie is probably set in the future, but the impact of activating Shepard caused monsters to arrive at all points along that timeline. Which in itself means that infinite universes were likely created from each moment in time, and the original movie was basically a snapshot of that moment in that timeline where monsters were just inserted into that reality - as a result of the Shepard activation that hapened further down the same timeline, but in the future.

It kind of was a prequel, but it happened in the future, and the actions of the crew affected all moments in that timeline, including in the past (first cloverfield movie), present (this movie) and probably future ... if that makes sense.""*",0.5499,182

Baseline for the ARG is a Japanese company digs for oil and makes food. The food may have used parts from the monster in the first movie, and a lot of other convoluted stuff. 

There's going to be a cloverfield 4, supposedly set in WWII, and the Japanese company was formed in 1945 in the ARG. 

I think that these movies dont make too mice sense at the moment, but once they are all made, then they may name more sense. Who knows.

"its a very good movie that , yes - spoilers ahead -  brings a totaly unique explanation as to what the creature is, where it is from or how it got on earth  - and all of that multi dimensional chaos occuring , is both brilliant , well executed and even funny at times, - never seen a man be so positive about losing his arm, finding it 10 mins later, alive and crawling around the deck. But if your expecting to see giant monsters - you will only see the cloverfield monster at the last 10 seconds orso - but this monster is MASSIVE !!! if you can put your head and shoulders above the clouds, - than you are the size of cities... so in a way this movie reveals what happenend prior to the Cloverfield and how the monster ended up on earth,  and it also shows IN A WAY what happenens to earth after cloverfield movie - and one can assume that the earth these 2 paradox survivors go back to,  is a good approximation of the future the other earth will have, with a version of the monster appearing somewhere in the year 2000 something. 

 when her husband yells , with those ""things"" on the planet ?  then you know, humanity is sharing the earth with extra dimensional giant alien monster,  so the monster ended up on earth in the year 2000's because of this teams Shepard experiment ( Mass effect xD ) to save a future earth from dying...  unclear is rather these cosmonaughts are from an alternate version of the earth as compared to the one we know in Cloverfield movie - or if they are from the cloverfield universe, but set in the future , and that by doing the shepard experiment,  they created a bunch of alternate realities, - including seperating their past world from the one they currently  know ( kinda like Star Trek 2009 i think, )",0.983,352
