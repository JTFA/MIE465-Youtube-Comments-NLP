1. It was more of a playlist than an album. I get it, but I said this before drake is not a good singer.

 has he have Jamaican in his blood; he's Jewish. Controlla was very average, catchy but average.

1. the beats were horrible and not well mixed.

3. the collabs were very odd and off putting. I make an exception for Alicia keys because she showed out, but the others NEEDED TO GO.

4. Revival is a disjointed, uneven project due to the slim shady tendencies. He goes from talking about his life to making songs about people eating his turds and women with thick asses like wtf? some of the subject matter was recycled from MMLP2 and I definitely don't want to feel like I'm hearing the same album twice.",-0.6033,155

"I’ve always followed Charlamagne and used to listen to him back when he was on the radio in Columbia. I like how he is outspoken and doesn’t hold anything back. However, when it comes to music, it seems like he’s always following the popular belief. The biggest reference I can relate to is Eminem at the BET cypher. He got on the Breakfast Club and said Eminem’s freestyle was great. Then the next day on social media, kids started trashing it saying that they like the message but the freestyle was trash. The very next day Charlamagne got on the Breakfast club and said after listening to Eminem’s freestyle carefully, it was only ok. He said he like the message but the bars were just ok, nothing great about it. So, that should tell you that he obviously is just following what everyone started saying or he didn’t even listen to it the first time so he shouldn’t have commented on it that Monday morning.",0.9786,194

"This was entertaining as hell, but I hated seeing how they talked about Logics biracial issues. My niggas came off ignorant and took it light hearted. My girl is biracial and she had a lot of issues growing up with that. In a society you're either one or the other, and depending on your personality and how you look they go just put you as black or white, but you're actually both. J Cole gets a ""pass"" because he identifies as black and looks black for the most part. But Logic is just as black and white as Cole. Just because he doesnt look it doesn't mean that. The nigga doesn't have to pick a side.  What if you like country and your favorite show is Friends and Seinfield and your favorite artist is Carrie Underwood? You automatically white? What if you like hip hop and your favorite show Martin and your favorite artist Aaliyah? You black then? What if you like Martin and Seinfield, and you like Aaliyah and Carrie Underwood? Wtf are you then? That's the issues they had. 

 Certain people are genuinely confused about what the fuck they are because of society norms. I agree, Logic did preach too much on Everybody, but overall it was still a pretty good project. Not album of the year quality, but it's a lot of other worse shit. But to say he didn't have any problems growing up just because he looks white is stupid as fuck, especially hearing it from these two. They both are usually good with that. He experienced a lot of issues mentally I'm sure. The nigga ain't even 30 yet, he is just now really realizing who he is as a person. I get it. He is overly positive, and he preached that Maclemore 2013 2014 positive vibes agenda. But don't shit on a nigga for being positive ad figuring out what and who he is.",0.9777,358

"This year's mainstream logic in rap  is ""pro-black"" = hate cops & fuck trump; shit I don't even care about.

Smh How are you going to expand a culture when it's being marginally pushed to only a select few. wtf. This isolationism is the reason why trap is increasingly becoming the centerpiece or face of hip hop rn.  lol
Fuck. Hip hop is really dead; Again. I'm done listening to it. Tired of being pushed into the same thought box everyday in the life. All these delusions of persecutions (That's how trump got southern votes). It's like living in your own prison or within someone elses reality. From 2008 up to mid 2ks, Drake & Kanye even Joe got me OUT! of that prison. Because of that idealistic freedom, i'm now doing too well right now, and i'm not letting you mofos put me back in. Not going to isolate my self because of the color of my skin. I just do not understand your 'struggles'. There is just too much for a person with dark skin can do in this universe.
You say you don't care about the grammies, but it looks like all this shit and steam is stemming off passively against the grammies. You aint free minded my niggah. 
I realize this aint really about the culture. If this continues, see you guys in another 7 to 8 years then. Maybe a dem will win with the help of extreme identity politics, and yall niggas can finally forget about who ever the fuck is in the white house. lol. Deuces.
