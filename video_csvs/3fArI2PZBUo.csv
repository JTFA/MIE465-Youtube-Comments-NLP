"gorillawarfair Interesting, I was finding conflicting accounts from different people/organizations.",0.0,14
"gorillawarfair actually only a few corgis out of many are born with naturally short tail, it's a recessive gene. While I think it's rude to immediately call someone a monster without knowing anything of the background, or if the tail is actually docked, I believe it's much ruder to call someone an 'ignorant fuck' when you yourself don't seem to have much knowledge of the breed.",-0.8934,73
