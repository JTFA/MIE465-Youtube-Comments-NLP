Christianity, they had the Catholic church, as a representation of Christianity!  I tell you the truth, there is a very big difference between Christianity and being under the Catholic ideology.

It is sad and funny at the same time, that so many believers would not pick-up their Bible to see for themselves that it is Catholic ideology that goes against the Bible.  Jesus said, ""call no man your father on earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven"".

So, in disdain, they call the pope, heavenly father. God said in,  Leviticus 26:1   ""Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God"".
