Immigrants are literally replacing the descendants of slaves in America without a chance at reparations.

She looks rough for only promoting 1 track.. Yall gotta stop promoting these girls who are not cut out for this business. Blue Ivy was like #TeamFifthHarmony. They should have gotten a grammy for their newest album. It was the most cohesive album to come out last year. Every song was good all the girls got parts. All I know is as soon as this chick left the group is when they were able to do some really good music. They had a couple hits here & there before but this past album was special. I personally have never liked Camilla or whatever. Ever since the show in which Demi Lovato remarked on Camilla standing out. I can't remember if Demi had gotten sober yet but either way that girl doesn't have the best judge of character. The big thing that is going on right now is these producers/label execs are not trying to put music out there for woman. They like the government only see white men as a solution which is BS. So I hope a lot of these ladies realize that instead of competing they need to come together & take the industry back so they can make it better.,0.9459,219
