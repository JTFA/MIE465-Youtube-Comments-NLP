"(Tears Pouring)  So sorry for ur loss too!  Ur doing a great job from what I can tell, keep ur Father's memory alive.  I loss my Mom 3/29/16 and I live in the house where she died, w/me holding her up, while she vomited and couldn't breathe because her brain was hemorrhaging.  She was my Mother & my Father, so it's like lossing both parents at once.  There was no warning this was going to happen, but she wanted to go because she was in so much back pain, plus broke both hips, so she needed assistance in everything she did, which in her opinion was no type of life, and i agree.  I selfishly want her back, but only if I could have her totally healthy & happy.  I'm glad she's no longer in pain, but I miss her unbelievably.  To honor her I had the opportunity to go to her country that she was born in, Japan, to witness my 2nd Grandson being born.  I do believe that some how my Mom was watching over Henry, because he had the cord wrapped around his neck and it was a very scary & painful delivery, but in the end, we had a sweet baby boy on 8/20/17.  I had SO MUCH fun seeing the beaches that she talked about, with clean, clear water, i ate the food there, saw all the sites, and best of all, I got to be with my daughter/best friend, who my Mother loved so much too.  Whitney, just keep doing your best for family & your Mom, I think that would make your Dad happy & proud. 💜",0.9933,319

"All I did was cry cry cry. You described my dad. I lost him 6 years ago and I'm missing him all the time. The last year the crying got worse, don't know why. I have a 3 and 1 year old, and I feel exactly the same towards my mother. Wish she had my father to enjoy this journey with. 

You're doing such a great job at being a mother. I want to thank you for making my insecurities ""normal"".",-0.8402,93

"Awe! Whitney, this breaks my heart! I was very close to my grandpa (my dads dad) who we lost when I was 4 months pregnant with our daughter Zoe who is now 9 years old. It was so hard! It’s still hard! We still tell her to this day that her grandpa got to meet her before we did and he sent her to us! He is her guardian angel! Every time I talk about him I get tears in my eyes because I want him so bad to be here with my grandma and enjoying his great grandchildren but he’s not and all we can do is tell our children about him, stories, photos, memories. We have now added to our family and have a 5 month old son named Zander. We lost my moms dad 2 weeks after we had our son. It’s crazy how things changes as we get older and you think that it will get easier and it doesn’t. Talk about him often the good and the bad (if their was any) and remember that they are still here with you even though you can’t see them. (Not in a creepy way! ;) lol",0.4706,231
"Aww Whitney I’m so sorry for your loss.  You’re dad sounds like he was an amazing man, and I’m sure he’s looking down on you and is so proud.  Also, the way Sonny stares up at you at the end of the video is the sweetest thing 😍",0.8608,60

It's all the love you want to give but cannot. All of that unspent love gathers up in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and in the hollow part of your chest. Grief is love with no place to go.""",0.9404,89

Everything you said is how I feel.  I lost my dad 4 years ago to stage 4 lung cancer (non smoker) it was a surprised to all of us.  A year ago I had my baby boy and I do feel like special events like his first birthday or Baptism would be a lot different if he were still here.  I try not to be negative and just think how lucky he is to grow up with his grandma so close.  I never grew up with grandparents because they lived in another country so its nice to see him so excited to see grandma.  At home I just tell him who grandpa was and show him pictures.,0.9168,125

"Hi Whitney. I'm so sorry you're family is without your dad, he sounds like an amazing man. My husband I lost his cousin, 2 years ago this week too breast cancer, she was only 39 and left behind a husband and 5yo son. Her name was Tina and she incredible. Simular to your dad, she would make everyone feel comfortable around her, and even to her dying day was so positive and thankful for the life she did have. Knowing she was terminal, they went to a lot of counsellors to learn how to cope leading up to her death and afterwards, and the common thread was communicate the truth in a language a 5yo can understand, and always talk. We continue to talk about her all the time, share facebook memories as they come up and tag her husband in the photos so he can see her memory isn't lost and that people haven't forgotten about her. Talking about her honours her memory, sometimes it's sad, but it feels good to remember her, talk about her, and ask, ""what would Tina do?"" 

I love your idea to have the photos of your dad for Sonny. It'll be good for him and for you. Thank you for sharing and being vulnerable. I don't normally comment (I've never done so before) but I just wanted to thank you. X",0.9813,258

The best thing is to put pictures up in your home.  Show Sonny everyday and talk about your dad. My girls met my dad but they were only 9 and 6 when he passed. My family lives in Hawaii, so they were only able to talk to him on the phone and visit every couple of years. I miss him something terrible, and still have days of crying.  Hugs to you.",-0.7046,123

"I lost my aunt earlier this year, it was the first time I had huge grief unexpected grief. lost grandparents which I was incredibly upset by years before but this was different. You know grandparents will pass as they are in the end of their long lives- still sad but you just seem to know that's how it goes. I saw a psychologist to counsel me over the grief. I did exactly what you said allow yourself to cry and the moments happen less too but def still intense as you said too Whitney. I turned my grief into things that I knew both my Aunt and I had in common, we both love to paint and collect shells decided to do more of this for my own joy but also because its something my Aunt loved. The significant point that helped my grief was slowing down enough to recognise the things I love (painting and shells) is also what my Aunt loved I took a day by the river collecting shells and looking at the beauty of the scenery. It gave me peace that whilst my Aunt is gone, what she loves is always here for me to do and still keep that sense and memory of her.",0.9764,223

It has been a roller coaster of 2.5years. I couldnt click this video fast enough, he would be proud of you for making it and more. I found my daughters 1st birthday hard to face, her birth was the most wonderful home birth i could have ever wished for but like you say those moments are so bitter sweet. I cant put in to words how it felt to be up in the night ( she was born 11.04pm) with this amazing little baby that completed our family, while feeling like my family was in pieces with such a huge unexpected loss. Like your dad, my dad was as i always describe him, golden, like noone else ive ever met. There was simply nothing anyone didnt like about him. Im so so proud that he was my dad and im sure you feel the same about yours. x",0.986,205

I'm so glad you did this chapter. I am going through the same thing. I had my son in April and when I had him I cried in the hospital bc I kept seeing my daddy in my son's face. It hit me so hard!!! My daddy died suddenly of heart attack 7 years ago and also missed our wedding. I feel the same way you do and now I don't feel so alone in these feelings. It's so hard sometimes bc you know how much better it would be if they were here to enjoy our sons. I used my maiden name as his middle name to honor my dad.

I’m not at a place yet where I can keep photos of my Dad around, but he was awesome (just like your dad!) When it gets hard, I try to remind myself how lucky I am to have had such an amazing dad. I’m sure you feel similarly about your own! Much love to your family!! <3",0.988,102

Sadly my amazing partner's farther past away when he was a teenager. I know he's felt sad during those huge moments in life when his dad's not been here to see what's going on. We named our son after his Dad to honour him. We talk about grandpa all the time and say he's in heaven watching up everyday. We have photos in the boys room and we try to tell as many stories as we can. I never got to meet him but I feel like I knew him from everything I've heard xx,0.7814,100
"Seriously Whitney you guys did an amazing job on this video, it seemed therapeutic. it's my favorite one so far, a touching montage and made me emotional.

"Thank you Whitney for this video. I’m so sorry for the loss of your dad. It’s so hard to lose a parent. They’re your rock, your guide and your best friend. I know you miss him dearly. He will be with you always. 

I lost my mom to a rare bile duct cancer a year ago. She passed away 10 days before her birthday. She was so young, 60 years old. I remember her speaking with the hospital Chaplin saying she wasn’t afraid to die, but that she wanted to see her grandson, (my son was 2 at the time) grow up. And to live life with her family. She was an amazing person! Everyone loved her and she had so many friends. 

Thank you for making this video. I was due for a good cry. 

And thank you for being raw and honest. Please keep making them. We love the updates and topics. 💗💖💜❤️",0.9879,191
"Thank you for making this video, im sorry for your loss, and I understand completely how hard it is to loose a dad. Mine past away four years ago with respiratory failure due to Aids. I had a difficult relationship with him, but most of my memories growing up of him are happy ones. I just had my first baby seven weeks ago, a boy. When I look deep into My son's eyes and he is looking back at me sometimes I feel my dad looking back at me. My son and I will smile at each other and tears come to eyes because somehow through my son I feel and see my dad. It's precious, and joyful and sad all at the same time. I know my dad would be so excited about my son, and he would be so proud of me, your dad would be very proud of you too. Thank you again for sharing your heart.",0.9886,176
"Thank you for sharing such a touching story with us, i know it was very hard for you. Seeing you hold your baby while crying and talking about your father made me think, “wow what a strong mother, daughter and wife she is”. I have a 2 month old and i lost my mother about a year and a half ago. I know exactly what you mean about you feeling like it was bittersweet, the day i had my son i kept thinking my mother was going to come in to the room. I waited all day for her to come.. i feel like I’m still waiting for her to come see him or call. I keep a lot of pictures of her around and i talk about her to him when i go through or pass by her pictures. I think that’s the best thing to do, is to let them know how great and loving your parents were and how they would have been with them. At least it’s what i think is best. I love watching your videos because i feel like i am not alone in how i am feeling after i had my son. Thank you once again for sharing that with us.",0.9894,232
"Thank you for sharing your story. I have lost my father 3.5 years ago from a lung cancer. After 8 months of treatment, he past away when my son was 4.5 months. I will always remember that moment. I was breastfeeding my son and had to continue being normal with him and my niece. It was so hard. Then I gave birth to my daughter 16 months after my son. Their love is so healing eventhough I still feel that huge emptiness in my heart in the hardest moments. I still cry, quite often and miss him so so much. I guess we just have to learn how to live with it and continue to talk about him to our children.",-0.5618,133
"Thank you for sharing. I recently lost my Grandma and we were very close. I miss talking to her everyday. I also named my son after my grandpa his name was Truman.

We can be so thankful for the memories we have of the people we love to cherish forever! XOXO",0.9852,87

"Thank you so much for sharing this Whitney. I have a beautiful 10 week old boy and we lost my dad suddenly when I was just 2 weeks postpartum. It has been such an intense time full of so much joy for my baby and so much pain for the loss of my dad. I’ve been listening to all his favorite music and singing and dancing to it with the baby. I’ve already started telling my son stories about my dad and all the special times we had together, and I plan to continue this so that he knows about him. Thanks for your willingness to share and for your ability to articulate your experience so well.",0.9706,128
"Thank you so much for sharing this video with us.  I couldn't agree more. The grief is still just as deep, but it just comes less often over time. My family lost our aunt to breast cancer 3 1/2 years ago. She was so loving, lit up any room she set foot in, and made each one of her nieces and nephews feel so loved (there are over 20 of us!). Every year we celebrate her birthday & the anniversary of her passing with her kids. Many of us also set up altars for her during Dia de Los Muertos to honor her. I think your dad would agree that you are an awesome mom and he'd be so proud of all the support people get from your videos. Sending you lots of love <3",0.9919,149

This has been the most poignant video I've seen! Thank you for sharing this. Today would've been my dad's 63rd birthday. He passed away in 2006 after 14 months of battling kidney cancer. Since then he has missed out on the births of his 4 grandkids and other milestones. It's been almost 11 years since he died and I'm still healing and processing the pain I feel from not having him around. Much love to you and yours!,-0.7707,85
"This hit way too close to home. My father in law died unexpectedly the year before my 7 yr old son was born. At the beginning when Freddy was a newborn I carried a lot of grief w me. As he got older I started having more and more resentment, especially towards friends who would complain about their own parents, etc. As time went on that resentment subsided bc I realized that everyone has some sort of grief. My husband and I from the start introduced his awesome Dad to our son through pictures and words. Now at age 7 our son knows who Grandpa Floyd is and what kind of man he was. Yes we still get sad bc he would have been the best grandfather but when I see my sons hair curl up JUST like his grandfathers I am reminded that he lives on in his grandson.",-0.0817,160
This i can relate to. I lost my dad to COPD 5 years ago and my son was nearly 2 years old. He doesn’t remember my dad and that breaks my heart. My daughter was born after and he never got to hold her. All my dad wanted was to stay and watch my son grow and he didn’t get that opportunity. I miss him every day.,-0.0258,77

We have pictures of my dad all around the house, it’s comforting to me. I also had some of his ashes made into a piece of jewelry I wear everyday which makes me feel like I have him with me all the time so he isn’t missing out on my life. I cried with you during this, I think we all needed a good cry. It’s definitely not the same, but it helps. ❤️",0.6311,136

My uncle Mike suddenly died a few years back and I was thinking of him and crying from the grief that I don't think I've quite dealt with yet. I'm 20 and don't have kids yet, but I think of all the qualities that he had and hope to instill those in my future children. Many of the qualities that you listed about your dad were a part of my uncle too. One of the warmest, funniest, loving people on the planet. The world needs more people like that. Thank you for being so transparent. Little Sonny is the cutest and I'm sure he'll grow up to be a mini Mr. Port; even though I don't personally know you and your family, I can see the humble, honest, loving people that you are.",0.9907,173

"We honored my daughters one year angelversary by having a butterfly release. We speak her name everyday to her son who will be celebrating his third birthday 11/14, his second birthday without his mommy. We have pictures all over so we can all see her beautiful smile and he recognizes her. His memories of her in life have faded, which is absolutely heartbreaking. Her baby boy will know all about his amazing mommy, Grammy will make sure of that. Some days it feels impossible to breathe without my sweet baby girl, tears flow daily.

"Whit, i lost my mom 4 years after she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She was 49 years old & i was married for three months. We found out the month after she passed we were expecting. (I’m crying typing this) there’s not a day that goes by that i miss her, & that i wish she could experience Blake with us. (Blake Shelton was her favorite. So we named our son after him!) for me, I’m going to make it a point to tell him everything about her. & to honor her memory to the fullest. It hasn’t gotten easy. With every new milestone is another, “i wish she were here” thank you so much for this video. We can help each other out ;-)",0.8622,154
Whitney Port thank you for sharing your story. I’ve been following with my 3 month old daughter and I appreciate your honesty and open mind. My husbands mother past away a few years ago and I know that it’s hard for him to not have her around to share in these moments. Your words give me insight into what he may be thinking and feeling. What are some ways that you find that your husband can do to support you with the memory of your father?,0.9349,95
Whitney and Timmy I couldn't hear anything!!!!!!! And I really wanted to watch it because I lost my dad too Whitney and I miss him everyday!,-0.6209,30
Whitney i can 100% relate to you on this. My dad died unexpectedly 7 years ago of heart issues at the age of 51. He died before he could walk me down the aisle. At least my husband got the chance to ask his permission for my hand in marriage.  2 1/2 years ago i had my son and i miss that he never got around to meet to meet his grandson. My son takes after my dad in so many ways. Which makes me miss him even more. My son also has my fathers first name as his middle name. Anthony Edward. Hugs to you Whitney 💜,-0.25,118

"Whitney, I saw the title of this pop up and I was already in tears. I lost my dad suddenly the day before my baby shower and 2 weeks before Christmas in 2012. I was 30 weeks pregnant with my first child, a girl. What was supposed to be the happiest time of my life became the worst. I was overwhelmed with grief, in shock, trying to prepare for my daughter's arrival, finishing the nursery, and I was just numb and didn't know what to do and cried every day. 8 weeks later I gave birth, being a first time mom was already so challenging and to add on the grief was crushing. I miss him everyday, I was so close with him much like you were with your dad.  I'm sad for my daughters to not have him as a grandpa. He was so excited to be a grandpa and I wanted to see him in that role because he was already an amazing dad. All of the grief came back when I became pregnant with my second daughter. You described it perfectly, every happy moment is also tinged with sadness because we miss our dads and the grief comes and goes. Sometimes you are prepared for it and other times it's random. My daughters are 4.5 yrs old and 5 months...but once they're older I plan to show them pictures and share stories of their grandpa. And to honor my dad, my second daughter's middle name is Jacklyn, he went by Jack. You are doing a great job as a momma and your dad would be so proud of you. <3",0.6931,301

Every moment is bittersweet but my son filled that void that I never thought would be fulfilled. I honor my grandma by being a strong advocate for Alzheimer's awareness and honestly I talk about her all the time. My son will know my grandma and how much she means to me.
