"America has become a society of mindless sheep. Instead of paying attention to the things that matter, like the fact that millions of our people are in prison for non-violent drug offenses and the IRS stealing our money every year and calling it ""taxes,"" people focus on the hottest new rap songs, Kylie Jenner having a baby, and the Eagles winning the Super Bowl. Society needs to wake up and smell the roses. We can distract ourselves with social media and mindless entertainment, but it doesn't change the fact that we're all getting fucked over by the corrupt people we put in office. It's time for a revolution. The Founding Fathers told us that if the US government ever became to us what Great Britain was to them, the American people had a right and duty to overthrow and replace their government with something new. We're long over due for that change. It's time for a revolution. If all of the 400K people who viewed this video marched on Washington and demanded change, we'd get it.

It is that unbelievable that spacex has accomplished this. You are witnessing the height of capitalism - private industry putting the best of the best to a goal- and winning. Reminds us all that we are capable of doing anything we dream so long as we have the right environment to do so. Imagine that. Telling a 11 year old Elon musk that he would send his electric roadster manufactured by his car company into orbit around the sun on the back of a rocket built by his space company. It's beyond surreal. This is why America must conserve the fundamental principles on which it was built. Because unfortunately- not everyone can do this.
