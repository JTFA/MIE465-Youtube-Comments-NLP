@KidRock @FLAGALine played the Country Explosion festival without PAY cause they did not want there fans effected by the venue's promoter! @RandyHouser played OUTDOORS through a bigger storm at Toadlick Festival for his fans! Kid cant do an indoor show at Mohegan because he wont walk through a lil wind to get to the building (an indoor city essentially) after all his gear is ready and fans emptied there wallets and turned there lives upside down to get there! dude wont even do meet & greets for fans ... its all a HUGE telltail to me that he's a privileged POS who feels nothing for those who put him where he is...,0.9639,118

"Fuck Kid Rock
My girl and I spent over $900 on tickets to see him at Mohegan Sun last night, paid $500 for a hotel too. And Bitch Rock's private jet couldn't take off from Louisville because of the storm. 
Well, fuck him; he should've flown in the day before yesterday or, since he's so fucking down to earth-like, he should've been traveling on the bus with his band. Foreigner played at Foxwoods last night - they made it.
When a snowstorm travel ban caused Mohegan Sun to cancel Bon Jovi's concert, the band was already there and played a free show for the 2000 fans who already had traveled there. 1000 Horses was already set up to open for Kid Rock, and could've played too - according to your roadies - fuck them too.",-0.8519,150

"Huh? Kid this ISN'T American Rock & Roll it's more melodic elevator country music. I LOVE Kid 🤘and seen him live 8x an he brings it every time! BUT since the Born Free Album his subsequent releasees have gotten further from ""Last Name"" to more melodic Countrified sound..which is obviously ok for many and he certainly doesn't need my/anyone's blessin as he's always stated his musical roots are MANY: Rock, Rap, Country, Gospel, R&B, Metal, Hip Hop, etc..and certainly an artist of his caliber/talent can't be expected to be pigeonholed musically...but I gotta be honest I can't name one song from his last 4 albums aside from the title tracks ...and I'd take Midnight Train to Memphis (MTM) over this song ANY DAY ..and not because  MTM encapsulates his 3 Main Music Styles (Country, Rap & Rock..in that order) ...but because it's just a BETTER written song. Play any song from Rebel Soul, First Kiss and (now this Album) and they're interchangeable and (sigh) ...can pass for any run-of-the-mill ""contemporary country"" which tho' hugely popular doesn't infact = quality (*SEE BELOW). Personally I think Kid Rock is BETTER than that. there's a reason why when Kenny Chesney (or any such clone) play Kid Rock's 'Cowboy' live at their own concerts the audience goes Bananas!! ...cuz it's simply a GREAT song! ....look I'm still a fan of Kid and will purchase tIx to see him LIVE whenever he's in town..I'll just have to hope he adds a lil more ""TALLICA"" Power Chords & NWA/Cube prose to his subsequent releases... and if he keeps it Country hope he adds more SKYNYRD to it and LESS Dirks Bentley& Lady Antebellum 😐....cuz gimmie some Trucker Anthem, Prodigal Son, Jackson Mississippi  Do It For You, Lay it on me, Only God Knows.., Black Chick/White Guy and of course Midnight Train to Memphis ANY DAY of the week!

"Midnight riding in my old two seater rolling down the boulevard
Headlights shining on rusty fences as I pass the rail yard
Black leather jacket on a Friday night
Fire up the lighter and a Lucky Strike
The radio's saying ""take a walk on the wild side""
And it's got me feeling like
Oh oh oh oh 
Go wide open it's a pedal down kind of a thing
Little bit of Motown smooth
A little bit of Memphis Blues
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll
I can see the banner on the courthouse flying proud red, white, and blue
I can see her waiving on the corner smiling cause she feels just like I do
Now she's sitting right next to me
Everything's how it oughta be
Being young in the land of the free
And she's got me feeling like
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Go wide open it's a pedal down kind of a thing
A little bit of Folsom Blues
A little bit of gangster smooth
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll
Midnight riding in my old two seater rolling down the boulevard
Headlights shining on rusty fences as I pass the rail yard
Oh oh oh oh 
And it's got me feeling like
Oh oh oh oh 
Hey yeah 
Go wide open it's a pedal down kind of a thing
A little bit of Delta Blues
A little Blue Suede Shoes
A sea of emotion raining all over me (oh oh oh)
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll
Oh oh American rock 'n roll
Oh oh American rock 'n roll
