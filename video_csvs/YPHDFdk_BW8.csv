"Getting sick of actors being fired over allegations that may not be true. Several have been from Netflix, makes me wonder if cable companies are trying to get rid of Netflix to get their customers back. If that's the case it's not going to happen in my house. I'm done with cable for life. I hope the the accusers are sued if the facts are false. I was raped by a stranger and I didn't wait 12 years to prosecute the man, that's why I believe all these accusers are paid off by someone to do this.",-0.9278,105
"Great!  Yet ANOTHER fine television program destroyed all for the pandering to a bunch of women who cried ""Sexual ASSAULT/RAPE!""  What a bunch of bullshit.  America USED to have ""innocent until PROVEN guilty"" but NOWADAYS?  Shee-IT!  All some Twat has to do is ALLEGE that you may or may not have acted in some way ""inappropriately,"" and POOF!  Your life, career, and self-respect disappear like a fart in the wind!  I know that if I weren't a broke piece of shit with no cash that SOME broad from MY past would leap forward now, puffed up with righteousness and self-indignation!  It's all about the CASH and the 15 minutes of fame.  Hell, Danny Masterson was never convicted for these alleged ""crimes!""  Did a Grand Jury even indict him?!?!  I hope that all of the women making these lies propagate in our society DO get some properly deserved, Karma bringing events tossed their way.  Perhaps some guys will find one or more of them and REALLY show them what the word ""rape"" means; Central Park Jogger style!  (Yeah, I'm old enough to remember that)  Frak...The Ranch was a great show, and Danny Masterson is a fine comedic actor.  Gone...all for the whining of women, something they are all wont to do!",-0.5588,256

Sad thing is once this is proven false his career is over and nothing will be done to the ladies who have got him fired from the show. Now if proven false he should sue the life out of the women un-do-stress and loss of income due to false accusations.,-0.8834,52

"matt2244 Actually, they said there was not enough evidence against Johnson to charge him when his 17 year old accuser reported him to police in 2013. However, the case was reopened by police recently. This is when Johnson took his life. If there was no crime (according to RAINN, who uses stats from the Justice Dept., only 3% of all people accused of sexual assault ever face prison time), and so few people are even charged, it makes no sense whatsoever for him to take his own life. Johnson was a State Representative for Kentucky, not a senator, and he has been in trouble politically before for posting racist memes.",-0.9652,128
"matt2244 Apparently there was a great deal of evidence brought forward, and one investigation has been going on for nearly a year. The  Church of Scientology has tried to intervene by producing false witnesses because several of the victims were from the church, and the last thing this church wants is more negative press. The victims said the church wanted the female victims not to report the assaults. No one can state at this point what will turn out to be innocence or guilt. Just assuming he is innocent is naive.",-0.8655,99
