"Daaamn that hit that ""Big David Irving"" gave ""Cousins"" took him off his feet, not to mention the stare down he gave him after the hit... As to say ""Not in My House"" this guy ""Irving"" is only going to get better, fans, commentators etc. call him a freak now wait until he turns it up another notch WOW, I just hope ""Dallas"" can keep him there dude's a ""Beast""? Once our ""Dallas""  defense front line is fully healthy and those not rookies any more, get it together oh yeah we're definitely not taking any prisoners? No need to talk about our offense simply because we ""Dallas"" have all the right pieces, just have to make them play together with some good old fashion ""Tough Love""? What made ""Dallas"" the best team in the 90s, if you said ""Jimmy Johnson"" you're a true cowboy's fan, if not oh well... This man didn't turn a 1-15 team into back to back ""Super Bowl Champions"" by being a nice guy/ coach know he did it by getting rid of old parts/ players and adding exactly all the right+ new parts/ players.... Not to mention what is often referred to as ""The Great Trade Robbery"" I prefer to simply call it great coaching, having the notion to know exactly who, what you need and how to get them.... In this case theirs a quote that simplifies it all ""Don't hate the player hate the game"", yet there's still one more element to that ""Masterpiece"" and it damn sure isn't nice guy... Its called ""Tough Love"" you'll have seen jimmy Johnson many times on fox one of the nicest people you want to meet, that's vintage J.J he did it by doing and being both?!! NUFF Said...",0.9963,356

"i have been a Cowboy fan for a while. I am not into the kneeling thing at all. But my grandson just got a parking ticket, i told him ""there goes your NFL career. Goddell will not tolerate this parking where you want attitude"". I broke his heart and told him that he will be punished. I thinking a parking ticket has got to be a 10 game suspension. And i wont bring up the fact that he accidently kicked the cat going down the stairs last night. OMG. We investigated the incident and found no proof that he intentionally kicked the cat. But we have no cat, it was the neighbors cat that snuck in. But neither here nor there, i am sure that cat kicking should be punished.  Wait, he used an aerosol can outside the way the directions stated. My goodness, he has to be looking at a 2 year suspension. I am talking to him about a career in the NBA.
