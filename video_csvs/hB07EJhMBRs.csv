"TLDW: He overdosed on glucose over a course of 4 years causing hyperglycemia. The bacterial infection from his un-brushed tooth cavity caused a septic shock that had a chain reaction in his immune system and liver leading to his kidneys producing sugary urine.

Addendum and criticism:
The fact that he did not brush his teeth regardless for how long, is circumstantial. For instance, he could have brushed his teeth regularly yet cut his gum while eating a potato chip leading to an ulcer which could have turned septic.

I want to point out that any bacterial infection could have turned septic and put him into Hyperglycemic shock at that point.
