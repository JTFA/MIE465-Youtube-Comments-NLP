3:36 my reaction to every episode of season 4 of Black Mirror,0.0,12
"Actually black mirror got the idea, for that episode, from a book written by someone else. We need to figure out  if they wrote the book before or after Karl's idea. Also for the second part of the episode I really think they talked to Karl or something. It's too much.",0.0,57
"Also, another section that Karl predicted from the same episode was when he came up for the idea of a TV show called 'Look What We Can Do With Science' in which they remove all of the bits a human doesn't need until the patient is just a head with machines going into him. 

This idea was briefly explored by the Dr when he realised he could inflict sexy pain on himself and still get the same enjoyment from it (before going on to murder the homeless man).

Rolo says: ""He spent a week just whittling away at himself. Cut here, a gouge there. I mean, the guy was a doctor. He knew far he could go without it getting fatal."" 

I bet if we look close enough then we can see even more Karl inspiration in the series, perhaps even other shows!",0.2193,161

"Channel 4 Black Mirror was way better. I really disliked Netflix Black Mirror. Americans are good at making science fictions, but Black Mirror was more than that. It was about political satire (National Anthem, Vote for Voodoo), morality (White Bear, Christmas), and how technology‚Äôs changing and ‚Äúblack mirroring‚Äù them. Netflix took it in the wrong way. It seems that Americans audience prefer some shallow or rather direct writing that tells straight them the moral of the story (USS Callister, Crocodile). This is why you hardly see any satric writing in any US shows, most things are based on shock value (doctor story in Black Museum). You hardly find anything deep (USS Cllister, Metalhead, Crocodile). These stories are just so forgettable. I watched the whole season 3 & 4, and remember even fewer plot than Anthem, Voodoo, White Bear and Christmas stories.",-0.2952,177

They both look a bit arrogant and stupid when compared to Karl.
