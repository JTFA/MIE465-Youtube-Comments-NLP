"Dear Friends, Jesus Christ is THE RISEN ONE who shines upon you always. Understand when you worship Jesus Christ you are worshiping a living Deity, not an idolatrous man-made image. Your relationship with Jesus the Christ is meant to be vibrant and challenging as He enters more and more into your life. Do not fear change for it is He who is making you a new creation, with old things passing away and new things continually on the horizon. Embrace all that Jesus Christ can do in your life and find your security in Him alone. Give your life to Jesus Christ this very moment and be ready for a loving, miraculous and awe inspiringly relationship that will span all eternity. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è                 (John 3:16;  Matthew 28:5-7;   2Corinthians 5:17)",0.9823,148

"Here's $5. Try out STASH

https://get.stashinvest.com/christo37p5p

Stash has been the easiest way I've¬† found to save my money and make substantial gains. I set up a withdrawa from my account once a month (I invest $10, but you can set up auto invest for as much or little as you want and you can do any assortment of automatic investments or a single one time investment) Then I pick an area to invest in. I have my money go to ""follow the experts"" and ""All that giltters"".Then the experts at stash put my money to work. However if I ever want to change my investment strategy, I can sell those and chose from 50+ (and counting as they add new ideas) other investment idea's! It has the safety of Betterment or Acorns but the freedom of actually trading stocks. It can't be beat! Making money is awesome!",0.9727,170
