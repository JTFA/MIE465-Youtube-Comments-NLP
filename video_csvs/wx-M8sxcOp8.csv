"Hats off to Coach Pederson. One thing I noticed he‚Äôs doing this year is he‚Äôs spreading the ball around, using the skills of many different players. This is why the eagles are scary good this year. Besides Carson, there isn‚Äôt any particular players that you can narrow in on and ‚Äúremove‚Äùfrom the game. You take out Ajayi, we got Blount, clements, and Barner. You take out Ertz, we got Brent celek. You take out our entire d line, and we have another great d line right behind them. There is mad competition among all of our players, motivating them to play their best. Even if Wentz gets hurt, we have an experienced former eagles QB, nick foles right behind him. Good luck bill belichick, you‚Äôre going to have one heck of a time trying to beat us in the super bowl",0.9501,172
