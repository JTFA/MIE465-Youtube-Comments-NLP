"Alright, this is officially the most epic thing I have ever seen in my life. 

Beats Marvel, DC, and every action scene ever invented.

Bruce Lee and Light Sabers ?!?!
God why is there not a Asian Jedi Master Based on Bruce Lee ?!

Does Hollywood still need to portray us as Smart and Timid ? Lol.

Put a Bruce Lee in StarWars, 
There will be a line camping from USA to China.

Period.

Please make more of these or make a video of how you did this ?

Would love to either work with you to make a fan base short film if your interested. 

This is way to epic to Leave alone.
I don’t mind using my company resources to launch this.

Contact me anytime.
Peace.
