"Another tip - don't fall asleep before liftoff!
I flew over from Hungary specifically to watch the penultimate shuttle launch, Endeavour, and it was scrubbed twice.
Changed return ticket twice and ended up staying a month bumming around Florida whiling away the time until I finally got to see it. The launch was early morning, but the coach left at night and had hours and hours to wander around KSC.
I got to the causeway at 4am and had to wait another few hours, and as I had just driven up from Key West the day before and had hardly slept, I thought I'd just close my eyes for an hour...
Next thing I knew was my rib cage being shaken by the sound of the launch, and I woke up to catch a 2 second glimpse of the shuttle disappearing above the clouds! Pity it was unusually cloudy for a launch.
Still, I was there and got to see it which was the main thing.

As for not bringing a camera if your camera is a phone or a point and shoot then don't bother with the camera just enjoy it with your own eyes but if you have a camera with the view thingy (the thing you put your eye up to to see through the camera lens without using the lcd) it might not be as bad of an idea as you could use the camera zoom lens to get a better view but if you have binoculars you probably should use those instead,0.8605,93

"Hi Tim, thanks for the great advice. Wow - Deja vu all over again - 40+ years later

I grew up in South Florida in the sixties and began watching live Saturn V launches as soon as I could con my Dad in onto driving up from Fort Lauderdale to watch one of the early Apollo launches (Apollo 9 or 10, I think). Later, when I got my driver‚Äôs license, I caught as many launches as I could. Titusville, just three hours away from home and eleven miles west of the launch site, turned out to be the perfect spot for watching launches. Even at eleven miles away, the sight and sound of a live Saturn launch was far beyond anything I had seen on TV. I was addicted. I drove up to watch several Apollo launches including the night launch of Apollo 17, the Skylab launch, and the Apollo-Soyuz launch. I was lucky enough to be at the turning basin press site for the last ever Saturn V launch (Skylab) - where you will be. If this is your first time watching a launch of this magnitude from three miles away, you will be in for a treat. NOTHING and I mean nothing can prepare you for the feeling - not just the sound - but the visceral gut rumbling feeling of those engines. Yes forget the camera. All of my pictures were pretty crappy, but sensory experience is still fondly burned into my memory.

Sadly I have never been to a live watch since, but I still get goose bumps watching launches on YouTube, but now I get watch F9 landings as well. The double sonic booms that arrive at touch down should be awesome in person. Maybe getting there hours ahead of time is OK, but back in the day getting there days ahead of time was often required :-) .

Thank you for the great job you do covering SpaceX and other topics. I applaud your ability to do it full time. I envy you. Then again you have mad    presentation skills!

I have included three of my blog posts below that might be of interest to anyone else reading this. My firsthand accounts of being there. I make no money from this site and I pay to keep it advertisement free so I have no ulterior motives in posting the links other than additional info.

Enjoy the launch!!!!

I regret bringing a camera, which at the time was a very high-quality camera, but pales in comparison to anything professionals and news media provide. Do not bring your camera, don‚Äôt even tempt yourself! I was heartbroken at the reentry. There are no words to describe how I felt. Spending hours before the launch reading the NASA provided materials allowed me to feel like I knew the astronauts on a deeper level than just knowing their names.

Or if you have a fancy radio, you can listen to launch comm relay on 146.940 MHz for Florida launches. And, like Tim said, if you'll be in a public area, show up EARRRRRRRLY!!

It was a land landing, so I got to see all the goods for my first experience. I watched from Jetty Park, and you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs a great place to watch from and meet a lot of people excited about the same thing. I‚Äôve now watched launches from several of the places you mention in this video, and I think you summed it up perfectly. 

Also, where‚Äôs the Falcon Heavy prelaunch party at?! I‚Äôve got Monday night off and hoping to hang with some SpaceX fan boys and girls. :)",0.9674,159
The gantry is great for 39A launches. Though it's pretty pricey for only a chance at seeing a launch. There's a video I took on my channel showing the view from there. It's pretty loud though.,0.91,40

There are restricted areas around KSC up to 3 miles on the water ways and Atlantic Ocean. If you violate it you may find yourself looking down the barrel of a 50 cal.,-0.7003,35
"There is actually a much simpler solution, with all the launch pads so close to the sea I can just rent a boat and get out right next to it to watch the (aborted)  launch from just a few hundred meters away ;)",0.4939,46
"There's another whole aspect of launch watching that you can miss out watching from Titusville or Cocoa Beach, and that's visibility after the launch. I think the best place to watch launches, especially night launches where you can follow the rocket all the way to orbit with your binoculars, and even more especially for polar orbit launches is Daytona Beach, 40 miles from the launch point.

Your absolute best view of ignition and early flight to 30 seconds is always on television or You Tube. After that, from 40 miles you are not looking unspectacularly up the tail of the rocket, but from the side where you can visualize the path *much better.* I was lucky to be able to watch every single launch of the Saturn V ever from the beach. With my six inch telescope I read the ""United States"" on the side of the lower stage.

SpaceX launches are great, either from Daytona Beach, or even from my home in DeLand. The first 30 seconds is on video, but after that I have a prime seat whether at work or at home! I'll be very interested in the *sound* from the Falcon Heavy and how it compares to the sound of the Saturn Vs. I'll try to record it, but the frequencies are so low that normal microphones probably just won't get the job done. We'll see. No matter how this goes, it will be great!",0.9687,268

"Tim ( AKA ROCKET MAN ) You do an Awesome job with your Site !
Information , Enthusiasm , Music .........
As for Photo/Video/Audio recording I do recommend Capturing the moment ....
Have Tripods , some type of Stick/Pole , Camera Attachments ( like clips , Duck Tape , Hat/Chest like GoPro etc ) Lawn Chair etc.
But set these up so you can View the Launch unobstructed and not hassled with equipment .....
As I get older I cherish all the moments I Captured bad or good ....
Also Tim have you considered adding a  'EVERYDAY ASTRONAUT' Patch to your Store ?

"Tim, didn‚Äôt you love the new SpaceX video of a Falcon Heavy animation with the Bowie song ‚ÄúLife on Mars‚Äù released today?! It was glorious and I‚Äôve already watched it ten times or more. üöÄ I really like how SpaceX and Elon Musk have a whimsical sense of humor about what they are doing, which adds to the emotional impact of the event ‚Äî your videos also convey this in spades!

Was at a conference in Texas last year and there was a launch the next week. Planned my whole trip around getting there and having a day extra if it is delayed but it was delayed by a month :/ Flew all the way from South Africa. It was my only shot possibly ever... KSC was cool though,-0.4497,61

lover and a hater before passing judgement try researching it there are quite a few articles on it. It was expandable partly because Spacex has built up a huge stock pile of used rockets (block 3s which aren't optimised for resuse?). They want to start phasing in block 4 and I think 5 versions of their falcon 9,-0.1426,63
