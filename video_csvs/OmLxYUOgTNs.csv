"Got it.  Triple doubles > Finals win + MVP.  

LeBron makes EVERYONE around him better, except for star players, rookies, etc.  Gilbert Arenas and Jamison, ball hogs, brought a better version of Larry Hughes out; as a 3rd cog.  Hughes with James, as the 2nd cog, and krrrrpklunk.  Wade ceases being great, to let LeBron be great.  Bosh has slide over, and reinvent his game.  Love, same.  Kyrie, same.  

Durant is spoiled with a star cast.  And that cast, still produced as well, and more efficiently, than they had without Durant.  They won in Year 1 with Durant.  

LeBron goes to GS, flip Durant out, and Klay would have to get traded for some reason, Curry would have to stand around more, Green would be occupying the same areas of the floor as LeBron, so of course, he'd have to do something else and be less toolsy and less of a glue guy, the ball is going through Mr I DO EVERYTHING well, so there's less ball movement, etc.  People would be going on about how old the Warriors are, the bench is suddenly viewed as weak, Kerr's a terrible coach, and apparently, LeBron is saddled with a team that doesn't try.

Meanwhile, KD, Love, and Kyrie, are all having a blast.  Thompson is a double-double machine and loves playing the game; 2nd Team All Defense.

LeBron is a PER God, he's one of the 5 greatest players, but enough with he makes everyone better, and Durant sold out by leaving triple double GOD Westbrook in the rear view mirror.  

Klay still averages 20, Green still puts up big numbers across the board, Curry still gets 25 a game, Westbrook still put up great numbers while playing with Westbrook, Harden came through OKC and look at where he's at today.  Which of the two players is better to play with, while still allowing his teammate to play at the same level, and be confident doing so?  Assists are - at times (Kobe/Westbrook) - are overrated, and playing off the ball (Jordan/Durant), is vastly underrated, and allows your teammates to do what they're good at.  Pippen, Grant, Rodman, Kukoc, still produced as they should have, with Jordan.",0.9952,445

Kevin love became another player. A piece of trash. Only standing at the 3 point line. Not moving. And has limited his game. Even though he's averaging 20 plus pts but most of those points come from rebounds. Kyrie IRVING don't wanna play with LeBron. ? No wonder why.

"Jalen Rose is usually right about this stuff, but he has the 2017 Finals totally wrong. Just ask Kyrie Irving: LBJ's stat line was a vanity stat line. After game 5, Lebron looked pretty happy with himself, he got out the series with a terrific stat line.  Was the outcome of the series a forgone conclusion? Absolutely not. Everybody seems to forget how dominant the Cavs looked destroying the East, and more than a few people picked them to beat the Warriors. Game 3 was totally within grasp...

And if you looked at Lebron's stat line you'd have to wonder, what happened? What happened was, Lebron's 4th quarter point TOTAL for games 1-3 was a whopping 11 points. What does that mean? It means Lebron was taking care of himself in the first 3 quarters of those games, and leaving nothing in the tank for crunch time. Who played just as many Finals minutes as LBJ but DID have the juice when it mattered? 

KD.

It as absolutely absurd to say that a guy who totals 11 points in the 4th quarters of 3 crushing losses somehow outplayed the guy that was dominant from series beginning to series end. PLUS Lebron played absolutely ZERO defense in that series.

Will Cain went in on KD for going to GSW now he has KD NUTS IN HIS MOUTH every show and does the skip bayless on LBJ EVERY time he's on.. Haven't heard him say one good thing about Bron lol,0.3954,42
Will Cain you don't know crap about basketball so just shut your mouth,0.2924,13
Will beat Jalen this argument....and KD is better than LeBron...better on D and O.,0.4404,19
Will cain always goes against LeBron. kd will never pass LeBron just because of how much of a coward kd is. WHo joins a team he blew a 3-1 lead to just because he couldn't beat the warriors or LeBron. Because half of you know if you take away one of there players the Cavs are a better team. Cause we all know lebron dang there beat the warriors by himself in 2015. People act like kd is better because his team beats lebron all the time but its really just because all the fire power they have. SO STOP HATING ON LEBRON BECAUSE HE IS WAYY BETTER THAN KD's WIRE CORD BUILT SELF,-0.8735,120

You don't know what you are talking about Jordan was in the league for 7 or 8 years before Pippen got there.¬† Jordan was winning MVP DPOY MVP awards without Pippen.¬† It was Jordan or nothing,0.7506,38
You're the one not making sense. Pippen gradually got better himself until he became the perfect complement to Jordan. Most NBA players didn't put up amazing numbers their rookie season they gradually got better and better the more they played. However you feel about Pippen and Jordan my point remains that KD isn't as good as LeBron. Why is it that everyone compares LeBron to Jordan but not KD to Jordan. Because Jordan never joined the team who beat him after blowing a 3-1 against them. The move to Golden State single-handedly killed whatever case KD had for being better than LeBron or Jordan.,0.2264,111

"so every1 is bashing KD for going to Golden State  - okay... Do you all forget that Lebron got beat by Boston Celtics in 6 games in 09 - 10 season?... so what did Lebron do? Oh yea he took his talents to South Beach to form a Super team involving 3 perennial all stars...  Then in 2014 HE CAME BACK TO THE CAVS BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS GREENER IN THE LAND IN THE FORM OF A YOUNG SUPERSTAR NAMED KYRIE IRVING! Where he tried to Recruit a Superteam himself, D Wade (One of the greatest SG of all time) Derrick Rose, etc etc. and when THAT didnt work out... the GM took the reigns and now he is STILL PLAYING on a RIDICULOUSLY STACKED TEAM - so why is KD getting all the hate?... if Lebron has been recruiting pieces since he FIRST LEFT CLEVELAND???",0.8968,164
surpassed what?? 1 is better than 3 rings>>?? for a teams the hell.. drink a venom please3,0.594,25

üòÇüòÇüòÇ yall all jokes KD never said he was the Best in the World than leave his team to make a superteam in Miami...
