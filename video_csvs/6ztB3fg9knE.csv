     Israel is a true democracy and a beacon of light in an otherwise cruddy part of the world. One can see overhead pictures where you can see a stark demarcation between Israel and, let's say Egypt. Israel is plush and developed. Egypt a barren wasteland. They're really the only country in that area that actually _produces, innovates, and creates._ Technology comes out of Israel. Medical innovations come out of Israel. Scientific discoveries in optics, physics, biotech, computer sci, chemistry, robotics, etc... come out of Israel. Hell, from what I understand cell phone technology was developed in Israel. So was the Pentium and Celeron processor. 
     Israel is our friend and has contributed to the world. Syria, Jordan, etc... not so much. The only thing Arab countries produce is oil (and dates and olive oil I guess. Oh, and some cool rugs too). And they couldn't even do that but not for America's and the West's help in developing oil extraction techniques and building infrastructure, which those countries turned around and commandeered from us and declared them state owned. So yeah, I'm for backing Israel even if the Jewish Holocaust did not happen. Makes sense. 
     And just because the Holocaust happened doesn't mean I'm gonna necessarily give more sympathy to Jews, or treat them differently. They don't garner more sympathy from me that amounts to anything. It's the past, and the Jews I know don't really make it an issue. It's something to note, not something to wallow over.
     When blacks wallow over their history...I get it. It is very angering. But like it or not, clinging to the past has not helped your people. That's a solid fact. Rather, that clinging has stunted your people's growth. It puts a subtle chip on many of your shoulders that eeks out in the form of attitude. No one likes someone with attitude, and so it affects interactions with others. 
     So yeah, blacks have been truly undeservingly screwed over... _in the past._  55 years...3 generations ago. Tell me *now* how blacks are truly undeservingly screwed over. If there is any discrimination it's almost mostly because of _class,_ *not* _skin color._  I know several decent middle class to upper middle class black folk who live in decent, middle to upper middle class areas. They tell me they do not get harassed or pulled over unnecessarily. No one clutches their purses when they walk by in a nice restaurant. When Oprah talked about that incident in that Swedish or Swiss store a few said that she was probably being a bitch and was treated such because of her attitude, not skin color. A study in New Jersey showed that blacks got pulled over more *not* because of skin color but because they broke speed laws more than others!
     When I was in college, I drove a lowered pickup truck and I got pulled over a lot. That all stopped when I finally bought a Limited Edition Explorer. Same town, same skin color...different presentation of ratchetness , different results. 
     Newsflash...if Egyptians were black then blacks enslaved Jews. Nonetheless, Egyptians enslaved Jews. Should Jews demand reparations from Egypt? Since they built the pyramids, should they demand a cut of the tourist dollars? Vietnamese refugees fled here and lost everything back home. Should they go back to -Saigon- Ho Chi Minh city and demand they get their stuff returned? That happened a lot more recently than slavery. Speaking of which, should DoS go back to Africa and confront those African countries and tribes that sold their people into slavery and demand compensation and an apology? Native Americans owned slaves...should blacks go over to some reservation and kick some redskin ass?
     It all sounds ridiculous, and that's how many people feel about DoS and slavery. Yeah, it was bad, but please move on. The Vietnamese moved on and now they're doing better than the average white here in America. Jim Crow sucks, and now it's against the law. Segregation happened...and when I was growing up I was bused to inner city schools to help rectify that. (Ironically, now blacks want to segregate themselves in some college campuses). So the country has made *GREAT* strides in rectify it's horrible past. Not acknowledging that and in fact demanding *MORE* of this country than you do of *YOURSELVES* is in fact losing allies to your cause. 
     Lastly, a *LARGE* source of black dysfunction and problems stem from the lack of fathers present in black boys' lives. Tell me, what does white supremacy have to do with unmarried black women having irresponsible sex with unmarried (or married) black men? What does white supremacy have to do with a 72% illegitimacy rate in the overall black community, with a close to a 100% illegitimacy rate in many black communities? What does black supremacy have to do with black women having babies from several different men, and black men just screwing everything in sight? The problem with blaming everything on the past is that you end up not putting blame on yourself when you should. By being in denial you rob yourself at the chance of correcting your own defects in a meaningful and lasting way.",-0.9962,1010

"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?

Take a moment and consider the state of our world:


-The Middle East is at the tipping point.


-The world hates Israel.


-There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.


-There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).


-Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.


-Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.


-Perversion is running rampant.


-The weather is out of control.


-We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.


-Education is in the toilet.


-Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.

... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.

None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.

... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...

*Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.

Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say‚Ä¶?

What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?

Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.

As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!

Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...

Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.

Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...

Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought¬† you were so worth the effort that He created you!

Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?

If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:

Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""

Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""

Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""

Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""

C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""

Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""

Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""

Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""

Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.

**

Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.

Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""

Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",-0.9986,2013

She also doesn't understand why she's leaving ? You're leaving because you didn't do well, and you were also a problem we all know that Kennedy says it was professional and it was, I think sending someone home because their being bitchy and rude is a good choice because this position and being the QUEEN Of this show also means you handle yourself well, and milk isn't right now, she needs a good cup of t.
