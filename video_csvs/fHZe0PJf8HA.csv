"He's right. It is mandatory to kill each fish you catch if it is of ""legal"" size. I'm pretty sure though, that most anglers ( includig me ;) ) release nearly every fish we catch.

"Hey Jon B. I'm a long time viewer. I think I have a pretty interesting fishing challenge idea. You're pretty well acquainted with smallmouth, largemouth,  Florida largemouth, and spotted bass, but these are just four black bass species. There's a total of about 9 recognized black bass species. These include Guadalupe bass, Suwanee river bass, shoal bass, and redeye bass. The Guadalupe bass is found in Texas. All of these species are found within the U.S. Most have a very restricted range of only a couple rivers or tributaries. You should do some type of challenge of trying to catch all the different black bass species. It is a feat that only a few anglers can claim to have accomplished.",0.7017,140
Hey Jon! If you want to catch Bowfin I'd recommend you stay in Texas! I have a spot down here near Houston where they can potentially get 15 or more pounds and they destroy topwater baits! If you're interested in fishing there or have any questions or whatever just let me know,0.4359,55
"Hey Jon,
I am a young (14) fisherman from germany and you are absolutely right. 
That is horrible BUT literally EVERYONE here practices catch&release
You should seriously come over here to Germany (Berlin) in Summer because until 1st of May the closed period for predatorfishing takes place. 

Also I have a good Idea for upcoming videos: 
You should drop a song. I mean you sang in ya life before.
You could call yourself ,,Lil Lure''
If you guys have any question to a german fisherman jusk ask me :)
Looking forward to replies :D",0.8573,110
"Hey Jon, 
I am from Germany and I want to explain to you what is up with the no catch and release thing.
So the law says you may not fish just for fun, so it basically says you need to have a good purpose/ reason why you want to catch fish and that reason would be to eat it.
But of course most anglers here do catch and release in fact, most of them just dont show the release on camera because those freaks from PETA will maybe report you.
So basically its all a matter of interpretation so if you catch a perch and you only wanted to fish for pike you can release the perch with no doubt.
I know this sucks kind of but maybe I could clarify you a little bit and you will change your mind and come over to Germany to fish because we have a lot to offer.

Greetings from Germany",0.5023,168
"Hey Jon, i‘m also from Germany and i do catch & release all the time. It is not that you get prosecutions when releasing fish. By the way, love your Videos, please never stop! :)",0.7351,43
