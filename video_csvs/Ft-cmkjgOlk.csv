"good work on the build, but the cam acceleration must be to high for the cable strength.  here is a formula for ballistic energy.  run it with some known bullet loads and you will see that the lighter and faster bullets have the most energy.  as an example, heavier bullets raise the chamber pressure too high at higher velocities...another and very important factor is stopping distance.  the less distance, the higher the energy delivered.  so a hardened tip or even carbide with reduced diameter/area will shear the higher strength material.  do some engineering / physics and you will gain a lot.  find the energy required to punch thru the material.  find the max strength of the cable and go from there.  in excel:
B2 = velocity in meters/second
B3 = mass in KG
B4 = Resulting Joules of Energy or Newton Meter
B4=(B2^2*B3)/2as you can see the velocity is squared.  for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction...(m/s^2 x KG)/2...
this is a start.  there are a lot of online resources for physics.  try to get the vectors worked out so the acceleration is a constant across the entire rotation of the cam.   sorry, buy i don't have the time to give much more now...in the middle of packing and moving.
