Having the camera low and angled like that makes the viewer eyes draw towards your feet, which takes away from the magical effect of it.

"This is good!  Really good.  Your lean frame and fluid movements really do evoke some of the very essence of Michael Jackson, which is something I can't say for a lot of his impersonators.  One of the things I did while watching this video was to refocus my mind and try seeing if I could believe it was actually MJ onscreen.  As I watched, I could see that your movements are a bit more fluid than MJ's, but that could be because MJ learned all his precision movements from dancing greats such as Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, and so forth.

One thing that trips up most impersonators is learning the dance steps, but not feeling them.  When MJ performed, his personal self was set aside, and his stage self took over.  He'd stop thinking outside himself, and pull inward to concentrate on only the dance and the music.  To see a consummate performer like him do this is magical.  One minute, shy and soft voiced, and within a few seconds, his voice becomes strong and his movements sharp and snappy.  It's no wonder we all watched in wonder at his transformation.  Those who seek to impersonate him often practice all the moves, but none of the psychology behind his singing and dancing.  You are the closest I have yet seen when it comes to total focus on the music and the movements.  The moment you hit that zen moment, we all will see Michael come to life once again.

Thank you for sharing your talent, and I do hope to see more of your work and talent in the years upcoming!",0.971,301
