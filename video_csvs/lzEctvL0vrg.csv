"Actually this can be done even under combat stress.  Now I must qualify this statement and tell you that I have never been in an actual combat situation where I ever saw anyone do this (thank God!.)  The reason why this technique was included in our training curriculum is the large numbers of these given to our erstwhile allies as well as the ""friendly"" countries that we didn't give them to but allowed them to piggyback their contracts with ours (unofficially of course) with the permission of our State Dept., DOD, and Commerce.  When all was said & done this firearm still is very widely distributed around the world.  Our friends today could be our enemies tomorrow, hence the training.
The technique (as we were taught it) required two hands to prevent being shot in the attempt, AND I REALLY HOPE NO ONE OUT THERE READING THIS IS STUPID ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT THIS WITH A LOADED FIREARM!!!!!!!  That having been said if you are in a situation bad enough to need this you are probably dead anyway so you have little to lose except perhaps days to months of torture which in my mind is a real plus.
Sequence of actions:
     1) Simultaneously or as close as possible to it, the left palm moves forward to apply pressure to the end of the barrel while the right hand grasps the firearm where the index finger joint is a little in or behind the ejection port.  NOTE: the larger your hands the more difficult this entire thing becomes.  
The reason you depress the barrel is the M9/92FS has a disconnect that prevents firing if any part of the slide is out of battery (not fully moved forward to the maximum extent) and pressureon the end of the barrel accomplishes this.  The reason you grasp the firearm simultaneously is to prevent the firearm from being pushed back towards the holder,  thus restoring ""in battery"" and getting your butt shot off.  The positioning of the ""grabbing"" hand is a best case scenario.  The most important thing is to grab the pistol tightly a little behind the exposed barrel and hold on tight no matter what happens.  Trust me when I tell you that no one ever expect this apparently stupid act because it is contrary to human nature to move towards a deadly weapon. Most folks have little true knowledge as to how a firearm works, so you also have that going for you.
     2) Providing you have survived so far, you are now fully committed so you must HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE!  The adversary will of course attempt to pull the pistol away from you. This is an automatic and natural  response and you can use their momentum against them.  NOTE: you don't have to worry about holding onto them at this point because they will be holding onto you! Holding the pistol very firmly and steadily push the adversary back into a wall if possible.  Everything gets much more difficult rolling around on the floor.
     3) As in the video, push the slide release button with either the index or middle finger and rotate the slide release down with your thumb.  Hopefully you are attentive enough to take advantage of any other opportunities as they develop .... meaning if you have the opportunity to bite them and stay on task DO IT.  I don't care how nasty they are, or how bad they smell etc.,  bite them HARD, if you can bite something off, DO IT.  They will of course become highly agitated at that point ;-) and the added distraction will only help you.
     4) With the slide release rotated pull hard on the slide and it will come off the frame.  Grab them with your left hand and strike hard repeatedly into the area just to the side of the wind pipe.  The left side as you see it is ideal, but don't play around trying to do it perfectly.  Keep hitting them there repeatedly until you see a lot of you know what.
Concentrate on what you are doing.  Do not rush.  Everything will appear to slow down and you may feel you are too weak.  In reality you are moving extremely fast, you are also much stronger than you think.  Epninephrine (Adrenaline) is surging through your body and you can either channel it into the fight or just flail around.  That is why practice of all types is necessary.  The warrior spirit and muscle memory are the king and queen of close combat.  This is about as close as you can possibly get!",-0.4229,849
Actually this could work out of pure surprise. Also you could at the same time push the gun out of alignment. The enemy guy would think you are trying to wrestle the gun from him and in first reaction brace himself for a fight. Pulling off the slide would be completely unexpected.,-0.8316,56

"Do it with your right hand instead using your thumb to push the button and simultaneously pulling the gun down and away so that you pivot out of the line of fire.

If you're grabbing it with your left hand then then pivot and grab the gun the other way so your thumb is on the button and you are facing the same direction as your adversary. Again in this way you are out of the line of fire and because you are next to your 'assailant' you can sense their movement through contact and both your chests are facing in the same direction.

"Isn't the vz.38 a .32 ACP? Or did they make two versions? Also, the fact that this is even theoretically possible is yet another good reason why you DON'T hold someone at gun point at a range they can reach you or your weapon at. Never mind Hollywood, the WHOLE POINT of a firearm is so you can hit the person while the person is unable to touch you. If you want to stand close and intimidate them an look tough, get a damn knife. Standing close to your target negates 85% of the advantage of having a gun, and juts gives them a chance to knock it from your grasp, try to grab it from you, or disassemble it before you can react (less common). I cringe in movies when the actor inevitably stands right next to the target and holds his gun to their head (usually while finally racking a round into the slide and/or cocking it, sometimes for the 4th time). And then the actor usually goes on to give some virtue-signalling speech about how guns ought to be taken out of the hands of the civilians to prevent violence, and how al violence is bad. Never mind that he just stared in his 15th movie about a wronged, noble hero taking mattes into his own hands and getting revenge on the bad guys and the corrupt police with an assortment of firearms and implausible gun fights, or his 7th about police officers who tear through town spraying bullets wildly at the bad guy's car, while causing mayhem and risking the lives of bystaders and property everywhere.

Sidestepping and pushing away the gun is a common martial art maneuver and removes the threat quicker than directly pulling the slide off.

Are they amateur or professional, are they collected or stunned that you are grabbing the end of their gun? Do they want to hurt anyone? I'd say just one of these and certainly combinations would give a quick person enough time to do that maneuver",-0.7187,80
"To begin, sure, if you ARE highly trained in gunslide-jutsu, it's not even the most practical move either:

1. To begin, do shooters always have M9 Berettas? No! So, in order to master gunslide-jutsu, you would have to become highly trained in at least 10 or so handgun-disassembly techniques to be safe from gunpoint thieves, 15-25+ to be safe, which, would take years and years of practice to do.

2. So, you have the superhuman learning skills to learn 25 different firearm disassembly techniques quickly? (or more, the more, the better), cool, but too bad! there's hundreds of more efficient ways to stop a bad guy whom is pointing his gun at you than the one you mastered. For example, if I were you, I'd grab the gunner by the wrist, point the gun he's holding down using your control over his arm, release the mag, then pull the slide off while you're in control of his gun. Or do the disarm, pull the gun out of his hands, then disassemble the gun. Or do a normal disarm and then shoot him.",-0.9779,217
"Try that on a sig sauer P226 and an M&P. All it takes is the lever to come down and then the slide comes off. But good luck doing this trick on a glock, walther p99, walther PPQ unless you can press the two tabs down to take the slide off. Also remember a 1911, sig Sp2022, browning, and CZ75 a slide release pin comes out for field stripping.",0.6908,80
"Try the Jackie Chan maneuver from Rush Hour, where he takes the gun off Chris Tucker. My buddy was calling bullshit on it, so we tested it with one of those spring operated bb guns, (not loaded of course.) I took it right off him. Now, if you grab the slide and push it back a little a lot of guns won't be able to strike the firing pin. Not sure if that would or wouldn't buy some time for the Beretta slide removal, but you can keep it the from being pointed at your body.",-0.5267,108
Very good grasshopper.,0.4927,4
Well it should be possible to bring pull the slide back over the hammer to prevent it from firing no?,-0.34,21
"What about an Mk22? I ask because of Metal Gear Solid 3 The Boss disassembles the gun in a more ""realistic"" situation (while push naked snake down with cqc)",-0.2023,34
What about the move to disarm someone Jackie Chan shows Chris Tucker in the first Rush Hour?,0.0,18
When I first got my 92 I was like “wow that’s super easy”  ... if someone already has it pointed at you that’s a hard pressed maneuver. But I think if it’s a situation where the gunman get tackled or grappled as he’s drawing the pistol it might be a valid idea to try and control the guy’s arm and remove the slide if possible.,0.7184,79
"When I was a corpsman in the 90 the marines showed us how to do this. If I remember,  the button on the take down lever wasn’t on those models. It was easy and we got good and quick at this. This was before the movie. We were shown this because as we were told, the gangs in LA had learned it to LAPD the hard way. I always figured that’s why that button got added.",0.6597,88
While this may be plausible its no where near real world practical. 9/10 times you would just end up getting shot. The person who already had the gun cocked and loaded has barely any trigger pull before the gun would go off in your face. Movie magic is all to play here.,-0.5574,56
"While using this move is probably possible, there are many other disarming techniques a martial artist could use that would be easier.",0.4215,24
While you can’t actually disassemble it you can prevent an M1911A1 from firing by simply pushing the slide slightly backwards.,-0.3182,23
"Whille on Active duty in the early 90s, we were taught about this, apparently Biker gangs had been seen practicing this to disarm arresting officers.",0.4019,28
"With a distraction, or the sudden movement Jet Li did in the movie, I'd say it's possible",-0.3818,19
"With a full magazine and a round in the chamber, that probably won't happen unless you're a ninja toddler.  Irrespective, a finger in the chamber will hurt, but not as much as a bullet",-0.296,38
"With a sidestep you could probably get it done without being shot but, yeah it doesn't take long to pull a trigger.
Still... you can do this stuff with one hand which is cool in a way.",0.8765,41
"With some practice it’s probably possible in real world, although it would be less technical to rip the entire gun from their hand. Part of my law enforcement training includes disarming subjects when being held at gun point. With a little simple distraction you can get off the line of fire and disarm someone relatively easily.  Neat video, Gun Jesus takes on ‘Wanted’ next ?",-0.323,74
"Worst design ever 😲
Now you need someone with training to do it...",-0.6249,14
"YOU COULD DOTHIS IN REAL LIFE but, you got to expect for the first shot to come out when you grab the gun,then the bolt did not cycle so the gun need to be recock to fire. personnaly i think it would be easier to just go for the magazine ejection button cause it mostly work the same way on all gun and not every asshole have a beretta",-0.7532,73
"Yeah, they faked it, but notice that in that scene, Jet Li doesn't just pull the slide off.  He grabs the gun and holds it, turns and kicks Murtaugh, then turns back and pulls the slide off.  A problem is, why didn't Riggs shoot when Li grabbed the gun.  He had plenty of time, and given that the man grabbed his firearm, he absolutely should have!  Would he have hit Li?  Absolutely!  He doesn't even move the gun, so it's not like Riggs was pointing at Murtaugh, now.  Of course, the risk still existed, but at that point, WHY NOT JUST TAKE THE GUN FROM RIGGS???

Obvious solution: cops need to start carrying 1911s if they want automatics.  Problem solved.",-0.962,146
Yes it can be done but you watch guys like Jet li and Jackie Chan do this stuff when they're highly trained experts.,0.6249,24
"You absolutly can do that with an M9 under pressure. It takes some training just like anything else. Even if there is a strugle, it can still be done without much effort. Reaction is A LOT slower then action especially when you take somone by suprise. Even if a round goes off it doesn't hurt your hand much (if you feel it at all bc of adrenaline) and this move can still be done if the M9 is out of battery.
The draw back is that the M9 is not a very common handgun you will run into anymore. 
Possible.. yes, but you're more likely to run into safe action pistols out there.",0.7117,125
You are so awesome Ian!!,0.7799,7
"You can't pull a jet Li, however, you can pull a Jason Bourne : 

First, grab the gun and push away from you, then attack gunwielder and keep his weapon, finally disassemble gun to render it harmless before leaving the scene",-0.7964,46
"You cannot do it under time stress, unless you are/were Jet Li lmao. But I'm glad you made this video! I remember watching lethal weapon with my dad back in the day, and the scene where he pulls the slide off always blew my mind. Very very cool sir Ian",0.7239,57

"actually if you go back you will see that he doesnt do it as fast as you think, he hold Gibson's arm with one hand, hold the gun with the other, kicks Danny Glover, and THEN removes the barrel.

of course, that would still leave Mel Gibson to shoot him, since nothing is stopping his trigger finger at that moment. but if Li instead, locked MG's finger in place so he COULDNT shoot, then it would work flawlessly.",-0.2681,89
"actually its very possible. fact is that if the slide and barrel is pushed back slightly, the gun cannot fire, pushing back jams the hammer. its a very common practice in specialized units to disassemble a firearm in self defence.",0.0809,45

its like saying you cant grab a knife thats been swung at you, yet ive personally seen someone do it. buddy swung the knife the person stepped back knife missed and they grabbed the back of the blade before the attacker had a chance to swing it again. though that mightve had more to do with the attacker being high and not knowing how to use a knife properly.",-0.8765,137
