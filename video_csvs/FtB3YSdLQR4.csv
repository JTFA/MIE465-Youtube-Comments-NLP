My point is that Akademiks is powered by the popular culture, not some higher ups. He doesn't need a job from a company etc. desus and Mero are very funny and I'm a fan but let's be honest. More people know Akademiks then they do these guys.",0.8441,122

"Oh Katie you poor misinformed propaganda spewing social justice princess. Love the part when you said that basically all of a sudden now there's racists everywhere, the population of racist people in your warped perception magically skyrocketed somehow. On it's face, your statement that I paraphrased is utterly moronic and patently false. The problem is people with your collective mentality that feed each other all the same ridiculous misinformation that helps to keep your anxiety down in your make believe ""safe spaces"". The truth is people like you and especially the two degenerates sitting on  either side of you(who by the way are wack as hell corny and not funny at all, oh yeah and they are racists if I ever heard one, without question, not even up for debate) are the undisputed real bigots and racists. Those two men who I won't even mention their names because they're irrelevant in my book are so far beyond the pale of being funny  have a show somehow  where they laugh constantly at their own dumb corny so called ""jokes"". Basically Katie you're a female that's in a male dominated profession and I believe the only reason why ESPN (the new President Trump bashing channel to add to the long list already)hired you is because that you're a halfway decent looking straight broad and not a butch bull lesbo. Cuz real red blooded American straight men don't want to look at one of those on TV. But you aren't the best qualified to be a professional sports expert analyst or wherever your job title is. Just like  myself who is a blue collar bladesmith/CNC machinist and former military a veteran who served my country honorably for eight years probably shouldn't be doing a traditional job that female's excel at like an interior decorator or a beauty pageant coach. One more thing about the racist comment you hastily made Katie. There aren't more racist people in the  United States since President Trump took office that's patently false. However you and other colleagues in the MSM are quick to call another fellow American citizen racist if they don't agree with everything you believe in with  your extremist far left  political ideology. Are all the black and spanish citizens who voted for President Trump racists? According to you I guess they are racist against themselves.

Also Katie the 7.62×39 is the caliber bullet the ""AK"" rifle is chambered in. And pick another rifle if you're gonna go with the sniper metaphor. An AK-47 would be the last rifle I would pick to snipe something. It's only accurate out to between 250-300 meters max. I'd go with a 338 Lapua Mag or a 300 Win Mag as my top two picks.
