"@Milly Borkovic  You're right, and the one thing he's been struggling with - as all comedy as a field has - since the election is the constant utilization of ""President Punchline"".  Its testament to the skill, talent and creativity of everyone in the comedy field to have to go over the same ground over and over and over seeking new and original material.  

Seth has done so well, but, I am certain this interview was a delight for him just to have something other to talk about; wouldn't you agree?
