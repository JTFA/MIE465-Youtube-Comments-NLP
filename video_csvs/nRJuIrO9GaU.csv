Black men were once all suspect, then we added brown people whether Muslim or not, we're throwing in Hollywood stars along with police and priests and politicians, and now we're finally coming back round to all women can't be trusted. Who is benefitting from all this?!
The backlash was inevitable when it was clear that men who suffer abuse in silence are left out of the picture. We're all in this together. We're all raising the next generation of suspects.

Same goes for all the other cases against him.

"timesup# movement had it with harvey and matt lauer and all that big names.. But now accusing aniz ansari, james franco for a bad date is a cheap fame shot. These women didn't appeared on any show but only just tweeting. There is a big difference in sexually harassing someone while in business with them or over a period of time and having a bad experience with someone on a date.Drunk people often make mistakes of going over the top but if he still forced her after she rejected his advances then it's way wrong and she should have reported it to police right away not after all this time and not when you know there is a metoo movement going on. A clear sign of greed and fame sorry to say.",-0.9737,139
