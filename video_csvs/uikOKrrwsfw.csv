"AWWW..this women is so adorable and sweet! She shares the traditional food that she and her chef mate(s) cook and even talks to the customers once she serves. I am still young and my dad owns a restaurant, when I do become a waitress, I will talk to the customers for sure and smile and tell jokes and tell me stories. It makes them give you more tips..and well..who doesn't like more money by being that kind of waiter/waitress?! :D 
I will always cherish this video, and I hope this restaurant will resume with greatness. (If that makes sense. XD) ❤️👍🏼",0.9732,127
