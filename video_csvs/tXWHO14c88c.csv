""" She was playing a CHARACTER""

No, she was playing a role, just like a sports star is playing a role & that role was actor, where she put her self out there as a sexual commodity.

After all they could have got a 72 year old octogenarian to play the character, but they didn't, they chose her to play the role because she had the sex appeal they wanted in the movie. Just like the Olympics gets athletes to compete  & not people who aren't athletes because those athletes are playing a role.",0.891,103

"""Your work"" was part of a movie about a rapist and a girl with a desire to KILL people that she was willing to act on, and just echoing a self-serving ideological anger against men is the best you can do? Twist, twist, twist. Women can do not wrong.  

THAT was your work!  You are dissociating yourself from all bad, all gray even. You were a very young girl. What were you doing in such a movie?  Very lucky in some ways, but clearly a questionable role in a questionable work, that was not YOUR work. But you submitted to it.  You had a choice.  ""Your"" work? Ok, then take responsibility.  You are not an angel.

It was someone else's work that you served freely for money.  What planet do you want us all to follow you to?  

Women look like silly irresponsible girls because of the mindlessness of this present feminist movement.  Why not talk about what it means to be an ADULT?

You went to Harvard to think I hope.  How might you have responded better to such emails and radio programs?  How about talking publicly about what you believe about those subjects.  Using it as an opportunity?  You had the public eager to hear you.  Instead you want to blame ""society.""  Turn it into feminist tyrad against men -- against everyone but you, or the numerous compromises women make.   More women need to say, I have no respect for such a little girl stance as an adult.  Group mentality to project our shadow side on men.  GROW UP.",0.9566,304
"""maybe men can say and do whatever they want, but women can not""

Basically only women are saying that. I haven't heard any man say that, ever. And now men need to be bullied by made up terms like 'patriarchy', and made up concepts like the 'gender wage gap'",0.0,60

"Well that was 4 minutes of nothing. I'm not really sure what you are talking about when you say women cant express themselves. You are literally on a giant stage with a microphone amplifying your voice as you express yourself. Seems to me women are expressing their sexuality pretty well. Its on the street, on my TV, in my workplace. Lately feels like i cant turn my head without seeing a woman sexualize herself.",0.7731,82

"What white men have to face everyday is bolsheviks and ((Natalie Portman)) trying to divide white women from them depicting their fathers, brothers, boyfriends and  husbands as monsters with propaganda and flooding their countries with muslim rapists and other third worlders that will kill white women and sell them on slave markets. I enjoy to see these white women trying to destroy their men's will power and testosterone, let's see what happens to them when they are overrun by hunter-gatherer patriarchal civilization from 7th century Arabia. Stupid women, they have no clue what is coming and don't care of the safety of their progeny. They are on a suicidal path and men must stand up, take the lead and stop this madness before is too late.",-0.9794,139
"What white women in Murica have achieved in 1963 with Second Wave Feminism is AIDS, cultural marxism, nihilism and hedonism. Second Wave was created by the CPUSA (Communist Party of America). Feminists are what are called ""useful idiots"" in marxian theory, they want to destroy family and the will power and testosterone of men to pave the way for the victory of Bolshevism and State control by sabotaging the system from within. These women will not succeed in destroying men's fighting spirit with feminist propaganda and lies. There is no wage gap fucking liars.",-0.7781,106

Women in the west fighting for equality for women in the west. What about inclusivity ? Western liberal feminism at its peak.
