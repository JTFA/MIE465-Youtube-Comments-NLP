"Hey Camila, I'm a big fan of yours. I'm just gonna say something that all of us Camilizers have been wanting to say! Please release Only Told The Moon! It might seem like a lot, but that song is AMAZING! You don't even have to release a studio version, the one you made with GarageBand is already PERFECT!!! And if you don't feel comfortable releasing it on iTunes and all that, maybe just release it on YouTube, as an audio video. At least it gets a proper album cover and it won't have to be called an 'unreleased' song. 

It's all up to you though, I was just saying what all of us would have wanted!

Love 
Anika",0.9716,136

I have actual tears right now I just can’t believe this you are at number one CAMILA is amazing it was the first album I had ever pre ordered I just remember the first time I saw you preform I was at home watching the radio Disney music awards 2014 and I saw this group of girls and loved them but for some reason my eyes went straight to the middle of the stage and I saw this amazing beautiful girl and I was just like who on earth is that I went on my iPad and Googled it like u do and found out the her name was Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao and ever since that day have stuck with her through this amazing journey and I would not regret one day of it the day the album came out was a school day so I woke up at about 6am and listens to it by first period I knew all the lyrics my friends were shocked I remember not eating lunch and just listen to it Camila is my idol she is just amazing her vocals are everything I also love to song and last year I loser my confidence on stage because of a little voice crack and screeching the position of the microphone was of and I was so nervous I later listened to a recording and lost all confidence but then I heard real friends and Havana and never be the same and I would just listen to them and whenever I listen to I have questions I cry just Camila u have been such a good influence I just love you so much I know you probably won’t see this I just hope you do read this and I hope to meet you one day and maybe even be friends idk that’s just my imagination but yeah bye congratulations and love u🦋❤️,0.9978,327

Maria Mercedes hahahahahahahahaha....LOL dude. First of all Camren shippers are not all delusional cause they judge mainly from behavior and body language. A person can say whatever they want in an interview. It's not always necessarily true lol. Also you do know that if a celebrity has a different sexual orientation than heterosexual their management will do everything possible to hide that right? Look at Lauren - she managed to hide it for almost 4 years but her true fans especially LGBT fans knew all along that something was up. I mean ....wake up lol 😂😂 don't believe everything u hear it's for your own good 😂😂,0.6412,118
