BULLSHIT!  Gianni Versace grew up in Sicily where everyone was apart of the mafia. The mafia came to Versace and asked him to launder money through his business. He did as he felt he had no choice. He didn't want to do it anymore and the mafia killed him. Left a dead white dove near his body. Cut me a break!
