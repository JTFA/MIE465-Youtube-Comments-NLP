"April 20, 2018 is going to be the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting. If you are in high school or college, there is going to be a nation-wide school walkout in protest to mass shootings. At 10 AM, leave class, stand outside your school and peacefully protest. Make some noise. It’s time to let them know our safety matters.

"Many existing laws infringe on our right to keep and bear arms.  Quite rightly, citizens have no right to own stinger missiles, .50 caliber machine guns, or attack helicopters, even if they promise to bring them every time to the National Guard drills.  I have no problem with citizens owning every type of weapon in existence when the Bill of Rights was adopted.  I think the question of legality of everything developed since then should be open to regulation based on its potential benefits verses its potential harms.

I certainly don't believe that the founding fathers intended to protect my right as a private citizen to own a machine that has only one function (aside from easing my anxiety about the size of my man bits), and that is to turn human beings into hamburger at a rate of nearly 100 kids a minute.


A favorite NRA line is that guns are necessary to resist a corrupt and oppressive government.  Fortunately, there are still a few ways to keep the cold, dead hands off from around the necks of the politicians now in power, and the young people leading the way (smarter and more articulate than I ever was) are going, I think, to find ways to do it.  I, for one, have voted for the last time for any candidate who accepts contributions from the gun lobby.",-0.8555,253

Those of us who were actually in high school during the Columbine shooting learned pretty quick that the government doesn’t give a shit about us until after a tragedy that can be turned into a media frenzy happens and they can push an agenda with it. We learned first-hand about McCarthyism when our friends were pulled out of assemblies by federal agents and then they started looking for us because we “had that look.” Not the color of our skin, but our perceived social status. Ignore race, gender, sexuality, and all that bullshit; just watch for who starts asking for money and attention before the blood cools on the hallway tiles, that’s your villain.",-0.9839,143
