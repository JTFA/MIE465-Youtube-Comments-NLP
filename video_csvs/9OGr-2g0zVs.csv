"Frank Dickmeis noticed, in this instance, to me seems as if it is simply being procived for a short amount of time such as a one hit wonder; you can get the short about of fame from being noticed once but you dont get fame from simply being noticed a few times, you only get a small portion. When youre known its much more grandiose; something that seems almost proud. Everyone is aware of you, everyone will know who you are at all point because you are know not just simply noticed. 


That was my thought process😊",0.8594,107
