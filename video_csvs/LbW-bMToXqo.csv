"I came here to have a look because some people were saying she was shite and to give up singing, she's ok, not as bad as some of the things I've read about this performance.

It's a shame almost all musical performances on TV are mimed but I like seeing Kylie out there promoting and looking so happy to do it. I really hope I can get a good ticket for the Golden tour when they go on sale. Been a fan since 1988 but never managed to see her live.,0.9754,59

I am also appealing their copyright ban worldwide ban on the fantastic medley at the end of the show!
Maybe if they has sold adverts for the breaks in stead of promoting crap shows to fill the gap they would have they let BOTH these videos  stay in the public domain for ALL!! (I would suggest downloading quickly in case the verdict goes against me and they are withdrawn)",-0.3129,99

"You think the Ant & Dec was voice enhanced? really? What planet are you on? Other than on recordings, which are intended to have high production values, Kylie hasn't ever used any enhancing technology in her live performances - find one where she has and do share. She doesn't profess to be Aretha Franklin, never has and never will but nonetheless she has an enormous back catalogue of hits to her name - you don't achieve that without a degree of talent - she's unique, has a unique voice and is instantly recognisable for who she is. Rather than repeatedly rip this woman apart in public, why not celebrate a woman who has had the strength and audacity to make it in the music business and sustain a career for over 30 years, has had the grace and class to do it without shock or bad behaviour, a breast cancer survivor and a genuinely nice woman that has the respect of many, many people - people who do not dole out respect without merit.  If you don't like the way she sounds, the way she looks or whatever other ridiculous picky nonsense you can think of, this should not mean that she has no right to perform or live her life as she sees fit. Plenty of people love Kylie and enjoy her tours and performances. If you do not, fine. Why would you even be looking at her and commenting?",0.9602,262
