Carlos Inda the new Marlins owners do have money but they weren't going to be winning anytime soon. They lost their best pitcher in Jose Fernandez and Stantons contract was so overpriced it was going to hurt the team where they couldn't sign anyone good. Their attendance still wasn't good even though they had one of the best players and Stanton has a history of injuries. The Dodgers still have a huge payroll and they are saving money this year so next off-season they can go over the luxury tax with a less penalty and go after the big free agents since their weren't any this year.

No offense to ""South Florida,"" but outside of the U, Miami sports fans are fair-weather fans. There isn't a single credible curated best American pro sports fanbases list that has Miami fans, let alone Marlins fans at the top of said list. What are you five? Do you hear, Dbacks, A's, Reds, Padres or Brewers fans (all who are bottom 5 in payroll year in and year out) complain childishly about slashing payroll ever...NO! Ever seen the movie Moneyball know-it-all? 4 out of the 5 teams I just mentioned all made the playoffs in the last 5 years without as large of a payroll as the Marlins. Baseball is a sport that can be successfully orchestrated with saber metrics and good on field management. At the end of the day, the Marlins weren't doing anything with Stanton so they to got rid of his gigantic Salary to slash overhead. At the end of the day, we live in a capitalistic world that's all about dollars and cents. And you know what doesn't make sense Le Batard? Paying a guy 300 million dollars while still not winning.",0.7301,249
"Dan Le Batard is just being too emotional. People just don't show up to home games. They had the NL MVP on their team this year and they had one of the worst attendance numbers this year. The team has also been stuck in the same win mark the last 4 years. 70+ wins each of the last 4 years. Last time they had a winning season was 2009 and last time they won 80 games was 2010. The team has only broken 2 million+ in attendance twice, one when they had their big free agent spending in 2012, and when they won in 1997. And this year was their highest payroll ever, with them having Stanton, people didn't show up. I read the team lost $50 million this year. The team hasn't progressed in terms of wins, people aren't showing up to the games even though they have Stanton, and the team is losing money. You have no choice but to cut payroll because you're not going to spend the kind of money that was spent to buy the team and be going in there thinking if we lose money than so be it.

Besides not having partners or himself with Jeter with the deep pockets after getting the team from Lauria IMO is the main reason for the Stanton trade this soon. I would have waited until the mid season trade deadline of 8/1/18 myself for better offers myself. There should another concern for Marlins fans and that is. Jeter's lack of experience as a GM/Executive. It's much hard IMO to become a MLB executive with NO PRIOR experience and be successful than it is to be a on field skipper and win. Bob Brenly won a world series as a skipper with no prior experience as a coach ,etc with the Diamondbacks. 
It's early but Jeter being hammered on this trade is fair. And FYI. Blood's comment above is brilliant counter point on the pluses Jeter and the new Miami Ownership made in an otherwise crappy situation.  Miami is the worst big city in America for the less passionate sports fans.

I agree and sympathize with almost everything you have said and I would think the new ownership would as well. But if they let that interfere with how they decided to proceed in developing a winning baseball team with what they had to work with when they took over this pattern would never end. The Marlins needed a reboot if there was any hope of winning in the future and that is what these new owners are doing. It sucks that it will be another 4-5 years but it is what it is. It is not the fans fault or the new owners that this organization has been poorly run for many years.

"I don't think they would have gotten better offers mid season. Stanton has that no trade clause so he could easily just do what he did to the Giants and Cardinals trade and veto them and they would be stuck. If they were going to hold on to him and didn't make the deal with the Yankees I would just wait until the next off season because a lot of people will be going for Harper and Machado, and they can use that as leverage to get a better deal from teams who miss out on those two guys.

Kevin Clements you’re right. A’s fans are REAL baseball fans. I’m still waiting for a single Marlins supporter to come up with an argument that has some real substance to it. I hear this remedial nonsense about how garbage the ownership has been and the team hasn’t been good for years now. Not once do I hear any talk about the 2 rings they won. Clearly that confirms that most people in Miami didn’t appreciate them. I really question Marlins fans knowledge of their own team. They’ve had elite players come and go. HOF caliber players and all I hear is a bunch of crybabies acting like none of that happened. Now I just sit back and wait for Marlins fans to call me names since they have no real arguments or substance in their dialogue.

"What a bunch of sour grapes from Dan Le Batard. He was wrong when he said “You are starting off the interview with a lie.” The Miami Marlins are doing what they have to do to fix their financial situation because Jeffery Loria and Dave Samson put the organization in this situation when they screwed the tax payers when they were investing money in their new ballpark at that time. Also, the criticism aimed at Derek Jeter and the Miami Marlins is not fair because the Miami Marlins have not played a game under the new ownership. Marlins fans are acting like their team never won a World Series before. They won it all in 1997 & 2003. They haven’t been to the playoffs since 2003. Not acceptable, I know. But understand that the Marlins are a small market team and they have not been run very well at all. I understand that Marlins fans are hurt because star players are being traded once again. This time, this one has to be done for what is best for the team. Giancarlo Stanton was signed to a big contract that was not a good one. It’s a scary contract. You don’t give a guy a 13-year contract when he’s had a history of being injured. Last year was his first full season without injuries. Plus, Stanton was unhappy in Miami because the team wasn’t winning. The Marlins have bigger needs than needing a guy that is gonna hit 50+ home runs. That’s a one in a lifetime talent. They traded Marcell Ozuna, who is now a superstar in baseball. They traded Dee Gordon. They are trading away players because they want to win. The Marlins are not in any position to win right now. Maybe in 5 years, baseball will be back on the map in Miami. But right now, they are rebuilding, which they should do.",-0.7357,365

Why does ESPN not address the first issue of the 2005 November American Journal of Sports Medicine findings of the Commissioner Bud Seligs order to measure the loss of range of motion 33 major league baseball pitchers throwing arms elbow joints against the non-throwing arms elbow joints range of motion?

Why doesn't ESPN address the fact that MLB/YOUTUBE now collude to openly create disability in all the baseball players so they can steal away sll their vareer goals and ambitions by contractually enforced use of pitching and swinging motion impostors teachings creatinf permanent injury? You giys all feed of their falures. Children and adults now even the mlbpa {small case} tear up those contracts and use motions that do not allow owners to throw away players they've instructed there team physicians use bone dissolving steroids playing under performance forms were instituted so their personal venture status remains intact even against manfreds public statement on Television baseball in the MLB/USA is big business.

You cant add to team that isn’t willing to put the money up to do it. Honestly maybe the fan base needs to put more butts in the seats and stop complaining about it. Support your team more and maybe more money revenue generated can help your team put money around the team to help it get better. Im sorry i understand drafting is important but the reality is your not gonna always be lucky in the sport of baseball its like-football in a sense you have to be able to hit and get the right players on these picks.Then use the money you got to build around the team thats how it works.,0.8779,120

When the stadium got built and they doubled their payroll which put them in top 10 in payroll, they ranked 18th in attendance. You can say it's the owner, and I get the feeling as though you've been fleeced, but people weren't showing up even when they did spend and were winning. I mean this season was the highest payroll they ever had, and you had the MVP in your lineup, but didn't show up.",0.7114,110

"heatfan53 yes 2003 is one of the years. The Marlins won the World Series and only two teams had a worse attendance record than the Marlins that year. And when your team last had a winning record in 09, only the Athletics had a lower attendance record record. Hell, in 2012 when they went on the big spending spree in 2012 that had the Marlins with a top 10 payroll, and they only ranked 18th in attendance.",0.1779,85
