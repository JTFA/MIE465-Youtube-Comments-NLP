"if you put a music producer, an actor and a comedian as judges for competition of professional basketball players' dunk contest. Thats what you will get. So, I am a pro basketball player, I worked my ass off to become where I am and I want to make myself a name showcasing my talent. Instead of being judged by pros who won the contest before or were known with their great careers in the NBA, I get 3 people who no connection to the league other than getting a promotion deal with the NBA for their own crafts (which are announced when they were introduced). To me this is disrespectful to all the players who competed/won in previous years. Because they had to impress judges who were actually understood/related to difficulties of their dunks. This was commercial move by the NBA, to make more money. I think, fans should be refunded for 1/3 of their tickets. Hopefully, some of you will agree me on this. Very bad decision by whoever allowed this!",0.8806,196
