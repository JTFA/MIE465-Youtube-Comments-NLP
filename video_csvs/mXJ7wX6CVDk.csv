I wanted to see more of the Thorgy I saw in this short clip. She is hilarious. In her season the producers made her whole storyline revolve around Bob. In this season she only got to episode 2. Not only is she entertaining she is actually an amazing entertainer. Given the amount of genuine talent she possess I think Thorgy could have easily made top three. I don't think she ever had a chance at winning though because it's a reality show at the end of the day and they want winners who appeal to the straight teenage girls who are boosting the ratings rather than represent the best of drag.,0.9854,118

"Let me explain a narrative: Thorgy knew that the show already has a script with a few queens slotted for the win, I mean it's not really a secret now. She suspected that she herself is a ""throwaway piece"". They were told to prepare for their Diva look, so she did of course, gladly probably because she loves Stevie. But then, HERE IN THIS ROOM ON THIS DAY is where they actually get their written parts, their Ru song, everything: and she noticed how Shangela and BenDela for example had comedy practically wrote into their parts. So she suspected that she was going to be the throwaway piece this episode, and she got nervous. She mentioned this to the other girls because she now has this suspicion, but she's still hoping that she can do some things to change her fate. Nope, during her practice she realized that she wasn't cast into the background, as if she was just being sidelined, so she tried to change that and tried to rebel against the script. But nothing really could've been done, the show was determined to get rid of her. She hoped that Shangela and BenDela could've saved her, and Shangela mentioned an alliance giving her hope --- but nope, in the end she still got to pack. That's why she said ""ah, gross"". Think about that feeling if my narrative is true. As in, that's how Thorgy felt. Anyone would've felt ""gross"" at that point, not really ""mad at the show"" per se because they all kinda knew that there is a general script to the show, but at the same time you'd just feel like a powerless chicken waiting to be slaughtered as that pointy finger of death landed on you, struggled hard, but eventually was still chopped. The fact that you saw it coming but could do nothing about it. She was angry at Shangela, because 1) she gave her hope right as she was about to accept her fate, heightening it just to put it down again. 2) Shangela is not clueless, none of the girls are, so Shangela probably knows that she has the script going for her too. And she ""turned a blind eye to fate destroying someone else because fate is on my side"", so to speak. Not saying that's what Shangela's doing, but that's what Thorgy would've felt. Had Thorgy seen how Kennedy said ""there are some things that are not worth losing for just 100000 dollars"", she'd feel a lot better --- I mean, Shangela did not have a choice, and she was JUST telling Thorgy that ""at the end of the day, it's a competition even though Kennedy and I are friends"". Shangela probably felt quite shitty too but she was without options at that point.

There, makes sense now everyone? Why she said she'd do Stevie and she loves Stevie but at the same time it is ""setup to fail her""? It's not the character that gave her that feeling. It's the actual performance that they only learned AFTER they got on the show. And obviously no, they did not know which song and what exactly they were going to do, or Kennedy couldn't possibly mess up the lyrics that badly.

Also, why did she chose to represent Stevie from her understanding instead of playing it up? Imagine if the show was already planning to get rid of her. If she played it up, the judges would've said ""that does not fit Stevie. Is Stevie a comedy queen or a dramatic diva? No. Stevie is spiritual. Stevie is internal. And you didn't capture her essence"". And us audience will of course say ""oh yeah, that critique is ON POINT! And Thorgy call herself a Stevie fan, she doesn't even get Stevie!"" So, in such insane confusion and pressure, she chose to represent faithfully what she, a Stevie fan, understood her icon as.",0.9514,757
"Like Trixie said, she COULD have made Stevie a little witchy or SOMETHING, it's up to them to make it FUN it's DRAG (also a tv show). There's a time and place for realness (Natural woman Latrice Royale etc.) this was not it. I LOVED her final lewk tho",0.0545,58
