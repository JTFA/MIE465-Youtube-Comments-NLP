"I'm going to break this down for you all to understand.  Driver fatigue is a minor symptom of the underlying disease here.  First problem here is, receivers. The receivers, in an effort to cut costs while maintaining a profit, need to keep inventory low, and thus requires their suppliers to send a certain amount of product at a certain time to be delivered ""Just in time"" or JIT, to continue production. So, the shipper of said product works in conjunction with the trucking company to deliver that product JIT. In an effort to maximize their profit, the trucking company makes judgments on how long it takes for it's driver to deliver that product from point A to point B.  After several loads of this, the trucking company attempts to push it's driver to do it quicker or sooner, so they can utilize that driver on another load, regardless of that drivers fatigue.  This JIT load may have been only 100-200 miles, so the trucking company can put that driver on a load that is going another 100-200 miles down the road, never considering it may have taken the receiver 2 hours or more to unload the driver. So, the drivers are pushed daily to make 500-600 miles a day or more. So lets break-down a trucks potential. Hypothetically, a truck governed at 65mph on a straight and flat highway, with full fuel, and no obstacles, can do 715 miles in an 11 hour period without stopping.  Unfortunately, there are no such highways like that, probably in the whole world.  I can just about guarantee that.  So, drivers are confronted with traffic, weather, hills, and regulations. Trucking companies, receivers, and shippers do not take into account, nor do they care, all of these hurdles that a driver has to contend with. An OTR driver, with a load going more than 100 miles, is almost guaranteed to cross AT LEAST 2 D.O.T. scales, and depending on the route he/she has to follow, could be 3 or more scales in that first 100 miles in many places.  So to say, even on a good day, with co-operative traffic, good weather, and mostly open roads, the driver is going to be lucky, very lucky, to do 600 miles on a long haul. Many trucking companies won't haul long loads, as it ties up a truck for too long. Doing away with JIT freight, will eliminate a lot of driver fatigue, even if not doing away with it, being understanding of the situations that a driver has to deal with along the way, will help.  JIT freight is just a very bad idea.  Any manufacturer should always, ALWAYS, keep at least 2-3 days worth of product in-house to prevent an issue, depending of course, on where their supplier must ship from.  I have to ask, is a near empty warehouse worth anyones life?  The life you save, may be that of your children.",0.8777,569
I'm not a trucker but I sympathize with truckers completely. If it wasn't for truckers this country would literally come to a standstill. Super markets would completely run out of food within 1 to 2 weeks. Restaurants and fast food would have to shut down for lack of food.

That's not the only problem that eld's create eld's Force the driver to face a time limit on their work day for how much money they can make so what you wind up having is a driver who wakes up in the morning goes to work and from the minute he jumps in his truck he's driving like he has a gun to the back of his head because he has to get at least two or three loads in throughout the day at least in my case to make enough money to justify the workday because that's another fun thing about eld's once that computer makes you clock off for the day you can't do any other work and if you didn't get your run finished by the end of payroll you won't see the money for that run until your next payday eld's put unnecessary pressure on drivers which forces them to make unsafe decisions to justify making enough money to keep working their job drivers will drive more risky through traffic drivers will drive faster than they should in a certain speed limit area,0.6772,187

If that's the case Intermodal transport needs to be the standard but with over the road making up a small fraction

One could easily carry Freight via Airship or rail due to both of those vehicles already capable of safely operating as an autonomous vehicle

The only thing semis would be used for in that scenario is for the 1st and final miles unlike now

What happens is if let's say for example a truck driver already drove for 11 hours and is driving a robot control truck in other words it means self-driving truck and what happened to the drivers on break in the back and the middle of nowhere somewhere car comes flying into the truck haha haha guess what he can't even the drivers on break huh he can't do anything if he takes over the wheel he's in violation to stop the accident idiot he's in violation moron DMV moron I know a lot of people will support me with this but please do your homework before commenting and and then I'm looking forward to hearing your comments what will happen is being the robots are actually taking over the robot situation in an emergency well guess what's going to happen if the drivers are afraid of losing his job situation if I would be so anyway just a repeat what I said I would rather let the car crash into the truck instead of being a violation you're telling me that in emergency situation I can't drive the truck because I'm past my 11 hours the hell wouldn't let the roll. Take care of it and whatever happens happens even though I'm not a truck driver even though I'm not a truck driver and again I'm not a truck driver I am opposed to this type of things cuz what will happen is being that robots are coming in and taking over and it still needs to be human present in the truck but human passes 11 hours of driving and he can't take over the truck being as an emergency situation in the front excuse me that's absurd and being that everyone is going driverless but there still be a driver with a license in the truck I hope to drive and then emergency situation but again he's passes 11 hours of driving so then what God forbid to the emergency God forbid should there be an emergency in a self-driving truck and a driver's past 11 hours of driving God forbid please do your homework before commenting thanks,-0.9753,361
