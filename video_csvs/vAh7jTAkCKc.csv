Hate to say it but until she does her body just a bit she’ll stay underrated. The world sucks cause she’s fucking beautiful and talented and this song SHOULD BE A HIT. But I think that’s what she’s lacking in this day. A little more butt then the industry would soak her all up. But I’d rather her keep grinding. Dancing on way to fireeeeee,0.7926,80

Got on my wrist the Titanic (yah)
Could ride on this shit like a Benji (rah)
Get high on the perky and Xanny (ha)
From the bottom of the jet to Miami (Dubai)
When the chopper start kickin' it's damaged
Got Patek on her wrist and her panties (Patek)
Ain't no drama
In the back of my Maybach on coffee
Yeah, iced out summers (ooh)
Invite your main bitch to a slumber
My money long, out there yonder
Fat ass with a flat stomach (flat)
Baguette glass cost a whole hundred (baguette)
The coupe fast, doin' two hundred
