So at lunch today I was talking to basically the whole table and was laughing while saying how this kid made fun of me having acne as a joke and I think it's harmless and funny. So another one of my friends laughs at that and then I literally turn to my friend that I tease and who teases me and just say something completely innocent and random ""You have a zit but I have a lot."" Literally the girl that was laughing earlier goes ""You know that's really mean😐"" and I just say ""Okay it's not mean if the person I'm saying it to is not offended."" (my friend wasn't offended I asked her) Just oh my gosh and this isn't the first time it's happened before and it's like the millionth time it's happened. And my friend and I were joking around and she said I had no common sense and I said she didn't have any common sense and my other friend goes ""Oh my gosh chillll"" and I'm trying to explain to her we tease each other and she goes ""Just stop."" Yeah I'm sorry I just had to rant because it really is annoying when people can't stay out of other people's business.",0.9804,250
