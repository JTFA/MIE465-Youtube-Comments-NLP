I wish there was a love button for this because I agree with you completely. She doesn't need a damn gimmick at all. She cares SO much about her fans. You can tell who she is a fan of by just doing what is right for her. Reba is one of her idols and had been for a long time. <3 She has that sass of Janis and the power of Aretha..

Seriously she has one of the most unique voices today. She doesn't need a gimmick. The quality of her voice alone is very unique.",-0.6124,81
