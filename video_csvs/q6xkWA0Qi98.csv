"Alright since there's lots of comments saying they took the idea from door monster let me just say that's rather unlikely actually since writing, producing, planning, filming and editing something like this needs a whole lot of time I'm guessing they're now already working on a new video that we won't see before april or may, most of the time it's a case of creation overlap aka by coincidence two unrelated parties come up with similar ideas around the same time and end up releasing their finished product almost simultaneously with the other 
you see if you have an original video idea (so nothing like a challenge or a tag where ppl are supposed to do the same things as other creators) you'd google/research the heck out of it to make sure there's no one out there who has already done it like this
Now of course I cant be 100% certain that that is what happened here but it's usually an 8/10 kinda thing, also I trust jack and dean enough to think they'd include credits if they had been inspired by said door monster video, they've been on the platform long enough and know how terribly annoying it is to have your content copied by someone else",0.8586,221
