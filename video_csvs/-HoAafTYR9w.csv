People (including innocent children) are being molested, raped, tortured and killed at the cloning centers. These cloning centers are located in Deep Underground Military Bases. For example, Area 51 (which is located in Lincoln County, Nevada), Dulce Base (which is located in Dulce, New Mexico) and Montauk Base (which is located in Montauk, New York). Many of these bases have a cloning floor and that cloning floor is called a cloning center. Some cloning centers are above ground though. There‚Äôs an above ground cloning center somewhere in western Canada, which Queen Elizabeth owns. She knows where the cloning center in Canada is and so does the former Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. Queen Elizabeth, Vladimir Putin and high-up Chinese people pretty much RUN the cloning centers. In addition, Kevin Sullivan (ex-pro wrestler) is a rich, satanic cloner with a lot of pull with the Illuminati. Please help free those that are trapped at the cloning centers.

When one ""sells their soul"", it means that they agreed for the Illuminati to use a clone of them at the cloning centers for sex (or whatever) while they're asleep in exchange for fame and fortune. 

Illuminati Secrets: Human Cloning, Cloning Centers, Vril Lizards, Parasited Hosts Of Vril (aka Drones), The Soulstone Microchip and Chipheads.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vril type 1 lizards (terrestrial aliens) are parasitic, carnivorous and malevolent. They‚Äôre about one to two feet tall. Their head resembles the body of a king crab and their body is covered in red diamond-shaped scales. They dwell underground. They‚Äôre dumb (and are able to talk) but smarter when they turn a human into a host (drone). They have a proboscis (called the Quill), which is located on the top of their head. The proboscis (which looks-like a chocolate chip) contains everything that the lizard is (its consciousness). Their lizard body is dead once the proboscis leaves its body. They can only do this once in their lifetime and if they fail (turning a human into a host), they die. The human that is about to be bodysnatched is either unconscious or restrained. The proboscis enters the human‚Äôs eye and spirals around the optic nerve. It then proceeds to go to an area of the brain (driven by taste) that tastes like butterscotch to them. Then, they do a feeling of holding your breath and pushing outwards. Finally, it does what's called ‚ÄúSweating the Quill‚Äù (at the tip of the proboscis), which excretes the parasitic cells that take over the human body. This kills the human and replaces their consciousness with the Vril lizard‚Äôs consciousness. The Vril lizard becomes that human (after about a month‚Äôs recovery time).

This transition from Vril lizard to human is what‚Äôs called ""Droning"". Once a Vril lizard becomes a human, they are then known as a Drone, Host of Vril or a Parasited Host. A person that has had this happen to them, may be referred to as someone that had been possessed by a demon. This is what demonic possession is. In addition, some hosts of Vril (drones) call themselves ‚Äúwalk-ins‚Äù, in which they describe how an alien consciousness or soul took over their body.

The slit-eye videos that you see all over the web are fake. The Illuminati put these out intentionally to mislead everyone into thinking that one can tell who is a ‚Äúreptilian‚Äù (Vril lizard and a host of Vril aka drone) by checking to see, if their eyes turn to slits. This doesn‚Äôt occur and they cannot do this. However, the eyes ARE one way to tell... Sometimes, there may be an eye that pops outward (or inward) due to the droning process or it makes the eye stray, so it looks-like the person is cockeyed or walleyed. There is no shape-shifting either. The so-called shape-shifting is the transition from Vril lizard to human. Those that talk about ‚Äúreptilian shape-shifters‚Äù are referring to Vril and people who have been droned.

Drones (Parasited Hosts of Vril) mimic human behavior. They are willing slaves with no compassion and only care about droning other people, torture and sex. They‚Äôre murderers. They killed the human to ""use"" their body and live life as them... as a human.

"It's partially easy access to guns and the types of guns that can be modified to be fully automatic. ¬† ¬†They are STILL going to have problems with crazy people getting access to guns and people modifying certain types to be fully automatic, so to prevent a school or any public place for that matter is more than just getting better security. ¬†Are we going to have more security at ALL public places all of the time? ¬†That's impossible. ¬†It's already expensive for most schools to have increased security, let alone at every public place and are we supposed to live in a society where everywhere you go there's an armed security guard, and LE constantly checking to see if we have any weapons?

Who's running this country? ¬† WE, the people, or the NRA? ¬†So far, the NRA is running this country and those A-holes are funded by the gun/bullet mfg. to lobby for laws to protect THEM and their ability to sell more and to raise the level of paranoia so that more people buy weapons and bullets.

Sorry, but NO WHERE in the 2nd Amendment does it state that anyone should be allowed to own and carry a weapon.


If you READ the 2nd Amendment, it's states that those that belong to a WELL REGULATED MILITIA for the security of a free state. ¬†Individuals does NOT constitute a well regulated militia.

WHat's been happening is the NRA and gun owners completely take the portion of the 2nd amendment out of context and they repeatedly say ""we have the right to bear arms"", yet they dismiss the other IMPORTANT verbiage in the 2nd amendment that Specifies WHO.

When the 2nd Amendment was approved, they didn't have the LE, Military that we have now, so back then, if there was a situation, then individuals would have to come forward bearing arms to protect out country, but since we have Military and LE, that's who has those rights and anyone else is more of a privilege, just like getting a driver's license. ¬†They can take that privilege away and they can ban certain weapons off the approved list. ¬†They should also change the laws to make it where you have to get psychological evaluations done on a routine basis, just like LE has to go through, and they should clamp down on the buying/selling process to prevent guns getting into the wrong hands. ¬†Until they do something pretty drastic, we are always going to have situations where a shooter loads up on ammunition and various weapons and does public shootings.

Chirstopher Dorner was ex-military, ex-LE and he was a member of the NRA, yet he went crazy and shot a bunch of people and eventually committed suicide. So, it's cases like these school shootings, shootings at malls, movie theaters, concerts, etc. etc. ¬†Because there are so many guns that have been sold and distributed for many decades, it will take a while to clean it up, but they have to make some severe changes, otherwise, we are still going to have public shootings from time to time and anyone that's not behind any changes to the gun laws is just a stupid F'ing idiot.
¬†

To the rest of the world, this country looks like a bunch of idiots with too many guns. ¬†Other countries have drastically different gun laws and they don't have anywhere near the amount of pubic shootings that our country has unless it's by terrorists. ¬†We have ""terrorists' both foreign and domestic.

So, unti they change the gun laws and start clamping down, be afraid every day of the rest of your life because anyone can pull a gun at any time and start shooting and it will take at least 15 minutes or longer for LE to get there, but by that time, it will be too late. ¬†

What's laughable is they had someone armed at that school, but they didn't do anything about it. ¬†Probably too scared. ¬†

I'm not in favor of teachers having weapons, it's not part of their job, nor are they adequately trained, experienced to do much, ¬†Even if they were ex-miiarty or ex-LE, they still would have to constantly be trained and that's just not a viable solution.",-0.952,783

No one will be able to react fast enough to stop someone like that. You honestly think shootings work like in western movies where someone is always a quick draw. I suppose the coach who got shot shielding his students would have been just find if he had a handgun? BS. If you've ever been in a firefight, you'd know things aren't that simple.

"jacksonvillebounce I'm guessing you've never even seen a real gun? There's this thing, it's called gun safety and, when implemented, prevents the possibility of a student or anyone other than the owner from getting access to that gun. There may be a chance for more injury, anything's possible, but I would rather take my chances behind someone pointing a gun at the person shooting at kids than behind someone being shot down, knowing im next. Not to mention, do you not think whoever was wielding the gun would have properly been trained? This isn't the wild west. And I find your comment implying teachers would take an ""I don't get paid enough for that"" attitude in this situation.. I think most teachers are the EXACT type of person to sign up to protect their students. Are you fucking kidding me? The very fact that they went into the educational career field, knowing the pay is way less than the work and overtime they invest at a school, shows the very altruism of these individuals. How disgusting of you to suggest that most teachers wouldn't risk themselves for a child; the very fact that a COACH threw himself in front of the students being shot at during the parkland shooting shows you have absolutely no understanding for human compassion",-0.6726,239
kids yall need to be careful on how your trying to take action there are so twisted people that would what ever they can to get dems back in power if there was a gun control and less guns in america the evil fuckers would have a all out ball game and openly kill as many as possible Americans will bleed then there are ones willing to go that far number one reason hillary lost to start this comment and if anyone is  reading this show the world what im saying i love this country and i will always be thankful for our country to be where it is if there was no guns more blood shed in our streets and the young ones that had to indoor the horrible event in Florida had to happen the way it did yall kids need to stop saying its trumps fault its like trump told that kid that killed 17 kids to kill as many as you can then get back to me and then ill pay you i mean come on yall kids need to stop and realize as ill say welcome to America united we stand divided we fall i cant even imagine how things would be in 10 years from today the left is playing out these incidents and just sitting back and waiting patiently to make there next move in all the wrong places just because hillary loosing not once but twice thats has a reason for that to accure you kids need to be carful on what you say because there are some crazy ass individuals that dont give a fuck plus anti Americans if guns where banned there will be a large amount of blood shed in America then the ones that could have used a gun to protect there familys to be gunned down after breaking into peoples homes and kill familys and get away with it cause there would not be able to track down guns in bad i mean bad peoples hands then what how would yalk kids to handle that protesting dosent allways work like that you kids should be a little more honest with reality is that to hard to handel wake up yall not the only people in this world with issues look at war islamic countries come hear to put there agenda in our faces its not trumps fault why dont all you kids sit down and ask obama questions on why he never did anything while terroist where killing Americans very easy bombs in boston marathon and goes back to the Busch era about 911 you kids need to carefully think deeply on what you may show on how you feel and see as one coming together and tackle the main goals and stop making it seem like we have no choice to take away the second amendment watch if this takes place which i hope to god this horrible event will fall into the laps on democrats and put the real fear and danger into the ones in America who will never in a life time get the true feeling on being a real american with pride and that will be me im a real American and i will never back down to what i believe is right will law and constitution you kids are the future of America i mean do you even see how things have tooken a hard flip on how this country has its ways on handling situations thats why we have to keep thank you for reading this leave comments on how what you think about this so kids stay in school and say no to drugs im 6 years clean i struggled with a addiction problems drank all the time smoked weed everyday for years im surprised my lungs healed after i quite smoking cigarettes i use to drink and drive drink very heavy experimented with coke weed meth herion lsd ecstasy so this killing of 17 innocent students that where killed should have never took place for the young ones these things happen unfortunately in the most tragically plots of someone that would stoop that low to get satisfaction for there own needs to feel normal but ill say it rap music now a days is infecting the minds of millions thats kinda like brain washing humans to hear see taste hold throw keep destroy kill cheat hate fight push take hurt cry pain saftey life death heart bad evil fact lies greed trick plots at the end of the day this is what we are facing its like there shoving this into peoples eyes to maybe not wanting to see and just live their lives peacefully and share love with familys across this amazing country dont loose a grip on what the American people expect in building lifes not loosing those lives that are closer too we all have heart but sometimes these hearts are being ripped right out of our chest and that cant be replaced once its gone all hope could be less wanting then more wanting be safe peoples and see the light is hear but sometimes you have to search for the light and fight threw the dark god bless America amen also im allmost done expressing my feelings my baby mama put a gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger so i too know how it feels to loose a love one she was my all and she left me with my daughter and her baby boy from another father not being able to not spend time with her mom so we all have loved lost ones see not just the schools its every where its an not wanting event to have to live with i too suffer from this and ill never forget
