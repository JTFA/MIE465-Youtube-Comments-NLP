Slow as face id(have to look at the screen before unlock)
On screen fps( have to look at the location on fps before u can touch the fps accurately)

At least face id has something like more secure to say but this on screen fps is useless and mostly unnecessary gimmick for phone.

Al these people get excited for a unnecessary slower solution.

Go innovate and implement fps on power button like the side fps on sony is way better and faster solution. 

Put security aside, in term of convenience:
Fps on side power button > rear/front fps> face id > on screen fps",0.9762,182
