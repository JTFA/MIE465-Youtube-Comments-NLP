I honestly thought that the stories of Fates: Birthright and Awakening, up to 2/3 in, were alright.It's just that it seems like the players prioritized shipping over the games themselves where it wasn't needed as opposed to  Genealogy where it did... a lot.

"Where's that Fire Emblem Seisen no Keifu remake Nintendo? You know , Genealogy of the Holy War? Surely you havn't forgotten about the ""Holy Grail of Fire Emblem"", the game with the best written and darkest story in the series, remember? It's been 22 years already guys, and you may not know this but here in the west we've been waiting a good 15 years for this game period. I want to see what you guys can do with the Switch's engine on a classic Fire Emblem game, I want to see the land of Jugdral on an even grander scale than you managed on the SNES, and I think we all want to see the ""Barhara Massacre"" in a glorious HD cutscene. I for one would also love a Thracia 776 DLC game add-on (Like you did in Fates with Revelations), but I'd honestly be happy with just a retelling of my favorite Fire Emblem epic. This needs to happen Nintendo. Before Fates 2.0, before a Binding Blade remake, before you guys screw up again with another ""Waifu Emblem"" like Fates and Awakening, you guys need to remake this game and show this new audience what a true Fire Emblem game is. Sure it could be argued that Echoes: Shadows of Valentia already did this and they would have a valid point but most of the story and wrighting in Echoes was completely new because Gaiden's story was about as bare-boned as a Bonewalker. Please don't let the Americanization ruin fan favorite parts again like they did leaving Alm's infamous line ""Don't worry, Celica. I'll crush these Bastards."" out of Echoes though, retell it truthfully with no child hunt, death, or even incest theme removed. Genealogy invented many staple features in the series thus far and did them right in this game (Weapon Triangle, Marriage, Children, Supports, etc.). And there are also a few things you could fix and add to the game to make it the ultimate Jugdral experience (Money sharing, weapon drops, free trading, that BS GreatShield skill needs to be nerfed, etc.). Please take this post into consideration, Nintendo, and if not, you may as well cast Falaflame on the Fire Emblem series all together.",0.9938,425
