"8.  You can‚Äôt talk BTC without talking a bit about BCash.  And those who support Bcash are at this point frothing at the mouth to scream at me‚Ä¶. But the truth is‚Ä¶. There are already multiple crypto coins that do what Bcash does‚Ä¶ and do it better.  Bcash is where it is currently only because it‚Äôs attempting to steal the brand.  It it were called Btrash, it would be trading at pennies.  If you go back and look at the history of Bitcoin‚Ä¶when it had the same volume of transactions that Bcash has today‚Ä¶it was just as fast‚Ä¶. SO‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a fan of Bcash.  But I am a fan of coins that serve that role better‚Ä¶ I do NOT buy into the narrative that Bitcoin is useless unless you can use it to buy a big mac.  If that were true,",-0.2321,170

"Bitcoin hit a high of $20,000 in 2017 and then the speculators sold out so now as of Feb.2018 it has plunged to $7000.  If you look at a Bitcoin history graph and put a ruler on the LOWS you will see that $7000 is the predictable Low for Bitcoin where as the $20,000/Bitcoin was an artificially high price driven by speculators.  Now is the time to Buy Bitcoin to get a Fair Market Price.  Sure it may dip lower in the near future which is why I would spread my purchases over the next Few Months.

I was up over 3,590%. the truth is that the smaller and unpopular new digital currencies that are rewarding investors with the next round of huge wins. For example, I recently obtained 27,000 coins as advised by my portfolio manager in a tiny new digital currency for just 18.5 cents per coin. Those coins now trade for around $4 each- 1,981% higher. And I invested in another one that's jumped from $1.50 to $10.71. Yet this opportunity is just getting started, today I'll show you the new digital currencies that can turn as little as $10 into over $1million in a blink of an eye. Yes, that's right. a single crispy $10 bill could make you a millionaire. now for the doubters, not only is it possible, it's actually happening at the moment, a huge number of investors worldwide have seen gains of 75,063% in Cryptonite, 59,577% in InfluxCoin, 60,450% in MaxCoin, and even 823,750% in DubaiCoin!

"The fact that bitcoin lacks a ""material base"" is one of the reasons it has so much utility. There is a reason that 99.99% of fiat currency is also digital and thus lacking a ""material base"" . Having a material base means you cannot secure it as well , and you cannot send it over the internet, and it isn't as divisible , and it isn't as durable, and it cannot have a guaranteed scarcity... all aspects that are important for currencies.",0.2177,92

"This is the same for all assets and currencies , but historically even obsolete and ""dead"" currencies still fetch a value  today so anyone who suggests bitcoin can go to 0 automatically discredits themselves.

"To me if crypto currencies do gather real strength governments will see it as a threat to their own currencies and shut it down.  Rendering a countries currency worthless is a big deal.  If we all used bitcoin how would governments function.  They could not print money to pay for government initiated ventures, feed the commercial banking sector and so on.",-0.5423,66
