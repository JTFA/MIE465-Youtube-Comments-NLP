"""The Dreaming Kind""

I turned off the news again tonight
It's getting hard to watch everyone fight
But every time I turn my face
I see the world from outer space
How small we are but look how much we have to waste

So I'm giving it all I got
There'll be no more wasting precious time
I'm giving it all I got
Nothing's ever going to change my mind
That we're beautiful inside
Maybe I'm the dreaming kind

Could you imagine it, if love was blind
If on this earth everybody was kind
Oh what a different world it'd be
If peace was our reality
But how far will we have to fall
Before we meet destiny

So I'm giving it all I got
There'll be no more wasting precious time
So I'm giving it all I got
Nothing's ever going to change my mind
That we're beautiful inside
Maybe I'm the dreaming kind

Every child is pure until he learns to hate
They watch with innocence and imitate
They say that love can conquer all, but there is no time to wait

So I'm giving it all I got
Even if I cannot change a thing
I'm giving it all I got
Gonna fight to keep remembering
That we are beautiful inside
Maybe I'm just the dreaming kind",0.9962,224

"Bill Anthony 
I bet you were cool with the US attacking Afghanistan and Iraq after a group of Saudi citizens flew planes into towers on 9/11. How is that lack of critical thinking of yours working out for the world sixteen years later?  Are you glad we didn‚Äôt question the absurdity of what we were told by authorities?  Are you glad we killed and injured tens of thousands to get rid of those ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction‚Äù that never existed?  Do you have some better info than the rest of the world which you could share with the rest of us so the choices of those in authority appear just and logical?",-0.4696,121
"Bill Anthony 
So there is some hope for you. Just like you did not accept the call to war that the powers that be tried to elicit after 9/11, I also choose to make my own decisions based on the facts presented.  These opinions and decisions usually are counter to the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù views authority and society tell me I should hold. 

Oh well. Good luck with your truth.",0.8367,76
"Bill Anthony 
You are the one lacking critical thinking skills, not me. You are able to completely ignore the word ‚Äúattempted‚Äù in the phrase ‚Äúattempted gun grab.‚Äù  If you recall, Sandy Hoax did result in proposed legislation to restrict rights of gun owners. Although it was unsuccessful at the time, legislation was proposed and voted on by Congress. 

You sound like one of those people who believes any nonsense that a talking head on TV tells you - like that there are over 500 genders instead of just two. Sad that the world has more lemmings like you than people who are willing to speak up when key facts do not align with the official narrative.",-0.9245,129

It would be like me writing a tear jerking song about JFK, if he wasn't truly killed.  Sheryl, tragically, is not immune to the effects of contrived and orchestrated events, despite her seemingly and unwarranted elevated height of conscience.

"To all of you who have been deceived on a level that is comparable, IMO, only to those deceived by the JFK assassination and culpability for 911, this piece by Sheryl Crow is worthy, arguably, for it's musical composition only. It's declared content, the alleged Sandy Hook massacre, never truly took place.  Yea, I know it's a shock to the system folks, but unless you have truly looked closely at all the information available you will continue to be reeled in like a fish on a hook. It's really not that hard to come to the conviction that Sandy Hook was a fairy tale.  To believe it actually happened as advertised you have to ignore so much - too much to relate here.  But hey, if you like the song and like movies, just like all the Disney songs and movies - knock yourself out and live in Wonderland!
