One of the best female voices of all time. As someone said in the comments her voice is effortless..gives chills..absolutely. She's been away too long. This is getting played a lot on UK radio right now I really hope she has a big hit with it. It kicks the Taylor Swift's and Katy Perry's into the dust. A very welcome return and a superb track. Heads up to the producer and writer too..awesome audio and lyrics,0.953,88
