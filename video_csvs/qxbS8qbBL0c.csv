"Remember how every electronic song sounds the same, cause all of them use the same arrangements (claps before chorus, high pitch voices, bla bla bla) well Eddie here got basically a 70's or even older ages of music a got his lyrics in between 
I liked him cause he innovate a lil and I'm a Damien rice fan so I knew when he took a little of him a no body notice 
But this song just... Amm is just not good 
For me, cause it's a solid song, sounds good and bla but he took something borrowed here 
Sorry like I said, I like eddie as much as the next guy but I won't suck his D in everything he does, the good things I worship them, the bad things I just point it out, like Bruno Mars, he is very good but he basically stole break bot song and he ""make"" treasure.",0.8256,171
