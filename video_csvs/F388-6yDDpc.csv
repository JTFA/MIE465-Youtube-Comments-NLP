ok eagles fans let me put a big what if out there for you all   what if Sunday night dak Prescott throws for four hundred yards five touchdowns and beats your eagles  down meanwhile Wentz throws three ints?  what are you all gonna say then?   nothing at all is what.  if anyone actually watched this game you would know the reffs won this game for Atlanta.   so what's really gonna happen Sunday night?  I'll give you a hint.   the reffs are gonna call another crappy game against Dallas like they have all year and the eagles win big by 25 or 30 points with a little help from their friends in stripes.  the NFL needs to wake up or better yet get rid of Rodger the clown before dallas fans quit watching because cowboy fans are the biggest cash cow for the nfl.  and if that happens NFL will go bankrupt with all the other issues it has.,0.9177,167
