"Although it more than likely has its own spin on a virtual reality crazed dystopian society, it irks me a little to hear Spielberg talk as if this is a new vision of the future by the author. There are a number of authors and books far preceding this one that share this vision. The fact that these books were written years previous suggests to me the real ""visionaries"" were guys like Nealson (Snowcrash 1992) or Tad Williams (Otherland series 1996).  It's probably a good book and very different in its own right, but let's not pretend it's a ""new idea"" just to sell a movie.",0.6852,120

"Let me get this part up front so I'm not downvoted by those who didn't click ""Read More"": Ready Player One was a decent read and, if done properly, could be a good mindless popcorn flick. But lets be realistic here, Stephen Spielberg is WAY overselling it.

@2:48 Spielberg calls Cline a visionary who has seen the future before the rest of us. That made me laugh so hard I almost fell out of my chair.  Every element of Cline's book is derivative. The plot is your standard dystopian, society on the brink of collapse, young adult fare that we've read/seen in The Hunger Games, Divergent, and Maze Runner. The only difference is the virtual reality component but that isn't original or visionary either. The OASIS is a blatant copy of Second Life with VR, down to the whole community content creation and selling of virtual ""property"". Second Life had been out for several years before Cline began writing and VR was entering mainstream development around the same time the book was published. Cline didn't see the future so much as he threw Second Life, emerging VR technology, YA novel dystopian plots, and 80's nostalgia in a blender.",0.806,230

"the book makes no bones about the fact that the main, and mostly the only reason all these ""gunters"" care about all this lore, is because halliday has made it clear that an encyclopedic knowledge of it it going to be required of anyone who wants to have a hope of winning his contest. halliday himself was portrayed as being basically autistic, his abnormal focus on this stuff having given him an incredible command of such trivia, all related to the stuff he grew up with, not to mention having made it completely impossible for him to form normal human relationships.  his business partner was pretty much his only friend, until they fell out, when his friend managed to marry the one woman halliday ever had any social experience with whatsoever, although he never, ever, managed to communicate to her, in any way, the fact that he basically had a huge crush on her.  he was incapable of even trying.  that's how bad off he was.  after that he just became more and more solitary and eccentric, and this is how, near his death, he eventually arrived at this whole willy wonka scenario of his.  wade's response to halliday's announcement was to embark on an ambitious and comprehensive program of study of all the lore halliday ever referenced in his publicly available journals, and it was to wade's great advantage that he managed to become engrossed in the whole thing, personally.  I have no idea how much of this is going to make it into spielberg's movie of course, but I think it's obvious this is a pretty good and original story premise, and I hope spielberg manages to capture the spirit of thing, because I think that would make a really good film",0.9845,323
