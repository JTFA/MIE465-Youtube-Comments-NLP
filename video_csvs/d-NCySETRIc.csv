"Hated this episode, this one doesn't reflect a dilemma about misuse of technology as the other ones... 
It's really infuriating and in the end they don't even give you the satisfaction of seeing how it all gets wrapped up, how she gets what she deserves and that leaves you without that release of the buildup they made. That was pretty bad. 

The way of thinking of that woman was very dumb.. Now, I understand she was nervous and all, but come on.. All of that could have been avoided if she wouldn't have been a pretentious and selfish person.

 Really didn't like this episode's story but hey, the acting is pretty good I will concede that, really made me furious and made me hate Mia.. So that means good acting, and the scenery was great.
