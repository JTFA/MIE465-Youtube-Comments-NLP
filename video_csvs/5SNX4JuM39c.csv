A scholarship and an education is a nice incentive but how many of college players are actually going pro in their respective sport? A very small percentage.

A very very small percentage of players go to the NFL. Other scholarships don‚Äôt require as much time to be given up.

"bbcmotd American/Gridiron Football still has the word ""Football"". Saying that Association Football is ""referred to as football all over the world"" is false. These countries prefer the term ""Soccer"", which is a word that originated in England to differentiate between Rugby Football (which became Ruggers and then eventually just Rugby) and Association Football: USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, and Ireland. It doesn't matter how popular a sport is. A name is a name. Sorry to burst your bubble.",-0.4031,107
"bbcmotd Even if that's a correct number, the number of countries is not equal to population. Staying with the assumption that 4% is the correct number, your next argument is contradicted. If only 4% of the world calls it ""Soccer"" then it isn't the world is it? That would require the full 100%. I honestly can't tell if you're a troll or just ignorant but, either way, pretending that there is ""only one football"" is just false. If the English made the sport what it is today and they started calling it Soccer first, then it is interchangeable. The English also created Rugby and called it Rugby Football. Rugby Football came to the USA and in the 19th Century, they changed the rules up and created Gridiron Football. That makes 3 sports named Football. If you have a problem with it, take it up with the English language.

Edit: According to the most recent censuses, around 18%-21% of the world's population primarily calls Association Football either Soccer or another alternate term in their language. That's about a fifth of the world's population. I just thought that was interesting because I didn't know it was that high.",0.4767,229
