"I beg to differ on the part where drinking will not organize your closet! Back in January my husband and I were doing a lot of decluttering and getting rid of things we didn’t need so that we weren’t surrounded by excess junk (we didn’t have much but it feels so good to purge once in a while). I was going through my desk and file cabinet when my husband gave me a bottle of this beer I had never tried. We were home all day and we thought we’d make it more enjoyable if we drank a bit while decluttering. I was going to tackle my closet after I finished my desk, but I wasn’t looking forward to it because I tend to keep clothes even if I don’t wear them just because they make my closet look pretty. After ten minutes of slowly sipping this beer I’m already feeling buzzed. I ask him what kind of beer it was and it was beer that was brewed or whatever in A whiskey barrel. It was 18% alcohol!! A few more sips and I am tipsy, and before I knew it I finished my desk and file cabinet and was staggering over to the bedroom and starting on my closet. Being tipsy made it SO EASY for me to honestly say “nope, this can go” “seriously, Megan, you are never going to wear this again.” I got rid of over thirty items of clothes and everything left fit on one rack. I also said goodbye to six belts, five pairs of shoes, and a bunch of junk jewelry. My plan (before I started drinking) was to take everything immediately  to Goodwill so I wouldn’t be tempted later to put things back, but because I was so hammered by the time I finished the bottle I had to take a nap instead. The next day I looked at the pile of clothes I was going to give away, and I thought I was going to pick through it and put half of it back in my closet, but when I looked at it I thought “Nope, that’s about right.” So being drunk made me more honest with myself about what I was actually going to wear or what sparked joy and what I could have honestly got rid of. So go ahead, drink that wine and clear out the closet at the same time, and invite me over!",0.994,466
