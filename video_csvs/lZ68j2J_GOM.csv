JESUS LOVES YOU!
He is NOT angry at you, so please stop believing the devil's lies. Jesus died and rose again so that we may live! Find peace and rest for your souls in this Holy Truth. He knows what you are going through. He knows how it feels to be human, so please call upon Him today. He will help you, HE WANTS to help you. You just need to have faith in Him. 

The next hour is not promised to us, and judgement is approaching so quickly (just look around you) so please make Jesus your Lord and Savior, if you haven't already. You WILL be saved! He promises to never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so don't be afraid! 

To die without The Lord is VERY dangerous.
