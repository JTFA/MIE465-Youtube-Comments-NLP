"I had an old Wang ""desktop calculator"" with a 12 digit nixie tube display and keypad connected to the electronics suitcase by a 1/2""' cable. It too was all discrete components, no Integrated Circuits. They used ferrite core memory. I think there were a dozen or so PCB cards which plugged into edge connectors inside the main chassis. It worked for a while, but then something shorted and kept burning out a 5W resistor. I don't have this calculator any more. Piano wire acoustic memory is new to me. Fascinating! When you get everything working on the 2nd unit, tracing out a full schematic from the circuit boards would be a worthy effort.

"It's nice to hear people are excited by the old technology. I worked on the first Anita Mk8 calulators and they used ECC81 valves and trigger tubes. The timing was done with a tube called a Dekatron. The trigger tubes needed a bit of 'cosmic radiation' to actually be able to strike but when the machines casework was on, there was no light entering the works! The trigger tubes has a little device in them called a 'night light' which glowed permanently that took the place of the much needed 'cosmic radiation'  19 meg ohm resistors fed the 'night lights' and often went very high resisstance because they were just carbon. All the fault finding was done using oscilloscopes and Avo8 multimeters  down to component level.. The display was done by Nixie tubes which were stepped by these trigger tubes to the appropriate numbers, The machine had just one single transistor called the Highway transistor and was a silicon 2N3053.
