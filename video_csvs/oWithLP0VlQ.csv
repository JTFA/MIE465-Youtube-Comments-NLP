"The first time I seen this commercial I cried long and head, because Im a dreamer working hard on my dream. knowing in my heart that Im the best at what I do, and I do it better then everyone else I know. This commercial is beautiful One of the best I have ever seen in my life. Who ever came up with the concept  I would love to work with you I am a entertainer hipboydj check my ig out. The commercial is made even better if you know the actor and narrators works in the hit HBO Series ""The Wire"". He played a character who name was Omar Little , Omar was a street guy who robed drug dealers with his  cool swag and while whistling  the song ""The Cheeses Stands Alone"". trench coat and shotgun in hand. this commercial is even more sweet to see the actors contrast in scrip types Omar Little telling his little girl she can be what ever she wants to be as long as she shuts off her ears and know in her self BRILLIANT  best add of 17",0.9918,200

"This ad is something special😍i grew up with my dad always always saying your not gonna achieve this and that, putting me down...it used to throw me of big time as a boy, because the opinion of my dad meant so much. Allot of the time I would prove him wrong, but it did make things seem harder..As time went on  i developed thick skin and the ability to not let negative words have much effect on me. 
Over the years I learnt my dad always wanted the best for me and was saying these things because he wanted me to develop that character. It might not have been the safest or best approach ,but it worked. 
This ad is such a great motivation.Now  whenever i get words that make me feel like i cant do something,from anyone including myself... my brain has an automatic response, it whispers ""there once was some kids that could shut off their ears"" it helps..",0.9861,182
