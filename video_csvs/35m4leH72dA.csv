"Funniest G Like this ad isn't racist and this child isn't African American. In the UK children are often called 'monkeys' as it refers to them being energetic and full of life, running around, jumping and climbing and just being generally cheeky (and if you have ever visited a zoo and seen the monkeys you would understand why). Because of this clothing companies, both big and small use this as a marketing tool and so we can buy tshirts,  vests, jumpers, bags, socks (to name a few) all which say things such as, 'cheeky monkey' 'happiest monkey' 'let go bananas' (again to name a few). Would it be more racist to turn a way a child from modelling a tshirt, which when you aren't looking at this in a racist way, symbolises children being energetic and full of life. 

I understand this word has been used as a derogatory term towards black people, however it is not being used as a derogatory term in this ad, and I this H&M done the right thing in including this kid, as they have chosen to look beyond the colour of his skin, and instead look at him as a child, which is something we all should be doing.",0.977,242

"Sam Green actually, in the UK we often call children 'monkeys' as it refers to them being hyper and energetic, running around and jumping or climbing, and sometimes being a little cheeky. There are lots of clothing companies in the UK, big and small, which therefore use this as a marketing tool, and so we can buy many different items which say things like 'cheeky monkey' 'little monkey' 'lets go bananas' 'monkeying around' (to name a few). Wouldn't it be more racist to turn away a black child from modelling in one of these ranges simply because they are black? Does being black make them any less energetic or active as any other child? Of course not. 

I understand that the word 'monkey' can be used as a derogatory term, and I'm definitely not dismissing the fact that there have been black people called this in a demeaning way, however this is not what this ad intended to do, and it is simply just referring to him as a fun, active and sometimes cheeky little boy.

"The great Prophet Kacou Philippe said: 
37. I asked myself, for what other reason were 68,000,000 Christians indicted and killed in the history of the Church? And I asked myself, will Christians who were put to death for making caricatures of the popes go to hell? Will John Calvin go to hell for the Treatise on Relics? If they go to hell, we shall go to hell. But if they go to Paradise, I and mine shall go to Paradise. And our faith rests upon it.

38. Attacking the devil whatever the manner, it cannot be against the will of God. It can never be against the will of God. Attacking a woman in menses who stands at the pulpit, attacking a woman in menses who stands at the altar; it can never be against the will of God and it can never be it.

39. Your Honor, everything I preached since July 8, 2002 and which is contained in my book, it is in the virtue of the divine mission that I received on April 24th, 1993 that I preached it. And till my death, I will never accept that some losers will transform the Bible into a trade item and poor souls into clients. It is my mission and I have never obliged anyone to accept it.

40. A Christian or a Muslim cannot condemn me because I say that I am the only true prophet of God on the earth today because it is the way and the language of all prophets of God.

41. There is not a single prophet who did not say that he was the only prophet of God in his generation. And unlike Mahomet, I did never take a sword to wage a holy war. South Africa never imprisoned Ahmed Deedat.

42. And for me, all these sufferings since my abduction, my persecution and my detention by the police of the general intelligence services where I remained seated for five days and five nights sitting on a chair, the traumatization by the scientific police division, the nights in the basement of the police headquarters, the cells of the prosecutor's office and now the biggest prison of Abidjan, it is the history of the prophets repeating itself.

43. I have already forgiven you. In my prison cell, I asked myself a thousand questions. Has God become Satan and now it is Abel in prosecutor's clothing who persecutes Cain? And is it the disciples of Lord Jesus who deliver the Pharisees and false prophets to courts and to Roman soldiers contrarily to the recommendations of the Lord Jesus. I did not understand.

44. And if my book incited religious hatred, why did a French publisher publish it and the ‚ÄúLibrairie de France‚Äù sold it in Ivory Coast?

45. Everything I suffered, I will take it before Him that sent me on April 24, 1993. But as for me, I will not harm anyone.

46. When I was a little boy, playing in the dust, I said to my parents that, till my death, I would never harm anyone, I would never fight with anyone and I would never take anyone to police and it is not now that I am a Christian that I will do it. I shall never hurt someone! I can even not do it! You see?

47. And I asked that copies of this letter be given to the press and every institution of law. And that was done and this text was published in its integrality on the internet and even in international newspapers.

48. Those are the words that I wrote for my defense from my cell of the MACA, the biggest prison of Abidjan on May 29, 2016.",-0.9896,701

I understand that in the past the word monkey has been used as a derogatory term however in this case it has not, I think H&M have done the right thing in including this kid in their clothing campaign as they have chosen to look beyond the colour of his skin and simply look at him as a child. Which is what we all should be doing.",0.3557,252

"janmarsh regardless of who ur target market is its still a business suicide to use racial slurs in  selling,marketing or trading ur product, u simply are running a major risk of  overall profits decline if ur consumer Base boycott ur product especially in the clothing industry,and then the perception of the new market u target already have a tainted image of ur product and that's why people simply say the world is a global market bye felicia",-0.7184,82

"well I mean the fact that we were all monkeys before is a scientifical view and i doubt theweeknd and other celebs like g eazy and lebron were offended due to the fact that it mimics the fact that everyone was once a primate. I'm just saying as sensitive as some african americans are to this type of topic, they do have good reason as to why they can be offended. Its honestly up towards the person as to how you'd want to take this.",0.6486,89
