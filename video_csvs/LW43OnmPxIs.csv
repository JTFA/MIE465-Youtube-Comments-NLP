"American here. It‚Äôs weird to see John in his ‚Äúnative environment.‚Äù Discovering that he knows people over there ‚Äî has friends even ‚Äî and gets choked up over (I‚Äôm guessing) a soccer uniform? is like finding out he didn‚Äôt just make up that accent to entertain us.

My whole worldview is blown. Oliver might think he sounds like he ‚Äúdoes not belong here.‚Äù He‚Äôs wrong. Once he replaced his British teeth for American ones, we forgot he had an accent. 

In any case, you can‚Äôt have him back, you silly kni-guts. He‚Äôs ours. Hands off!

Also, who is that guy he‚Äôs talking to? Is he a thing? Never heard of him (and he‚Äôs harder to understand.) Also, ‚ÄúStandard Chartered‚Äù is a weird name for a soccer (or cricket) team.",0.4082,177

I can also say there's a lot of people that are just checked out now, they just avoid all news like the plague. And voting is tough to sell to the younger generation and the older generation seems to just vote republican no matter who it is. They just vote republican. I know a lot of people who voted for trump yet hated him but he was republican so they felt they ""had to"" meanwhile younger generations hated him and just said ""Impossible, he will never win"" and of anyone I know from my age and lower (I'm 36) I was the only one who voted. :( Same with this net neutrality, I don't consider myself very politically active, but it's not hard to write a letter or call your local senate about an issue and I made my voice known about the net neutrality and even posted on facebook how important it is for people to speak their mind, giving them an easy link to click on.

"I fail to see how Oliver ""took down"" Hoffman. The reaction of the audience means NOTHING cuz audiences are a bunch of dumb-fucks who know the least about ANYTHING; if they were in a Trump audience, it would had been Oliver who would had been booed. Seriously, fuck audiences, they need to shut the fuck up because they are the most biased ignoramuses in the room so stop interrupting the discussion.

I am not taking a side between Oliver or Hoffman's discussion (though Oliver definitely did not ""take him down"" base on their discussion alone), because I don't know. But that is EXACTLY why I hate the liberal position of this. Instead of going ""we don't have evidence so let's investigate and go through due process,"" it's ""we don't have evidence so he's 100% guilty.""

"Thing is that most of these sexual harassment issues brought up are bs, as the socalled ""victim"" going along with it is the problem, not the one acting within the boundaries offered to him... most of them werent even made aware of the boundaries, many of them didnt even existed at that time. In most of these recent ""famous people"" cases the fear for not getting/losing money, a job or fame when saying no /leaving is not an excuse, only a threat to health and safety is an acceptable defence for going along with sexual harassment in a western culture ... but even that loses it means as an excuse for most cases when the ""victim"" stays silent afterwards, when the threat is gone you either speak up or you make made your vote for the issue not being an issue.

Claiming the majority of these people who years later suddenly remember that they are victims, would mean that these people were not capable of making their own decisions and didnt grew up to become legally and socially competent, hence that they were/are in need of a legal guardian ... good luck with that route.

And in the end of the day: you got touched against your will or had to hear a sexist phrase ... yeah, what a cruel experience and the longlasting pain of it, horrible ... fuck this issue, we have actual problems in the world and these media hypes around matters of temporary inconvenience are distracting massivly and seriously preventing us from ever getting important shit done ... even if you have a point, stop fuckin cut in line with your egos and give that spotlight people who need it for crucial matters of health and safety.",-0.9892,320
