"Has anybody else had bad dreams like mine? Hear me out now.

(3 of my friends have had dreams about this thing all in this one house)

So we were driving in my truck when the battery died and the truck just stopped. Everything in my bed of the pickup was thrown all over the road. We went to go pick things up that had been thrown out when a police officer came by and said ""do you need help with that?"" He took two people from my truck and drove them around while I was picking things up. Every time I got closer to my truck it would feel like I was getting further away. I would look around and I'd se a figure in a dark cloak with no face (I thought id see a deer head) I reached my truck after I felt like an hour of walking and when I opened the door to get in I just appeared in a trashed room. The figure was outside a window opening a back door behind me, but now yelling for a hat. He kept saying ""give me the hat! Give me the hat!"" He chased and tried to claw and grab me through that room until I got out of the doorway on the otherside. When I stepped out I was in the back of the car with my friends in the dream but the cop had no eyes and my friends had said ""come for a ride and see the hat"" 


Then I woke up and this dream has haunted me for a year. I hate nightmares.",0.6902,296

Do I turn myself into the police?‚Äô It was a horrifying experience. But, the dream concludes after I had said to myself _‚ÄôI‚Äôm a homicidal maniac!‚Äô_

"If we're sharing dreams in the comments, here's a weird one I had when I was rather young (maybe 6 or 7) that I've never forgotten: When the dream starts, I find myself in a supermarket, stocking shelves ~~probably prophetic of my late teens working in a supermarket~~ , though instead of regular retail attire I was wearing a white lab coat. Next of note is that this dream was absolutely silent. So, I'm working away, when I just happen to turn my head to the left, and I see a bunch of people crowded around something. Intrigued, I leave my work and head over to see what it is. Edging my way into the crowd, I see a fish tank seated upon a table, and inside some leafy fronds swaying in the water, as well as one of those comedy masks (of the theatre comedy/tragedy masks). The mask was _alive_ , and it was talking. Its mouth was moving, but of course, as I mentioned, the dream was silent, so I had no idea what was being said.

All of a sudden, the crowd around me is startled, is scared, and they all take off running. Not knowing why (I figure something the mask said did it, but as to what that was, I have no clue), I decide 'welp, I better run as well'. So I start running, making my way to the exit, when I hit an invisible wall. I can see the store's exit, but I'm just running in place. Then I stop running, realizing I'm not going anywhere. The dream concludes with me panning down to look at my torso...and at that moment, a pair of furry hands grabs my sides (WTF). And then I woke up.

I have no idea WTF any of that was. Also, I FELT THE HANDS AS THEY GRABBED ME. I was so freaked out then, and still freaked out now just remembering it. I wonder if I was maybe sick that night and had maybe taken some medicine, or perhaps it was just a child's overactive brain playing with too many ideas at once. Whatever it was...guh.",-0.971,427

My WiFi went out for a year...







Ok for the real story now,
I was laying on my bed paralyzed when I saw this spider like humanoid on my wall. it had thin strands of hair, about 4 or 6 strands. It‚Äôs body was facing the wall corner but it‚Äôs arms, legs and head were facing me, the legs were bent the opposite way they normally would bend. I lay there paralyzed until I shot up and ran to my parents room, ( this all seemed so real, in color, every detail perfected) and the humanoid ran towards me like a spider, it was like I was in a horror movie. I yelled, ‚ÄúMoMY! TheRe IS A gHoSt After me!‚Äù To my mom. The humanoid was crawling slowly to me, now like a normal human would, and my mom said there was nothing there while I was crying my eyeballs out and dragging against their bed. It got closer... and closer.... it jumped on me and that is where it all ended. I shot up and told my sister about it. She thought it was very terrifying.

The black coat and the white hair and the kidnapping is probably a movie she saw a story she read, it doesn't have to be in this particular  time it could be from childhood or any time in her life.

"Probably the weirdest dreams I've ever had are extremely tough to narrow down to one or two weirdest dreams. First one was that I was in this weird avatar movie forest that was glowing and I had two of my friends just messing around and one of their dads. I just hung back with the dad and he for some reason went down to this stream and picked up a fish, he proceeded to say, ""it looks just like you."" I said, ""yeah, it does."" I don't remember much after that but it was just me hanging out in the forest.
Second dream I had was when I started in my parents bathroom, there was a swarm of people (and I mean an actual swarm. Packed in like sardines) in my parents bedroom. I was sitting on this mini volcano and there was a talking frog. I started talking with it and he at one point asked me if he could sit on the mini volcano but I said he would die from the lava. I then talked to him more until he asked me if I wanted to go on an adventure with home. I said yes and my dream ended just before the actual interesting part began.",0.9289,231

I started laughing, which made me not so scared (maybe that wasn't his intention). That night, I had the weirdest nightmare. I was walking through a forest on a sunny day, everything looked beautiful, suddenly 3 mutated dogs jump in front of me and surround me. I'm so scared, but I call the mammoth. He comes here and is like: ""What's up dude?"" and I point at the dogs. He takes out his phone and starts calling someone, I can only hear: ""Hey ma'am, do something with your children!"". Then a chubby white bunny hops in and angrily takes the dogs home. The dream ends when I say thank you to the mammoth. I wake up thinking: ""What the fuck just happened?""",-0.3077,263

"my only dream which i remember is really fuckin  weird.
so as far as I know it starts out with me being a fallout character, im sneaking around a super mutant gladiator pit, im also shooting at the ones in the pit, with a laser riffle, but they're the only ones who notice it. none of the spectators notice, by the way the spectators are mostly raiders and super mutants which i remember for  some reason. at somepoint i'm thrown into the pit after I bump into one of the super mutants  in the crowd, I try running away  and get to  the entrance of the pit where I hide and the bulking super mutant in the pit can't  get to. I then somehow  climb out at a completely different part breaking continuity, and  then for some reason it's london, with a gladiator pit, in the desert, except also in a forested city, and it keeps phasing between that and the fallout thing. then i'm an agent trying to stop a terrorist attack on Big Ben. I fail and the entire top of big ben explodes.
I wake up in the forest, and i'm either being poked or see some kids my age, and now apparently i'm real life me and not a fallout character who is also apart of the cia. there's also 2 kinda famous kids there who if I say the names of will  just be the most confusing and oddest part of this story. it continues on with some characters just disappearing from the story and reappearing at random times, where we're trying to get to another city where we'll be safe. also the whole time we're in a kinda mystical  and enchanting forest, nothing else really happens",0.3551,317
