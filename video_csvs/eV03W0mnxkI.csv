"+Jon Fye SpaceX didn't lose that satellite. There's no indication the vehicle performed any less than flawlessly. Even some of their customers (SES, Iridium) reviewed the launch telemetry and confirmed nothing went wrong. SpaceX isn't the kind to make coverups.
Also, landing the rocket adds about 15% extra fuel in reality, not >50% as ULA's ""SMART"" reuse video claimed (without evidence).",0.092,79

"@Ben Bublil "" I said it‚Äôs out of date"" - Atlas 5's  second stage  Centaur  is  more  advanced than SpaceX's  second  stage. Merlin-1D uses RP1/LO2 open cycle , while  RL10 uses LH2/LO2 closed  cycle, consequently RL10 has higher specific impulse and Centaur much more capable than Falcon 9's second stage. But of course Falcon 9's first stage is awesome, hope  we  will see its incarnation with Raptor engines.",0.9039,88
"All ULA cares about is stealing tax payer dollars out of the treasury. They prevented innovation over the last 2 decades. ULA and parent companies and any subsidiaries should be barred from competing in the industry for the next 20 years.

We have been robbed by this company and they do not deserve our support.

"Congratulations on your continuing success. i can only wish you well. That is the reason behind what i write next.

For some criticism on your presentation...

No enthusiasm. When i watch a Space x launch the controllers are very excited expressing their enthusiasm. 

Do not give me nonsense that it does not appear professional. Screw appearances. Even when I am watching your launches I am fist pumping and delighted when events happen correctly as I enjoy your success.

(Of course I yell at TeeVee sets during football games.)

I find that space launches and space exploration to be exciting and awe inspiring. That is why I tune in. I live my life with gusto, enthusiastically. Don't you?

Enthusiasm is infectious and only attracts others to desire to contribute to the spectacle. You will garner much more public support when you express it.

During Coast Phases play appropriate MUSIC. Even during Football games music is played during drives and during halftime.

When you can make spaceflight ENTERTAINING then the crowds will demand even more.

The Moon Race and Landings were entertaining and that held the Public's interest. Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 held the audience on the edge of their seats.

When that excitement was lost and it was advertised as business as usual then Public support waned and so did subsequent funding.

The failure of NASA was a Public Relations failure. They lost public support. 

That is why your competitor, Space X, is going to take us to Mars. .before NASA. Elon Musk is SELLING IT....Marketing it.

Compete damn it. Be enthusiastic in that which you do. Sell your vision of the future.",0.9954,310

"If cost were comparable SpaceX would have never gotten their foot in the door, especially given how much obstruction they have faced in the past 10 years. It's not even close. Falcon 9 is $65 million per rocket, Atlas 5 is $110 million per rocket. Falcon 9's are reusable while Atlas 5's are not.  Reusability is the future, It doesn't matter who's rocket it is. We can't keep using 1960's tech and methodology if we are going to lower launch cost and allow for larger launch vehicles that are sorely needed. Launch cost are the reason why rocket size has been stagnant for decades. A single none reusable Delta 4 Heavy launch cost $425 million+,  and the Delta 4 Heavy can only carry 22 tons to LEO. That's only 1/5th of what the Saturn 5 could put into LEO. Cost have got to come down, and Reusability is the key.",-0.0961,176

"Thrust honestly doesn't matter in vacuum, you're still going to get to your planned orbit... it's just going to take longer. With the RL-10 having an ISP (specific impulse) of 450s which is very efficient for an engine. This really comes into play for direct GEO injections or beyond Earth orbit missions. The centaur stage and DCSS (Delta IV upper stage) is also capable of long coasts which would be hard (but possible with FH) for the F9 2nd stage because of the propellants. If F9 had a centaur upper stage, it would be the most capable rocket ever.",0.9097,115

"Zuma wasn't lost by SpaceX, It was a 100% clean and successful launch on their end. If anything happened, it was after the hand-off which means something went wrong with the satellite itself. ""If"" being the key word there since the DoD won't confirm on deny if Zuma was lost at all and everything else is just rumor at this point. The Atlas series of rockets is over 60 years old and it had it's teething problems just like all new technology does with over 120 failed launches and losses throughout the series. SpaceX will have it's teething problems to, but SpaceX rockets reusability is the only thing that is going to bring down launch cost by 50% or more.
