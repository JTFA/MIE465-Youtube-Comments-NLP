"Conan made this comment, at 1:14:

""in 1915, the U.S. invaded to impose stability, while also removing the gold from the Haitian national bank.""

This is true. What Conan didn't mention is that some of this gold was owned by American citizens:

In 1915, 'United States citizens owned perhaps 40 percent of the stock in the National Bank of Haiti'.

Source: http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Wilsonian-Missionary-Diplomacy-Intervention-in-haiti.html

Some of the other gold was seized to pay off debts that the Haitian government owed to U.S. banks:

'In 1915 the United States, responding to complaints to President Woodrow Wilson from American banks to which Haiti was deeply in debt, occupied the country.'

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Haiti#United_States_occupation_(1915‚Äì34)

'Six months before the invasion, Marines had disembarked in Haiti and removed the equivalent in today‚Äôs terms of $11 million in gold from the National Bank of Haiti and transferred it to the National City Bank of New York, on the grounds that the funds might be needed to pay back U.S. bankers.'

Source: https://www.socialstudies.org/sites/default/files/USInvadesHaiti.pdf

Conan never mentioned all the free money the U.S. government has given to the Haitian government:

'The U.S. has been Haiti's largest donor since 1973. Between FY 1995 and FY 2003, the U.S. contributed more than $850 million in assistance to Haiti. 

...

The President's budget request for FY 2007 was $198 million.

...

The largest earthquake ever recorded in Haiti's history occurred on January 12, 2010 and registered 7.0 on the Richter scale. 

...

On January 14 the Obama administration announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti to meet its immediate needs, in addition to pre-existing funding appropriated for Haiti.'

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti%E2%80%93United_States_relations#U.S._economic_and_development_assistance_to_Haiti

'Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling nearly 20% of GDP. ... primarily from the U.S.'

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Haiti

'2 million people of Haitian descent live in the United States

...

Haitians who receive visas to immigrate into the U.S. (averaging over 13,000 annually in fiscal year 1999‚Äì2003)'

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti%E2%80%93United_States_relations

20% of Haiti's income comes from remittances. And most are from the U.S.

Who let all these Haitians legally immigrate to the U.S.? The American government. 

Why does Conan never mention any of these facts? Because he wants to paint a biased view that the U.S. government has been stealing from Haiti. The U.S. government is the bad guy. Conan is cherry-picking facts to suit his agenda. Trump does the exact same thing. Conan constantly bashes Trump and yet, here is Conan doing the exact same thing‚Äîfake news, a fake history lesson.

"FLASHBACK: Conan O‚ÄôBrien Trashes Haiti With ‚ÄúBurning Pile of Tires‚Äù Joke In 2005 (VIDEO)
by Joshua Caplan     12 February 2018
http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/02/flashback-conan-obrien-trashes-haiti-burning-pile-tires-joke-2005-video/

Late-night talk show host Conan O‚ÄôBrien rushed to Haiti‚Äôs defense after President Trump allegedly branded the country a, ‚Äúshithole,‚Äù amid recent immigration reform negations. In January 2018, the comedian even visited Haiti in an attempt to show how ‚Äúbeautiful,‚Äù a country it is.  

    #Haiti is truly a beautiful country. #ConanHaiti pic.twitter.com/CfxDFvNz2i

    ‚Äî Conan O'Brien (@ConanOBrien) January 21, 2018

As Infowars Editor-at-Large Paul Joseph Watson pointed out, O‚ÄôBrien snapped the shot of him sipping a cocktail from a coconut at the Wahoo Bay Beach Resort, ‚Äúa luxury bubble at which rooms cost $254 dollars a night, a whopping sum when you consider that most Haitians make little over $400 a year.‚Äù

In a video posted to YouTube Saturday 10 February 2018, O‚ÄôBrien is seen making a joke about Haiti‚Äôs garbage problem in 2005.

‚ÄúHaiti, You just celebrated two hundred years of independence. Congratulations. Now make a wish and blow out your burning pile of tires,‚Äù joked O‚ÄôBrien.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaJtXA1FhEY

The joke that would surely be insensitive by today‚Äôs standards, was part of the comedian‚Äôs sketch called ‚ÄòConan O‚ÄôBrien Hates My Homeland.‚Äô The premise of the sketch, which ran from 2004 and 2007, was to insult every country to ‚Äúin order to figure out,‚Äù which countries the Conan O‚ÄôBrien Show aired in.",0.9712,302

1.Why don't you reflect that there is 75% of poverty in rural areas and 40% in urban areas?
2. 50% of unemployment in urban areas
3. people there earn 2‚Ç¨ each day, while 24.7% of the population lives on less than $1.25 per day.
4. There are more than  380,000 orphans in Haiti¬†since 2010 and those numbers are growing every single day.
5.100,000 children who are aged 5 years or younger suffer from acute malnutrition. The mortality rate for this age group is 88 per 1000 live births.
One in three children suffers from stunted growth or is irreversibly short for their age.One-third of women and children in Haiti are anemic.
Numbers from UNICEF in 2015 peg the infant mortality rate at 55 per 1000 births.
Approximately 1 in 285 births in Haiti will result in a woman‚Äôs death. This is 16 times higher compared to the United States.The life expectancy is 63 years.

Random Comment You continue to ignore my point. I didn't say reason behind slavery I mentioned the Europeans. A vital point. Also did I say you nee to learn about Haiti specifically. No. I mentioned that if you knew more about the Slave and Atlantic Economy you would know how Haiti fits. And you question about their 'riches' would be answered. Read more carefully. Your just proving how ignorant you are. And it's pathetic how you just assume where I'm from? What country are you from? America?,-0.9161,101

"So why does my liberal social work professor go to Haiti to help out and bring back pictures of haiti of destitute and famished areas and say that is how the majority of haiti is and this man manages to never show anyone the conditions of the beaches and villages the Haitian people live in. He never shows anyone the conditions of anything, I never once saw someone in her pictures that had the nice clothing all these people had. No I'm not saying Trump's description is good but there is truth behind that this country is a third world country and the vast majority is extremely poor.",0.1181,112

"Trump calls them a shithole country and is called every named in the book , the Clintons and their foundation literally robbed the Haitian people of billions, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths due to the theft of humanitarian aide given to the Clinton Foundation that was to be used for the Haitian people after the earthquake but instead the Clintons pocketed the money that was to be used for homes,  healthcare, clean water etc.. ( only a few homes were built & a ridiculous soccer stadium, no sewer system or clean water system were built which led to the death of many )  HRC's brother somehow got a gold mining claim/ permit ( Not sure offhand of proper terminology right now ) even though no one has been able to get a claim for years in the gold rich country, so they're still robbing them. During the Presidential campaigns , Many Haitians protested HRC's speeches and appearances but MSM chose to not air any of them !!! Do the research , the Haitian people will tell you...",0.2206,190

"You daft? the reason behind the slave trade is common sense, you don't need history class to figure that out. And fyi, I didn't need to learn about slave history within the insignificant dot of a country, because my country wasn't formed on the basis of slavery, unlike yours. Haiti and everything that deals with Haiti is just depressing in general- as there is no moral to it. Haiti started off as a slave colony and still continues to be a terribly poverty stricken country, with no signs of any sort of economic or cultural emergence. If this were a segment on a former slave colony that broke the shackles and became a developed- hell even developing country, it'll be a worthwhile topic, because there is actual substance to that. This story was obviously hastily made based on the comments made by a lunatic president- and it shows.",-0.9846,165
