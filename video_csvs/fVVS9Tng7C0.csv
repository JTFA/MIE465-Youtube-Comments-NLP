"As a Black person, I’m irritated with the fact that the majority of Black people, don’t like it when white folks disrespect them and they’re like “We need to stick together as Black people”, when some of them ALSO disrespect other black people of religion, ethic background, mannerisms, social status and their favorite, sexual orientation. So while y’all talking about “We need to stick together as Black people”, we as Blacks need to include and stick with those who are Black and a Muslim, who are Black and rich social class, who are Black and gay, Black and Latino, the list goes on. However unfortunately, not every Black life matters. It appears only Black heterosexuals who are Christians lives matter.",0.2023,149
