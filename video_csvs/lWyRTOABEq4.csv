"3:20 i think that tournament worked for fans of the series as the climax. Since up to that point the whole show  had been building to the kids wizard trial.  
It's sort of a coming of age ceremony for wizards.
Where only one child per family could be the adult  wizard when they enter adulthood.

For the rest of the series after this movie Alex (Selena Gomez) was the only wizard in her immediate family and her training and responsibility as the family wizard was more serious.",-0.1513,94
