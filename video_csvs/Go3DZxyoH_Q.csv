radioactivsmurf How long have you been watching her? She's told many times in the show that she likes an Indian restaurant that's 45mins from her home. She's also made a butter masala and Channa masala video.,0.4215,39
radioactivsmurf lol she's had recipes for Mexican food and baba ghanoush is Persian. She doesn't only do Italian food,0.4215,20
