After watching the video of 2017 and the horrifying things that have existed and proceeded to exist in this world I have to say I still believe in myself and I do search over 50 years into myself as a person that is why I still have to leave on my personal basis I still believe that I must keep believing that each day can get better I know that the world is in a terrible situation at times for over half-a-century I have been here and maybe a half a century more for we conquer what is and what should be with our heart not with weapons and not with imaginary situations of things that don't even exist a jet I talking for myself I still believe I leave most of all my questions to God but I search myself and I start what the man in the mirror which is myself I do not judge anyone poor judgement sometimes is wrong to me to forgive is divine and to forgive and forget is divine and is to be treasured within our hearts and in our souls for we each have a heart and soul so if we each would follow the goodness of our Heart and souls perhaps a lot of things would not be happening in 2017 such as corruption such as the world trying to the world trying to fight over Land Oil and the rights of the world that was not made by man we exist for a short time in this world we should all enjoy this world as much as possible and being disabled I no in my own heart I am speaking for myself as I watch video after video that I'm commenting on that it has been a terrible situation and some things I recap that haven't gone normal in my life I have been alone for over 21 years but that perhaps is my choice. I do believe that miracles happen everyday I do believe that we are that miracle I believe for my own personal View we as a nation ourselves we as a person ourselves myself I am my worst fear and fear is fear itself. It does not exist. I am not a bible thumper but yet over the 50 years over half a century that I have been here I have learned many things that our soul or mind are hard it creates Who We Are what we project and become is inside of us none of us can change the world we can only change the person in the mirror thank you once again and I hope and yes I do pray for everyone to have a great 2018 and thank you for any comments weather good or bad it only makes a person stronger perhaps in even what I may say next time sometimes we say stuff from our hearts and sometimes we say things out of anger but always before I go to bed I make sure that I forgive even myself for forgiveness is a virtue and to forgive and forget is divine thank you...,0.9912,527
