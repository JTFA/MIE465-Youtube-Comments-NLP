"Dear friends Jesus Christ loves you so much. Please put Him above all things because He IS above all things. This includes your problems, your pain, and the swirling events of this everchanging world. When you behold the Presence of Jesus Christ, you rise above circumstances and rest with Him in heavenly realms. This is the way to Peace, living in the light of our Lord. I guarantee you will always have problems in this life but they must not become your focus. When you feel yourself sinking in the sea of circumstances, say ""Help me, Jesus!"" and He WILL draw you back to Him. If you have to say it thousands of times daily, don't be discouraged. Jesus knows your weakness and He WILL meet you right there in that very place. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Romans 8:39; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.8562,197

"Frank Champion Man city and Liverpool, that‚Äôs 2 already in, but Man Utd have to go against Sevilla who are in form and Tottenham still have one more game against Juve and with Dybala coming back it would be difficult to defend, I‚Äôm not saying that the Serie A has better quality I‚Äôm just saying the title race makes it the most intense out of the top 5 leagues which makes it more entertaining to watch unlike the premier league which is pretty much already over and if Chelsea can‚Äôt beat Watford and Bournemouth then how will they par with an undefeated Barca side?",0.9406,116
Frank Champion it‚Äôs been the worst league since city confirmed themselves as champions currently the best league is Serie A because of the intense title race,0.8271,28
Frank Champion your comment is irrelevant to mine we‚Äôre talking about the Serie A not the champions league and there will likely be only 2-3 English teams going through since Chelsea are likely to lose against Barca,-0.1471,39

TopazMouse um we had a 21 year defending Higuain....... Toby Alderweireld didn‚Äôt play and the first leg was absolute bs. First goal was offside and the second goal was Aurier fault. I doubt Poch will let him play in the second leg. Juventus got lucky. Tottenham dominated the game. And I don‚Äôt see how Juventus will win at Wembley.,0.7351,70
