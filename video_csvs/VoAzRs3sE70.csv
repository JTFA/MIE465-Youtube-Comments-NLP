"The book “A Monster Calls,” is a novel based on a boy named Conor O’Malley. He is introduced at the start of the book and he was told as a boy who had nightmares in his sleep at The book “A Monster Calls,” is a novel based on a boy named Conor O’Malley. He is introduced at the start of the book and he was told as a boy who had nightmares in his sleep at night. He hasn’t told anyone about his nightmares except his dad, and according to Connor, a monster comes daily at night at 12:07. The monster is a gigantic yew tree that lives in the creepy cemetery behind Conor’s home. Conor is not afraid of the monster and he questions if the monster is even real. The monster claims that he has “come walking” again to help. Conor thought that the monster came to save his mother from cancer, and the thought remained with him until the end of the book. When the monster first talked to him he told Conor that he was going to tell him three stories and Conor was going to tell him the fourth. Throughout the monster’s visits, Conor would always end up safe and tucked in his bed so he would always think it was a dream. However, there are always marking signs that the “monster” leaves in his bedroom, such as small branches being scattered all over the floor, small red yew berries all over the floor, and a small sapling planted in the middle of his hardwood floor. He would always say nothing about those little signs and would clean them up before his mother woke up. 

From the start of the book we learned that his mother had cancer, but throughout the chapters, we realized that her sickness was only getting worse and none of the medications were working. The next day his mother gave him a very good day where they went outside and ate a lot of comfort food so that she could tell him and give him “the talk.” So the next day Conor realized that his grandmother was moving in so she could help his mother with her daily routine because her sickness was slowing her down. Conor and his grandmother didn’t really have a strong relationship so she usually just rushed him to school early in the morning. The school was another problem for Conor because he usually got bullied by Harry and his little group of friends. Lily was the only person to stand up for him against Harry, even though he threw her under the bus when he sold her out to the teacher. They stopped being friends for a good chunk of the book until Lily wrote him notes as an apology later on in the book. His teacher also knew that he had a problem with Harry and the other boys but he refused to tell her anything. Over the past few weeks, his mother went to the hospital for further medication so he had to move in with his grandmother and get rushed to the school in the morning so his grandmother could rush to see his mother. 

During those early school nights, the monster would come at 12:07 to tell him these stories, although Conor didn’t enjoy or like them, he was forced to listen to them. The first tale was a prince and a king who re-married an evil queen but then the king got ill and died so the queen ruled the kingdom. The prince then fell in love with a farmer's daughter and they ran far away from the kingdom to escape his step-mother. The following night the monster told that the farmer’s daughter was found dead and the prince framed the queen of killing the daughter. So he went back to the kingdom and used the anger of the villagers to overthrow the queen from the throne. Then the monster came in and saved the queen from the villagers and the prince ruled the kingdom, being a very well-loved king. The purpose of this tale was to tell Conor that things are not always the way they appear. This story confused Conor and he didn’t really understand the true meaning of this story. Later in the story, Conor’s dad came to give him a visit which made him very happy to see his father again after he moved to America with his new family. His father also gave him the best day like his mother where they went to the amusement park, ate lots of food, and had a great time. That all led to “a talk” where his father had to personally tell Conor that his mother wasn’t getting better even though he refused to accept that the medicine wasn’t working. This was because his mother had a mindset on Conor that she was going to get better and that she was going to come home perfectly fine. This is what the “monster” wanted Conor to acknowledge, that his mother was near her end and that she couldn’t be saved. Despite Conor being confused about the message at his grandmother’s house and school, the monster returned to tell Conor the second tale. The second tale was about the Apothecary, which was the old way of saying doctor or chemist, who was a bitter man and charged a lot for his cures. Then in the in the Apothecary’s village lived a parson who had two daughters that would run around a yew tree all afternoon. The apothecary asked for the yew tree because of its barks healing powers but the parson refused. Then the parson’s two daughters became extremely ill and the parson begged the Apothecary to save his daughters and he was willing to give up everything for them. The Apothecary turned down his offer and the next morning both of the parson’s daughters passed away. Then the monster came walking again to smash the parson’s house, Conor was confused at first but the monster convinced him that breaking things is satisfying. So then Conor had that sudden urge to break everything. That’s when he erupted his emotions onto his grandmother’s highly valued clock and her entire living room. He broke everything except for the glass cabinet which his grandmother destroyed herself when she saw all the debris he created. His father came to visit in the morning and that he was surprised by the amount of damage he had done. Conor asked if he was going to be punished but then his father replied by “what purpose could it possibly serve.” 

Through near the last couple chapters of the book, Lily wrote Conor a note saying that she was sorry and asked if he was ok, she also said that she saw him. Through the story, Conor was invisible to the school except for Harry who bullied him. However, even Harry left him alone when he said: “you are invisible to me”. This angered Conor very much which summoned the “monster” which no one saw. That was when the monster came to tell Conor the third story. The story was about an invisible man who no one saw, then Conor asked if the man was ever seen again. The monster said yes and that he made the people see him, this was when Conor and the “monster” charged Harry in front of his school. Conor beat Harry up and knocked out some of his teeth, Harry was going to need medical attention and Conor was rushed to the principal's office. The amount of damage he did could get him expelled, according to the principal. Then they decided to drop the whole punishment because the principle said: “What purpose could it possibly serve?” This probably was led up to because they realized how much he was struggling with family. 

At the near of the ending of the story, Conor’s mom was getting even worse than she was before and she barely has enough energy to stay awake after her medications. This was when he saw his grandmother and his dad have an argument on what should happen. He let the argument slide but then he realized that his mother was going to die soon. This happened during the fourth tale, the tale he was supposed to tell the monster. He met the monster in the graveyard and told him to wake up and asked him why his mother wasn’t healed. The monster replied by saying “She would’ve been healed if the yew tree could heal her.” Then the nightmare came, his mother was sitting perfectly still and fine until she started to fall in the nightmare. Conor grabbed onto his mother and the monster was emotionless but he wanted the truth from Conor. Conor refused to tell the monster the truth and he continued to hold onto his mother. Conor was confused on what to do but the monster kept nagging him to speak the truth. After a couple Conor said he was afraid to speak the truth but the monster said that he was afraid but he will still do it. It was twenty one minutes away from 12:07 and Conor just wanted to hold on until then to see what will happen but tears were spilling out of his eyes like rivers. After the monster told him again Conor took a deep breath and told the truth, and at last he finally spoke the final truth and told his mother that he didn’t want her to go. Then he finally let go.",-0.4433,1779
