"I know EXACTLY how this movie is gonna go!

They hear about this new agency hiring or using supers for whatever reason. Bob thinks they want him but they actually want Helen and ohhhhhh Bob is sexist for assuming they want him and blah blah blah. She goes to work for them and Bob is stuck at home taking care of the kids.

He's doing work at home and oh hahaha being a mom is the hardest job in the universe and men suck blah blah blah. Bob will find something out or see some indication that this agency that hired Helen is evil and he'll tell Helen she should quite working for them. She'll OBVIOUSLY hit him with the usual stuff, oh you think I can't do this cause I'm a woman? Are you jealous that they hired me instead of you? That kind of stuff basically. 

Bob will turn out to be right eventually. The agency will be evil or bad in some way so she'll quite and they'll group up to defeat the main bad guy or whatever. In between all these plot points you'll have badly written and cringy dialogue from pretty much all the characters. Jokes won't be nearly as funny or clever as before and Bob will be generally bashed throughout the movie. The general messages will be the following. 

(1) Women can do anything men can do.
(2) Men suck.
(3) Being a mom is WAY harder than anything men/Bob has done or will ever do.
(4) Helen is right in every single way no matter what.

Pixar movies have gotten worse and worse in my opinion. They're all decent movies for the most part but we haven't had a great one in awhile. PC culture is destroying these movies. The writing is also getting worse. As I said before, the jokes and writing in general isn't going to be nearly as clever or funny. Expect a lot of cringe. I hope to God I'm wrong. I really want this movie to be good.",-0.989,379
