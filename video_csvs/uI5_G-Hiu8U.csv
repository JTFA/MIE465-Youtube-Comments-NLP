But seriously I admire the fact of hearing women’s rights , feminists issues , etc . Honestly  when I watch this, it made me realize how much as you get older , you have to educate and make sure your kids learn to stand on their own , support them , love them , teaching them right and wrong . No matter what happens , know there’s always light at the end of the dark tunnel ❤️ 

We live in a world where we continue to have more problems : socially , physically , academically , politically , it really shows how much as you get older , you have to learn from your mistakes , your parents and everyone else mistakes to make sure you or your love ones , friends and family em members don’t go down the same path . As my family member would say , always learn . Always be open minded , learn and see that life is like a school, there’s always something new to learn . You learn in any area to grow yourself , and your family and community . So don’t stop learning . Learn too grow and your obstacles won’t slow you anything .",0.7664,236
