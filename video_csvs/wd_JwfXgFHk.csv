"I am a Norwegian studying in Denmark and just between two neighboring countries, I have experienced quite a few racial moments. Ranging from ""You come here taking Danish students spots"" to just responding in a kind off Norwegian accent.

"Ok...I was late to the party. I didn't see ""Get Out"" till yesterday and I only knew a little bit about it before then. Certainly nothing about the lead. So when I was telling a relative how much I Loved the movie, he asks if I knew the lead was british...I say, ""No way...his American accent was perfect!""
I then proceed to look for a clip of him speaking...
which brought me here.

Had I not already seen the movie, but found my way here since I do watch many of Colbert's interviews, I would be pissed that it was spoiled in the scene they showed.
His girlfriend turning out to be bad was such a twist for me...I didn't see it coming, and I loved that!

"This film did not deserve best original screenplay!
This is just a reworking of the classic horror film ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975).
In the movie the men in the community turn all the women into submissive slaves. Peele just flip it upside down and made it about whites controlling blacks. Basically its the same story! Even down the the idea that the husband(in peels version, the girlfriend) was in on it from the beginning. 
There was nothing original about this.",-0.9165,95
