Not reading the rest of your long ass reply cause you're starting with an obviously false statement, which tells me the rest isn't even worth my time. All I know is you can't speak English and you are super triggered about the fact that I don't hate the well respected GM Seirawan.",-0.0726,81

"1972? I wasn't alive. How old are you? No offense but I thought you were quite young based on your insults involving (for example) weird fantasies about mothers and sex with animals. I've never known an adult that would think those things are actually offensive to anyone. I don't know if you're bipolar or something but I like your sweet side better. Anyway, if you're genuinely asking why people are so hostile about commentators: You should know that there's ALWAYS someone complaining about commentators. It's either about Maurice or Jen or Christian or Yasser (rarely Yasser though). People always want someone out, or they want someone else in, instead of enjoying the fucking FREE content that this great team provides. If you reproduce this toxicity, you'll attract hostility.   Many of us are just tired of people whining. You like Lyman better than Seirawan? Good for you, it's not going to happen. Ok, you might find some  other negative comments about Seirawan and others. As always, people with hate in their hearts are way louder than people enjoying themselves.  Believe me when I say most people really like Yasser. He's very good at explaining things for beginners, and has good  old stories that stonger players can enjoy.   Just look at the comments under one of his lectures. Or go to the Chessbrah Twitch channel and see how the audience (mostly teens) goes wild when he appears (subscriptions and donations go crazy). You have your own opinion, that's fine.  But at least next time don't express it by focusing on how ""bad"" Yasser is, and try to remind people about how good Lyman was.  What you want won't happen anyway, but at least you won't attract toxicity.",0.9916,329

In fact, it would even be unfair to compared Serena Williams to Hou Yifan as Yifan can and does compete with some male competition and is at least in the top 100 in her sport. Grow up Jen! Stop pandering to the social justice warriors and the mindless PC crowd. If you want to get good at poker some day, you're going to need to learn how to be objective and honest and not let your feminist motivations contaminate the facts.",0.5848,127

"I know Shelby Lyman by reputation (including magazine articles) and it's a good one. Somewhere I saw a film or tape of a show that Shelby did hosting the Fischer-Spassky match in 1972 and this is how I know him- I wasn't there in 1972 but reputations do make the rounds. I just found out that Shelby is 81 and I guess that explains why he isn't doing commentary. Too bad this generation missed seeing him- he was about as good as it gets for this kind of thing,
     As far as 'attracting toxicity' is concerned, it doesn't concern me one little bit- I can dish it out better than you can take it and you know it . I got you to back off and apologize, didn't I? But that's not the point- the point is that not everybody will agree with you nor will you agree with everybody and I think you know that. But people have to learn to disagree without becoming disagreeable. You speak your peace and the other guy speaks his and I think that you know that too. Chess players and fans calling names and swearing? I thought this was an 'intellectual' crowd. Sometimes they sound more like they belong in the back room of a saloon rolling dice, drinking and swearing. Chess players acting like fools and little children over who likes what commentator? How low will they drag this game? Next year, Carlsen defends as does Tan Zhongli and there will  also be a number of tournaments and I hope we get some fantastic chess and even fantastic-er commentary and if there are disagreements and there are bound to be, may they be intelligently expressed.

Now you're saying that every time someone says something they are projecting, lol. You probably didn't even know what the word meant until I explained it to you.

"The idiot who calls himself ""Logic"" You absolutely do not have an IQ of 138, LMAO!. Maybe around half that much. The fact that you don't mention the test you ""claim"" you took makes it clear that you've never even taken a serious IQ test. I am 100% positive that you would score BELOW AVERAGE if you did. There is no question at all about that. You aren't capable of figuring out even the most rudimentary concepts and, as I said before, only copy and past rote words from other people with no understanding on your part at all. You're too stupid for chess, just as you're too stupid for anything else that requires the ability to actually THINK. Only an idiot like you would say that Magnus Carlsen is ""overrated"". That's literally like holding up a sign admitting that you're mentally retarded. No joke. I'm serious. And what provides even more irony is that you know ABSOLUTELY NOT A FUCKING THING about chess! You really can't make this shit up. You're a loser who probably works in the service industry doing mindless bitch work for people like me.",-0.974,215
"The idiot who calls himself ""Logic"". No retard, you misunderstand. I don't ""think"" you're the stupid one. The evidence of your stupidity is incontrovertible! You're wrong about EVERYTHING you ""think"" you know. Chess IS an intelligence game. It's a thinking game in which you win by outsmarting an opponent with equal resources. Although in your case I could take 2 minutes and give you as much time as you wanted and still win easily, and probably also throw in some material as well. The reality is that all the top chess players are extremely intelligent people who could and often do express their high intelligence in other areas. Fischer had an IQ of 187, which is world class, and is also more than double what yours is (probably around triple). Even at the club level, the top players are the most intelligent. The University professors, philosophers, physicists, etc. It's not a coincidence that those people who have proven their intellectual superiority in other areas, also dominate in chess. 

Ironically, you're actually unwittingly providing even MORE evidence of your ignorance and stupidity by mindlessly copying and pasting  mainstream media propaganda which is based on political agenda and not scientific fact. Oh, don't worry, I'm well aware that the last sentence went way over your little head and that you don't have a clue what I'm talking about. It wasn't said for your benefit, lol.

I scored a 142 (which puts me in the top 1%) on a timed and supervised Stanford-Binet psychometric evaluation. I'm a former member of Mensa. I'm also a national master in chess and didn't start competitive rated tournament play until my mid 20's. That's an almost unheard of feat.

 You wouldn't know what a real intelligence test is and probably ""think"" that the online ""tickle test"" is as legit as anything else. There's no point in you lying and claiming that you took one and did well, because I am already 100% positive that you are below average in intelligence. You have made that very very clear. The only thing you know how to do is mindlessly copy and paste someone else's words without understanding anything and without the ability to discern between a legitimate source and one which is biased due to political, monetary, or some other motivation.",0.9673,440

And I do know something about Yasser namely he won the national championship 4 times and I congratulate him for that. But I just do not feel that he is a good host for this show- he talks too quietly and seems to be chatting and gossiping rather than talking chess. do you remember Shelby Lyman from 1972 and '78 hosting the championship coverage for pbs? no comparison- Shelby had it all over Yasser and I have to wonder why he isn't involved with this show. and if you'll read some other comments on this page, you'll see that there are others who don't care for the current commentaries.

Yes, she is not ranked in the top 100 but her ranking is over 2300 which ain't bad and is about 2400 points higher than your i.q. she wrote 2 books and co-authored a third and if you don't like them, that's your right but she did write them and they did sell well. if you happen to think that she won championships when the competition was easier, that's also your right but your argument is with the chess federation and I'm sure that they will rescind any championship that they awarded and you don't approve of-they usually do cater to uneducated name-calling imbeciles and homosexuals. Your own chess accomplishments compared to Jennifer's?

"what In hell are you trying to say? you've made no point- you're just dribbling  which is easily explained by the fact that you've got an i.q.  somewhere around that of a  dead mouse. your comment says nothing. grow up and go back to your garbage can- your mother is lonely and is waiting for you to bang her and your dog is tired of screwing anything as cheap as your mother, so go get some action and knock it off would you, crap-head? I looked into my toilet and saw you so shut it would you? and why do you mention Yasser? just because you picture him naked doesn't mean he'll let you get in his pants so go dribble and go away. peace out, dummy and die so we can use you for mulch which is all you're worth. go away!",-0.9498,160
where can i buy this chess set,0.0,7
wonder what happened to Shelby lyman- did fantastic commentary for pbs. in '72 and '78. Yasser talks too softly-barely audible most times- and he just gabs and gossips. Jennifer is a note-worthy young woman who is not only a champion (national) chess player but also outstanding poker player but Yasser gives her little to work with. jennnifer and Shelby would be a much more interesting combo. Shelby was informative and kept it interesting but this commentary is awful. a major tournament and nothing but gossipy yak-yak. go find Shelby lyman. peace,0.9535,105
"yeah right, this is stupid as fuck, who the hell wants to listen to fucktards like these perfectly-trimmed commentators obstructing our view on games of chestt where 3 moves happen and people want to take a break, stupid shit shouldnt be trending, assholes irl should be playing chess themselves",-0.8917,53
"you can pretend all that you want to but it was you that toned down your childish, unsophisticated disgusting and demented language and it was you that started 'speaking' more politely so it was you that backed off and that constitutes an apology not only to me but also to all the educated and more worldly and mature than you and that's just about everybody- there are prisoners in psycho wards that are more civilized than you and if they saw you or your perverse family coming, they'd  jump out of windows trying to land on their heads. Face it! you're a pervert from a family of perverts! so don't start with childish rantings and ravings again. The issue at hand was my objection and the objection of many many many to Yasser's commentary and also was Jennifer a good choice as contributor? and it was you that turned it into name-calling.
     As far as the rest of your drivel in your latest 'tweet' also known as 'a total waste of time' as is everything that you say or do, who bothers to read it or attempts to understand it? since you're obviously back to acting like a moron. Don't lecture me or anybody like me as you don't have the intelligence to lecture a pile of manure as to how to lie on the ground and rot. As far as thinking that I was an old guy, you said earlier that you thought I was a young guy. You should be careful about mixing pills, cheap weed and bathtub booze. It's obviously eating away at the few brain cells you were born with. Try Vitamin B or maybe Gingko which can be obtained from a health store if you can find one. With your lack of mentality, you might hear somebody say 'The cow mooed' and your feeble brain would think they said 'Stop here for some good food' and you'd wander around in a cow pasture eating cow chips and asking to share their cud and think you're dining at the Ritz.
     Now run away, would you?, your sister's done performing orally on your father and she wants you next so she can compare taste.
     Go Away! You're too stupid to have to deal with. Anybody reading this is so sick of hearing your dribbling goofy 'thoughts' that they probably want to give up chess and start following the international tiddly-winks competition. If Jennifer Shahade reads any of your comments, she'll probably want to become a nun and Yasser will just leave the country so as to never run into you you sexual pervert. With you around, F.I.D.E. will probably disband or regroup as a strip club so as to be able to enjoy normal sexual desires and get rid of the bad taste that you are.
     Now go away and let the rest of us who have higher i.q.'s than maggots, something you could never aspire to, talk about chess and not your sexual perversions and 1000 below zero mentality. Next year and Magnus and Tan Zhongli have title defenses and hopefully you'll fall into a barbeque pit and wind up as dinner for 6 or at least be useful as charcoal. Now once again on behalf of all the people in this world that are at least 25% civilized, a level you and your family of perverts could never hope to achieve, I accept your apology. Now blast off, fool!
     Over and out",-0.9908,643
"you're sick and obviously a patient in a high-risk mental ward and I've no time for you. all your name-calling bounces off me and sticks to you to state it in a way that is at your juvenile level and you're so stupid, you'll probably have to have some little kid explain it after you're done molesting him or her.. and the only genius here is me and I thank you for calling me that. now
     Screw Off!!!",-0.9252,85
