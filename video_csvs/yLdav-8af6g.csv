"Good idea with the handles, now all you need to do is find as way to make it a real laser, I have seen another channel get close to wear it leaves burns from the saber, now you guys should get together and use the burning light with your guys' handles and you guys can bring the movies completely to life, minus the force of course.

I've worked in multiple hardware/paint stores and I know you always want to prep plastics by sanding them before applying paint, even if it's just a scuff sand.
