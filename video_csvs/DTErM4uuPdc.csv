"Another fun fact as Brad mentiones the honey in bear bottles: Since America has no legal provisions on honey or a legal definition for it, the content of these bottles isn't exactly what it seems to be. An investigation of Food Safety News showed that 75% of the honey sold in the U.S. is heavily processed and mixed with sugar, corn syrup and aroma (it's much cheaper that real honey). So if you going to get honey, look for the good stuff at your local beekeeper because the difference is immense.",0.8316,104

"Honey is a humectant, it draws moisture from the air into your skin if you're applying onto your skin. The problems with humectant though is that if the air is dry, it'll pull moisturize from deeper layers in your skin and you can dehydrate your skin that way.

"My girl and I go through 5lbs of local honey every few weeks. We get it from a few different households, we call around and see who's got. One use I must share, aside from our obvious guayusa tea sweetener, is a honey chicken dish. Easy and afuckingmazing. 
   Start a pan with a little oil and toss in a good dose of your hot pepper of choice. It needs to be hot to balance the honey, simmer the peppers a few minutes and then add fresh minced garlic and chopped basil. About a minute later add enough honey to thickly coat the bottom of the pan. I've never measured but probably close to a cup. Stir it together and then let it sit and caramelize. It will bubble up and look like something else, that's perfect. Give it around 3-5 minutes move it around a couple times. Then take it off the heat. This can be put over anything and be awesome. But my favorite way is to add some grilled or pan fried chicken at this point, then spoon it over rice and steamed cauliflower and broccoli.  Im a heavy seasoner usually but this I dish I only salt to taste. At this",0.9753,225

You can have honey that has such a high percentage from a single crop due to the size of the fields that it affects flavor in really interesting ways though such as cotton, almond, chili, etc or target a specific bloom like tupelo in north Florida.",0.8042,116
