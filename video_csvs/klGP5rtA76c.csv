I am sure that the live stream is great but I hope it won't replace the tutorials and quilt snips. Those of us that live in remote areas use satellite internet and have extremely limited data allowances(10-20 GB per month). Live streaming eats that allowance very quickly. We can watch the tutorials by skipping through them to the parts we need to see and the Quilt Snips are wonderful for us as they are so short and to the point. I love Missouri Star and all the inspiration that you provide. Thanks.,0.9789,101

"I didn't like last week nor today's live stream. There's not enough content for us to ask questions or to comment for a live stream. Maybe talk to us about batting or controversial subjects like starch or basting sprays? There's too much lag time in the beginning and end of the replays, really shows an amateur production. Really a waste of my time right now, but I'll still subscribe to see the regular videos. xoxo from sunny 🌞 Arizona, 72/41 today.",0.7135,90

Loved your idea!! Made a ton of them since watching. I did place 2 of the bottom pieces wrong side together before adding the top. This gave it a little more body and provided a lining for the holder at the same time. Not able to watch live on Tuesdays but am so looking forward to your next tutorial. Thanks MSQC!!!,0.7794,70
