"Dont understand the underestimation of V.R. in the lives of humans in 10 years. A technology that can alter reality as we know it and put you into ANY situation would to me be the next step in human elevation. Learning a different language and culture while in that country interacting with people in VR, doing a CAD design and seeing all angles of how it will operate in the world in VR and doing that conference call in the other persons office half way around the country or the world in V.R not to mention actually setting in the scene of a movie. How could that not be the biggest change in 10 years?  Bitcoin will be the new currency in the V.R. world and governments will do everything they can to control and regulate it as Trillions will be exchanged daily. Sex will be more and more artificial with V.R., A.I. and robots feeding into any fantasy with a click of the on button. Bulky headset will be reduced down to the size of a large pair of sunglass which can then be worn anywhere and allow you to enter the V.R. world at any time even while your self driving car takes you where you want to go at the same time.

Since scientists at the moment are still learning when it comes to anything to do with the human brain, it will be at least 50+ years before there is a technology in testing that can do that kind of stuff. 100+ years before it‚Äôs closer to being commercialised.

4. Yes I do beleive there will still be Star Wars movies being released by disney, but i beleive that the die hard fans of the Expanded Universe are going to have a harder time enjoying this new story they are creating
5. Yes of course, theres just something about actually going out to stores thats more enjoyable than online surfing, but i beleive stores will be threatened by online VR shopping technology.
6. If it is still around it is either struggling, on the very brink of death
7. Yes
8. No absolutely not, i think that if artificial intelligence his showing some kind of threat it will be taken care of rather quickly
8. YES! People love going to the movies
9. I sure hope that driverless cars do not outnumber the cars driven by humans, because what will happen if an emergency. Ex, what if your about to hit a kid who unexpectedly ran onto the road and you cant slow down fast enough to stop, and your only alternative is swerving out of the way which will 100% cause your death. Do you really want a machine making that decision for you?
9. Uhhh... yea!! Us Americans love our football. I dont see it dying any time soon.
10. Absolutely not, unless the government decides to direcyly control the news, but even then there would still be fake news.
11. I think so, but i think that if they do go then newspapers would go first but I dont think either will disapear completely
12. Entertainment as in strictly in the feild of films and shows? No. Overall entertainment? Also No. But VR will be popular
