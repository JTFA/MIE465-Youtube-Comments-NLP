"""Be a tourist in your own city"" is a motto I totally live by. I have a lot of friends from my home town who never got to take advantage of all the cool sights to see and things to do in my city because it all seemed boring or ""normal"" to them. I've always been a big fan of trying out everything cool my home has to offer—tourist fun with the local insight to know how to ration your $$$ haha",0.9325,92

"I live in New York and the subway will take all of your money. An unlimited pass for 1 week is $30 alone and the prices keep going up. WALK as much as possible. You can take rest stops but you can literally cross over from one neighborhood to the next in a couple of minutes. You can walk from the Financial District to the Brooklyn Bridge. From the Brooklyn Bridge to DUMBO (Brooklyn). Soho to Union Square. Also always look for free museum/pay-what-you-wish days to save money. You’ll have something to do everyday. To save money on quick bites definitely buy from the carts or go into a bodega. Highly recommend eating well before going into neighborhood like Soho because it’s mostly filled with moderately to highly priced cafes and restaurants. I worked in soho and always brought food from home to save money.

Also to save money on public transportation!! Use your transfers. You get one FREE transfer from train to bus or bus to bus within an hour (may be 2 hours but check the MTA website).",0.992,207
