It has been repeatedly shown that the right will resort to lies and gotchas to discredit Dems. Just look at the little bitch that got hired by the right to lie to WAPO and claim that Roy Moore impregnated her and then forced her to have an abortion. WAPO couldn't confirm her statements and so didn't report the story. It shows though that the right has no conscience.
