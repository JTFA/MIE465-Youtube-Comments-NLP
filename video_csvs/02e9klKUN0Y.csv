"Hello there, thanks for replying. I now understand. One last question. How much is the shelf life of your vodka? As a guy who mainly buys vodka to create cocktails, your brand and let's be fair many other brands too, feels like a gamble when I buy from the liquor stores/supermarkets. Most of the times the vodka goes bad on the shelves of the store! Any tips to differentiate it?",0.7142,82

No worries! You can keep your Absolut in good condition by simply keeping it at room temperature and avoiding heat and light. Given these conditions your bottle of Absolut Vodka should meet your expectations of a quality product for several years. Our flavoured vodkas are more sensitive and to be experienced at their best ought to be consumed within two years of purchase.,0.2481,67

"You might want to do some research.  McSwiggan was featured on the Stonewall website for a number of years.   Following his conviction for violence and unfounded accusations of homophobia, he was removed from the site permanently.

If Stonewall are happy to be associated with him, you explain the above.

They are not the only charity to do this.  You will find all sorts of videos on his channel talking about his charitable work, but when you attempt to find them acknowledging his work, these organisations no longer want to be involved.

Absolut have long stood up for LGBT causes.  Perhaps you should review which allies they choose to stand alongside and when jumping to the defence of someone, at least present more than a snapshot of the truth.

Sorry Absolut but this is not good enough.",-0.4069,150
