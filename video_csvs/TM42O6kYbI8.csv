If you actually study the history of acting and the phrase “method acting” you’ll know that this current fetish of living as the character offscreen as well is not method acting. It’s forming a new persona and not acting in method but the initial point of method acting was to create a method in which you perform in the scene as someone else not yourself in a role. Long story short what’s being called method acting now is actual more akin to reactionary performance and not method acting as it was defined by its creators.,0.4939,106

only really showed Leo and for 1 sec spoke of Ledger  and Daniel Day. You  than told me how Tom Cruise is not a method actor like no1 knew that lol.
