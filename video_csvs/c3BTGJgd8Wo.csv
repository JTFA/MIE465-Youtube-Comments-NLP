"Ashanti is a very pretty woman. However, her somewhat demise in the industry was not just because of Murder Inc.’s indictment. She doesn’t have a great vocal range and doesn’t possess the best dance skills. With that being said, I’ve bought a few of her albums if not all of them but her time was up. Honestly, she hasn’t really elevated her craft at all. She is in the rankings or a bit below a Keyshia Cole or K. Michelle. Perhaps even a level below Tinashe or Kelani.",0.8199,110

Ashanti is married to her mother it’s pitiful she needs to grow up & become a woman. She will never have children or marriage. Nothing is wrong loving your parents but when do you grow up & become an independent woman. She a sad woman to have so much going for her but allowing her mother be the man she needs.

"I hope everyone notice the bs segue that CTG made when they started talking about her movie Stuck. The movie is about different ethnic groups  and cultures stuck on a train going at each other on a hot summer day or night. But he switches the topic and they avoid delving into the real issue of race relations which the movie is about. They made the majority of her interview about these alleged accusations. Most of these allegations made by these women, just like the Cosby case, are bs. They use all these distractions to prevent us from focusing on what really matters.",-0.3832,111
