I hope the next generation of actors and actresses see this and get inspired. Or just about anyone, really. We can all use an extra ""oomph"" of motivation.",0.9687,101

"Oh my gosh, i’ve seen the movie twice now and I am just totally in love with it. (i’m binge viewing spoiler reviews along with all the documentaries with a second sight now that I’ve seen the film). I think it takes twice to really let everything sink in. Some initial shocks and minor cringes are overridden by the ultimate fan love of Star Wars and I think Rian Johnson did an amazing job and the acting is phenomenal. Adam driver’s performance is piercing. And that’s just the top of the list for me; I really don’t think there was a bad acting job in the whole film it was all inspiring and spectacular!
