"Here my take: Bree versus Maggie? Maggie being artist, Bree being baker? I don't know why they would do this...aren't they same creativity pool?  Do you do drawing like everyday maybe you should try it, maybe Bree might hire Maggie who knows?  Sometimes I think people are just too quick to judge? Oh yes they are enemies...no I hate this person why do even say it. Creativity people are just creative, baker isn't too far off artist, they create food, while artist spins off ideas and make them actual written art pictures. I don't know maybe one day we see it happen?  My idea is not just bad idea to see more of these kind of versus, I like to see firefighter versus BBQ cook hey. or absentminded...it be interesting...",0.9047,153

"Just because you like Maggie don't mean you have to discredit the art of Bree. Both are artist and in this art of cake decor, Bree is the best, because she has more practice. While in imaginative creation Maggie might just win. This was a competition after all don't pretend it wasn't.",0.9169,58
