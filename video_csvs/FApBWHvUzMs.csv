It’s been a really bad case of hero worship mixed with hopelessness about not being able meet said hero. I don’t know what to do, as things made by this person no longer make me happy because of the horrible unrequited sense of longing I feel. Something I love feels as if it’s been ruined for me and I don’t know what to do. It’s dumb, but it’s just not leaving me. It feels like a mental leech. Can you please help me?",0.7996,137

Make like a week in the next we’ll week..... where all your videos are sanders sides! You to do like five sanders sides please there’s not enough there’s no where Near enough sanders sides from my perspective you don’t post them to often it’s like you’ve given. Up on them. There must be more to see with the most previously posted sanders sides could Virgil be one of the dark ones as Roman calls them? Could there be more? So far we have basically have Patton’s evil side what about Logan’s could his evil side be the side of of Thomas that questions all things that make sense??? And Roman his evil side is probably the side of Thomas that has no  creativity and that uses imagination and hopes and dreams to make you feel pointless like you shouldn’t be dreaming about things you should be doing them or finding out ways to do the impossible his power is maybe he will force you to think about what your not doing and what you could be doing he might be like Vergil he might make you question your every move he makes you think imagination is a waste of time!,0.8031,228

Thing about the penny being made of copper it’s actually quite fascinating if I’m remembering my facts right that during world war 2 America was running out of nickel and silver and iron that was used in all coins including pennys so what they did was cut the amount of metal used in pennys by replacing the more precious metals with copper if my memory is correct that is he reason,0.4188,75

I don’t know if you live in the same area as me but I’m posting this anyway. My brother works at Waffle House. He got two prank calls today, both times it was the same person calling as Stewie Griffin. First time he hung up. Second time, the person yelled, “I WANT PANCAKES,” as Stewie Griffin. I thought I would post this just in case you live nearby, and you posted a prank call video and it was you, I would have this comment beforehand as proof. If I’m wrong then this will be stupid. I know there are other people in my area who know how to do a Stewie Griffin voice, this is just in case. Thanks, bye.",-0.6758,186
