"First off, what an adorable little one with you 😘

Secondly, this has happens for me also 😬
I live in Ohio USA
We have lots of insects in the summer because we have woods on our land that they love to congregate around. 
I use different ""Ohm"" tones.
Sometimes they just completely leave the area 😳
They always come back tho 😞
So fascinating how nature interacts with us but most humans BARELY notice. 
That's why I was happy to see this post.
SOMEONE noticed 👍🏻😁Namaste 🙏🏼",0.8979,100

"I actually thought this too the first time I saw the behaviour when I was in the UK, but I've seen them react at distance. On one occasion I saw them reacting to a dog barking some 50 metres away from the swarm.",0.0,46
"I don't think that this is what's happening given how far away they are and how quickly they are reacting. No matter how good their sense of smell is, they can't smell something that hasn't reached them yet.",0.129,41
"I know you are asking James S, but here's a little reading regarding response to sound that someone else at Reddit mentioned to me (which also makes me think this is not CO2 related) . https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/7/570/268256",0.0,39
"I watched that piano video a few weeks back, very cool. Someone over at Reddit suggested something similar to what you mentioned (perhaps it was you?). Sounds entirely plausible and makes a lot of sense as different pitches tend to result in varying effects in their flight pattern, I seem to remember a lower pitch put them into what looked like a slow motion mode of their regular skittish flight but I didn't capture that so well. Someone else also suggested that it is a mechanism to evade bats that are using echolocation to hunt and there are some scientific studies that back this up. It's possible to levitate objects with sound, so if an object is already in flight then it also makes sense that sound vibrations in the air could effect their flight pattern and cause a gnat to rise upwards or slow its flight.",0.6766,158
I've always thought it related to gases coming out of the ground or plant aromas. Maybe they also like the magnetic fields from power lines?,0.3612,27

Hi 👋🏼 
Do you have a reference to your statement that explains the fundamentals of these insects reacting to breath smell versus tone??
Because I don't know if that's accurate information. 
I'd like to find out for sure by reading the same information as you explaining and proving your statement. 
Thanks 👍🏻😃",0.7941,61
"James S Can't be. Scents are not transferred through the air instantaneously to cause the nats to react instantly. Rather smells diffuse rather slowly.
This reaction is more likely due to the changes in the air pressure as the man speaks which affect the nats flight.",-0.296,50

"My guess would be that their flying wing frequency is very sensitive and responsive to related frequencies (although obviously at much different octaves) in much the same way that piano wires react to each other to make piano notes involve more than just one wire vibrating. A recent video was made about the topic ""sympathetic resonance."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHWex94-mHg",0.7239,63

Obviously he's discovered reversed CGI.  Bravo.,0.0,8
"Small flying insects like this have an unbelievable sense of smell, far more sensitive than any other known animal. What they are reacting to is the smell of your breath as you exhale whilst speaking, hence why the effect is unchanged by the loudness of your voice as the effect is undiminished by you speaking at a normal volume.",0.5106,63
Thankyou... he is a cute little munchkin isnt he. So true about most people not noticing this sort of thing but it just comes naturally to me to look a little closer than most. Glad there are others in the world who look through the same type of eyes. :),0.8646,54

do you know why gnats group together in a swarm like this? i always see them randomly on the side of the road or next to a power pole. they just seem to gather in that one spot for no reason,0.0772,43
