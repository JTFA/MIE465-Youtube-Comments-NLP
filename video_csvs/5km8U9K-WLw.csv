"i think all the people who were complaining about this are the real racists because if color really doesnt matter to them then why do they think its not ok for a black boy to wear that hoodie ? just because hes black? do they think he looks more like a monkey ? THAT is racist. ....its like saying oh no little boy, that hoodie is not for you, you look too similar to a monkey , its for the white boys only...sorry ....unbelievable üòí",-0.8269,92

"little tiny Well, Little Tiny if you do some digging into the real history of your people you will find that it's you (White People) that have stolen just about everything you have. You've stolen from Black People and others all sorts of inventions and technology and passed it off as your own. I mean damn, you only took the most famous man ever to walk the Earth and made him White. It's the biggest case of identity theft EVER! You all have no shame. You're pathetic. NOT all of you because I do believe there are some really good, individual White People in the world but your people as a whole are the worst on the planet. Everything you touch you destroy",-0.9597,135
"little tiny ü§îI guess that was supposed to hurt, anger me? You failed miserably. 

Maybe a few years ago that word would have upset me but not today...not anymore. 

God's Chosen People were called ""Nigger"" but spelled with one ""G"" instead of two but, that's just the white man adding to God's word as he does with ALL Scripture. 

Acts 13:1 KJVS
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

And just in case your simple ass try to pronounce the word like ""Tiger"", let me save you the time. The word is pronounced, Neeger and you can look it up. I'm assuming you are capable of researching things? But, in case you are a bigger idiot than even I think you are, I'll just show you myself.

Is that simple enough? Or, do you need more help?

Yes, I'm a Niger, meaning ""black"". The same as the Saints and Prophets of The Most High God. 

The real joke is on you. You mistreat his people and believe you won't pay for it.
