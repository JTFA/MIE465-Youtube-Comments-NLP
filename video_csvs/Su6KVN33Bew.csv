"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  

Jesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... 

Jesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.

Jesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV

Acts 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV

Jesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP

Jesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP

Romans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV

Romans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV

1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV

And REPENT...

Acts 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP

Jesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP

1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV

From what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.

Please get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…

And don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.

Some great scriptures to look up and read below:

1 Corinthians 6:9-11
1 Corinthians 15:1-4
1 John 3:7-15
Micah 6:8
Acts 17:3
Acts 18:5
John 4:25-26
Mark 14:61-62
Revelation chapters 20-22
The entire New Testament
