(He either didn’t pay her because he’s stingy, or because he doesn’t want any other women he cheated with, or will cheat with to get any ideas.) He then paraded his kids and her on all his social media the very next day. It was dirty. And yes, I stand by what she said, “now what is she supposed to do?” Leave her baby daddy?

"Milly Borkovic that is not what i said at all but read what you want, since it seems like that's what you wanna do . I don't know in what utopia you live  to think that people would hate him JUST ( as bad as it is) because he cheated on his wife. This country elected a man to the higher office when he was accused by multiple women of abuse and harassment and the list goes on. The biggest moguls of the movie and entertainment industry are monstrous misogynist, racist or even pedophile and they're still praised. I'm a feminist but also a realist. If I were to hate every single men who acted as a chauvinistic pig, I wouldn't watch entertainment, period. I'd rather hate the Weinstein's, the Cosby's, the Trump' s of this world ( ffs Woody Alllen married the daughter he raised !) instead of wasting my energy on a man who made his fame on adultery, when the only person concerned, his wife, doesn't even give a shit. And all I said to begin with is : don't throw rapist and cheaters in the same bin. I suffered both,  one hurt me for sure but the other one litteraly DESTROYED me growing up. Just be careful in your phrasing. But be my guest, keep your vendetta against Kevin Hart if you have that kind of energy. I don't.",-0.9897,258

It was also a clever ploy so no other women he has cheated with or will cheat with will get any ideas about going public. The day it came out publicly and the days following he posted her and his kids all over snapchat pretending to be “happy families” it was one of the most cringeworthy things I’ve ever witnessed to exploit your pregnant wife and kids like that.
