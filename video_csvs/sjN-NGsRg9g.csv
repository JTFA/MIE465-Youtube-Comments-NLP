"I honestly never knew LINKIN PARK very well. Their music was amazing, but they were that type of band I listened to on the radio and If I knew the song I would sing along and then move on. Heck I didn't even know about his death until October literally 5 days after I lost my best friend. Losing someone close always hurts and now that I know a man who was so inspiring as him has left us, it'll leave a mark on those who knew him. God bless Chester and all of his band mates. If LINKIN PARK ever comes to Tennessee you can bet I'll be there ready for all of their amazing talent.",0.9735,125

"I'd like to share a thought. I love linking park and Pop (in the wide sense) music. I am not a fan of classical music. But don't you think that comparing classical music to Pop (rock, folk, pop and so on) is a bit like comparing Shakespeare to JKRoling?
What I mean is,  the classical music is art. Does the Pop music (which is a very semplified music compared to classical) classify as art too iyo?",0.8689,91
