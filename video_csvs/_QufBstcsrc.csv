This doesn't take away from Morgan's achievements where he pursued a career of acting during serious cultural stigmas against African Americans. From playing a role as a cab driver to a movie star. He is a real inspiration to a generation of actors/young people of color and a pioneer in African American cinema. He isnt just any celebrity. His award takes nothing away from the appreciation we give hard working policemen, firemen, nurses etc.",0.9153,94
