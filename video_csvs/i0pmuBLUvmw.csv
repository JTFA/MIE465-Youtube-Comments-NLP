"One of my best friends is of the 10 percent of the blind community that actually can't see anything but pitch blackness and I've heard of places like this that tries to show people with sight what it's like eating a dinner as a blind person and I've heard mixed reviews about it but a lot of the time the people who are blind that go to these restraunts become mildly offended by how seriously uneducated they are about how to politely deal with guiding a blind person and giving them a legitimate resteraunt experience without singling them out and making them feel weird. For example, the menu situation. Most places have menu's and most of the time these menu's can be read by the host or hostess to the blind person so that they know what is available to them and what they would like. I've even gone to some restraunts (not many) that provide a brail menu in which the blind partrients can read the menu themselves without the help of a sighted person. To be completely honest, I find this particular resteraunt rather offensive because they are not at all giving a real experience to what it's like for blind people to go out to resaraunts. Like, Molly said. It's weird first of all, that they didn't even HAVE a menu basically insinuating that blind people can't pick their own food (?) and also that apparently most of the hosts or hostesses don't know how to properly lead a blind person to a place to sit. In fact, in my personal experience as a blind person ""leading"" someone (sighted or blind) is generally done by latching arm- elbow fold (I don't really know how to explain that). It's how ANYONE should be leaded to their seat anywhere. It's a polite way of leading someone to where they should go seat, car, ect. because, like Molly said and I completely agree.. It's WEIRD holding someone that I have never met's hand and having them more or less drag me to where I need to be instead of politely leading me to where I need to be. It becomes less formal and more like a child holding mommy and daddy's hand to lead them across the street so as to not get hit by a car. It's associated with childhood experiences and it's VERY informal and in my personal opinion, VERY rude. If you want to know what it feels like to eat dinner as a blind person. Use a blind fold or go into a pitch black room and have someone serve you dinner. Rather than going to a restaraunt like this and giving some uneducated business your money to get the same experience you would get if you had someone hand you a plate  of food at a table blind folded.",-0.9863,511
