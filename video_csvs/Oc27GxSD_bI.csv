"That's actually why fiberglass is so strong. They make glass fibers which are absolutely perfect and then immediately coat them to prevent them getting any damage whatsoever. Then when they encase the woven fibres in a polymer matrix it strengthens it, particularly under tension (but also somewhat under compression- the fibers are super strong under compression, provided they don't buckle, and the matrix stops that.) But a wine glass that has never, ever been touched should be as strong. It may well be that the glass you broke, broke where it did, because that's where you had been handling it the most and you'd created microscratches there.",0.9524,121
"That's really good. What you should also try is putting some water on your fingers and running one around the rim of the glass and making a sound. Also, when you change the amount of water in the glass, it changes the frequency. This can teach a lot of physics principles. And if you do a camera closeup of the water in the glass, sometimes you can see it vibrating or oscillating with the glass.

There used to be many choirs that did this in their performances. There are still some. It was ver popular during Benjamin Franklin's lifetime. He was so intrigued by this that he invented the glass harp or glass harmonica. There are still a few performers who use one today. Just do a search on YouTube and you will find a number of them.

Finally, Paul McCartney, one of the Beatles, demonstrated on PBS about 8 years ago how he used singing wine glasses to create some of the sounds he used. Maybe you can find that on PBS. It was quite interesting. Somebody told me that there is a manufacturer in England that makes glasses specifically for this purpose.

"Would love to see how close the frequency of your voice was when the glass broke.  (Maybe using Audacity) How did this frequency compare with the frequency when you strike the glass and listen.

How did this compare with the frequency in your other attempts?

What if you use a speaker to play a recording of your voice (for the time you broke the glass).  At what decibel level does the glass break.  Or for what duration for a fixed decibel level will the glass break?

What if you used the speaker with your voice recording (or play back sound of the glass resonating). And ""break in"" the glass so that you could break the glass more easily with your actual voice.

Edit:
the engineer is wrong. if you use a high speed camera you'll see the glass flexing. a professional singer does it much faster, and if you look at his high speed you'll see that the glass flexes more and more violently until it breaks at the stress point. so the issue is how loud you have to be. at the right pitch you can be quite a bit softer. this is a principle used in different sorts of explosive weapon systems.
