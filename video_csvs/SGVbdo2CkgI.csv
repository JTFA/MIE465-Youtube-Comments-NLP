Pixel Fyxe Designers usually become known because of their pieces. Victoria is in the unique position that she was already a household name. I think she‚Äôs done pretty well to be seen as a Designer in an industry that is notoriously snobby. I know she doesn‚Äôt sketch or physically participate in the production but I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs very hands on with her team and she does have great fashion sense. If her designs were poor or the quality wasn‚Äôt great she wouldn‚Äôt be as successful as she is. Credit where credits due. And she comes across really well.,0.9783,117
