"2 errors - In the event of a depressurisation aircraft will typically descend rapidly to 14,000ft (unless terrain is a factor) where passenger/cabin crew oxy will no longer be needed, however they will stay at that altitude to the limits of the cockpit oxygen (usually hours) then descend further to 10,000ft where they will remain there until destination. - All of this to save fuel. Secondly - There is no control of the electronic locks for the cabin doors in the cockpit.

Basically the rounded edges means that the stress flows more smoothly around the windows avoiding a point of concentrated stress. You were quite correct that the shape reduces the chances of cracking though. I hope you find this useful, and I just want to help make your content as accurate as possible.",-0.0612,130

"I'm a pilot so I can answer some of those questions:

-As for eardrums rupturing/blacking out, I do not believe this is the case. In several accidents involving explosive decompressions, blacking out was not seen. I'm not a doctor though, so don't take my absolute word for this answer.

-Again, nope. The main risk is with the lack of oxygen, and although there is a large pressure difference, it is not enough to cause your bodily fluids to boil, or seperate the dissolved gases in your blood/cells.

-The outside air temperatures at the cruising altitudes for a modern airliner can range between -30 and -45 degrees celsius. The at 14,000 feet, which is the altitude where a pilot would normally level off after an emergency descent, the temperatures would be closer to between 0 and -15 degrees celsius. It's cold and uncomfortable, but nowhere close enough for you to freeze. You'll be fine.

-This question depends on the severity of the damage. A small hole in the aircraft will not have a noticeable affect on the aerodynamics or controlability of the aircraft. The real problem here is with associated system failures related to the door failure and decompression. I'll leave a second reply to this where I'll explain it in detail.

-When the fuselage is opened, all of the pressurized air in the cabin will rush towards that point to balance the interior and exterior pressure. In theory, this would cause the hole to expand to the point where the aircraft would lose it's structural integrity and incur further damage (think of someone hitting a balloon with a knife). The reason this is not the case is because the difference in pressures is not large enough to do this. Even then aircraft are fitted with special ""dado vents"" which open during a decompression to help with the transfer of pressure between the pressurized and unpressurized parts of the aircraft, reducing stress on the airframe.",-0.9789,371

I thought it could be an interesting video idea :)",0.3803,125
"So regarding the controllability of the aircraft, here are some details regarding that.

In modern aircraft, lots of systems rely on pipes/cables/wires that are embedded in the floor, ceiling, and walls of the aircraft. These controls are responsible for a variety of thinks, like containing pressurized hydraulic fluid used to move the control surfaces. Back in the old days (like the early 70s), hydraulic fluid was the only thing between the pilots and the controls, and without it there was no way to easily control the aircraft. Without hydraulics, you could turn the control column all you want and nothing would happen.

In the early 70s, McDonnell Douglas came out with the brilliant aircraft, the DC-10. Beautiful aircraft, but it's safety record was kind of...iffy. The DC-10 had a cargo door that would open outwards instead of the traditional inwards opening door. The great thing about a door that opens inwards is that as the aircraft pressurizes, the force of the cabin air pushes the door into the frame (like a plug in a drain), so it was impossible for it to open in flight. McDonnell Douglas worked around this by putting a huge series of locks on their door, which would hold it in place.

In 1972, a DC-10 operating as American Airlines flight 96 was climbing out when the cargo door blew out. Structurally speaking, the aircraft was fine, but the force of the escaping air collapsed a part of the cabin floor, severring several control cables and hydraulic lines. The engine on the tail was stuck at full power, the rudder on the tail fin was stuck deflected to one side, and the other controls were slow to respond to inputs since some of the hydraulics systems were knocked out. The captain made an emergency landing, and everyone survived. Turns out that the locks douglas had made were flawed, which meant the cargo door locking indicators would show the door as ""locked"" even though the locks were only partially engaged. Recommendations were made to McDonnell Douglas to fix the design of the locking mechanism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_96

2 years later, another DC-10 operating as Turkish Airlines flight 981 was climbing out of Paris when the same thing happened. Structurally speaking, the aircraft was in a perfectly flyable state, but whereas AAL96 only lost 2 of its 3 hydraulic systems, flight 981 lost all 3. The aircraft entered a steep dive, and crashed shortly after. The cause was found to be the same, a faulty locking mechanism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_981

Now after having thoroughly scared you, I can assure you that many changes were implemented after flight 981. The locking mechanism was redesigned with added redundancies, and those dado vents I mentioned earlier were made standard to relieve any sort of pressure difference, which would stop the floors from collapsing in of another decompression incident. Although not directly because of flight 981, hydraulic fuses were made standard on aircraft a short while later, which would shutoff the flow of hydraulic fluid to certain areas if a leak was detected. This meant that control could still be maintained if hydraulic pressure was lost. Modern aircraft like the 737 even feature mechanical reversion, which means the pilots can move the controls via cables if all the hydraulic systems are lost (although it does take a lot more strength). For modern day airliners, losing a door is ""no biggie"". Okay yeah it is still a big deal but the planes are able to take it.

My point is that the door itself does not affect the aircraft's structural integrity, but the damage can knock out other systems. Modern day aircraft feature so many redundancies that it's not an issue, and the aircraft can still be flown perfectly well. Aviation is so safe because after every accident, massive changes are made to help keep passengers safe.",0.978,733

"Thank you ....I always wondered especially when I'm in the plane and  it's time to go to sleep,the lights are off and  and there's the door  accessible to any   banana nutcase  to go and Open it .I have seen lost like 20 times and just the thought of plane breaking in half and drowning in the ocean terrifies me especially when I can't swim .I know flying is safe but stuck in a tube with 400 people 6,000 ft in air nowhere to run  doesn't give a relief of no never mind .especially  with what's happening in the World they should put law enforcement  in uniform and without uniform so no one even entertains the idea of social media fame or quick buck scam .",-0.7601,131

"That is why you need to ENJOY ever second, minute, hour because the possibility of dying  through various avenues such a airplane door opening is likely but highly unlikely.

"The contention at 0:46 that the chances of survival are very slim because of the plane breaking apart is not quite correct; witness UAL 811, which returned safely after such an incident (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_811) or even Aloha Airlines Flight 243 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_Airlines_Flight_243) which retuned safely after half of its roof was ripped off.

Survivability in such cases is quite high; the people ejected out are usually those who took their seat belts off. This is why I, as a pilot, always announce ""I strongly urge you to keep your seat belts on in flight, even if the signs have been switched off"". In a few cases, where the entire floor section is ripped away, that's when passengers are sucked out for no fault of their own.",0.34,142

"The point in 0:21 about gravity is wrong. Gravity barely decreases over that distance. If there was no gravity decrease there would still be a pressure difference. Quite the same as with a pool of water. The real reason why the pressure lowers is because there is simply less air on top of were the plain in flying than when you are on the ground. This reduced amount of air mass above results in a lower pressure. 

Furthermore, the main reason the windows are rounded is because this eliminates mechanical weak points at the corners of the windows.The earliest high altitude planes did not have this which resulted in cracks at the corners.

Normally you make good videos, but I'm disappointed that you looked over these  points.",-0.8802,137
"The reason for thicker atmosphere at lower altitudes isn‚Äôt really down to the increased gravity. The proportion difference in radius from the centre of the earth is negligible, imagine a layer of varnish on a globe model. It‚Äôs more to do with the amount of molecules above those at lower altitudes. The same density gradient could be observed even if the force of gravity was constant throughout all altitudes.",-0.3182,78
"The windows are rounded to prevent stress concentrations, in early aircraft the windows were square and cracks formed in the corners from fatigue due to the cyclical loading. Drag has nothing to do with the window shape, they are flush with the skin of the Aircraft.",-0.6808,50
"This didn't answer the questions I would have put, which are:
- Due to this rapid decompression, would my eardrums break, would my vision black out, would I fall unconscious?
- Would my body liquids boil / gases come out of solution so that cell membranes or blood vessels would rupture?
- Would I lose enough heat due to the temperature drop that I'd freeze?
- Once the pressure has been equalised, how does the opening in the shell affect aerodynamics and control, depending on air speed, altitude, type of plane and size of the door?
- How exactly would this cause the plane to break apart?
- What is special about skydiving planes so that they can do this safely?",0.7105,136
