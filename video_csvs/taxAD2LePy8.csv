I use as much KVD as I can.  Actually, besides skin care, I don’t use much outside her brand, because the quality and price are exceptional, on top of the fact that she, and her brand, openly support women and actively support animal relief programs. Get it girl, get it.  She doesn’t have a foundation shade for me, as a super pale lady with golden undertones, but her powder and eyeshadows are just amazing quality.  I didn’t know what I was missing until I tried her shit.  If you’re a working lady who is expects her eyeshadow to last all day, get her shade and light palette.",0.9265,178
