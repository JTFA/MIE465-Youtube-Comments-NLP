"I love winter for all the reasons the subject mentioned. So beautiful. The bleakness has a wonder and awe to it as well, all under the blanket of a sleek ebony and silver night sky, with so many familiar but distant friends from winters past: Orion, the Dippers... great and luminous nights to behold the joy of the whole Earth, the Cosmos and its appointed rounds.",0.9711,75
"I've heard that you spend a lot of time with your boyfriend on the island and a lot of time off the island in the winter at art exhibitions and the like, as well as getting weekly deliveries of supplies from the mainland, so I'm wondering about the choice of title for this doc.",0.5574,57
"I've lived in New Hampshire for 7 years. Putting this place on my list next Summer. Stay warm, Alexandra. Thank you!",0.5707,26
If there was a piano in that place I would spend my time learning all of Bach's Goldberg Variations. Technology has made it difficult for us to sit quietly. People fidget without their devices. I especially loved her comments about how the buildings themselves have been witnesses to all that has come and gone...,0.4005,58

"Solitude is many people’s fear including mine. I would like to accept the fact that I might end up being alone, without having any fear. This video is really inspiring and helpful.",0.4323,38

"This documentary really touched me as someone who’s divided about solitude. I enjoyed it, and often need it, but it has made me suffer many times. Beautifully shot, elegantly edited. Documentaries like this one are hard to come across in places like YouTube.",0.9042,52
"This is brilliant. I really enjoy the beautiful, well-connected shots and the calm speech of Alexandra. Also, the subtle music really make this video even better. I'll put this on my ""Favourites"" playlist, and I can tell you, there aren't that many videos on there as it happens very rarely that I encounter such a nice piece on this site. Well done, keep it up!",0.9676,77
This is haunting. I really enjoyed it. Beautifully done!,0.7749,12

What a great film. Thank you for this contribution!,0.784,11
"Whether this level of solitude is for you is probably a question of temperament, interests and where you're coming from in life. I like peace and quiet myself, but this might be too much of a good thing. Personally, I'd probably need to talk to or at least exchange emails with someone at least a couple of times during winter.",0.81,66
