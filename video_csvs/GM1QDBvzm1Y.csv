"WalkofMan Love Tiff too. The concept is actually quite brilliant. It addresses an issue that many American's are passionate about - the epidemic of small, ""mom and pop"" family-owned businesses that once fueled the American economy going out of business due to big box retail. Big box stores (franchises) like Wal-Mart and Walgreens have run them out of business. Hardly anymore locally family-owned pharmacies, eye-glass shops, five and dime, ice cream shops. etc. That's why so many picket the opening of a new Wal-Mart in their communities. It destroys the locals from owning businesses and the sense of pride it used to build. People are really passionate about this issue because big box runs the ""little guys"" out of business.",0.9468,139
