Isn't that twisted to be saying in a song that many people will look up to? Saying that you aren't anyone until you have someone is horrible to say to your fans cause many will end up believing it. Just a thought",-0.5423,64

"Demi Lovato Tell Me You Love Me Lyrics 

Oh no, here we go again
Fighting over what I said
I'm sorry, yeah I‚Äôm sorry
Bad at love, no, I'm not good at this
But I can't say I‚Äôm innocent
Not hardly, but I'm sorry

And all my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I got it bad, baby
Got it bad

Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

And I hope I never see the day
That you move on and be happy without me
Without me
What‚Äôs my hand without your heart to hold?
I don‚Äôt know what I'm living for
If I‚Äôm living without you

All my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I've got it bad, baby
I got it bad

Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say
You ain‚Äôt nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
My heart's like
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

Everything I need
Is standing in front of me
I know that we will be alright, alright, yeah
Through the ups and downs
Baby, I'ma stick around
I promise we will be alright, alright

Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this

"Love this song, rings so true for me, Demi if u read this, I have been a fan from the beginning and your current music is AMAZING, I was in a bad relationship with a very abusive man, had a son, so I felt I had to stay for him, my friends warned me, but I clndt or wldnt listen.  Then I found my saving Grace, my husband and we will be married 14 years but, even though he isn't unfaithful, or physically, emotionally and physiologically  abuse me, we have grown so far apart we now have a son together 15 and he adopted my oldest 20 US Army Solider, I Love him, I am in Love with him, but I don't think he is still in Love with me.  I don't blame him, as in 2010 I had to have a complete hysterectomy due to endometriosis and needless to say it has been nightmare for everyone since, then I found out I had Hashimotos an auto-immune disease of my Thyroid, well had to have a Thyrpoidectomy, let me point out I have always been about 100-110lbs, between the hysterectomy and thyroidectomy I have gained close to 70lbs and it is so overwhelmingly mentally and physically I am always angry.  It doesn't stop there before the thyroid issues (which controls your metabolism) I was told I had a microadenoma in my pituitary gland, if u dont already know that is a small tumor on my pituitary gland, which is located in my brain, good thing is it has never changed in size, but the pituitary gland tells your thyroid(which I don't have) to do it's part, like to get your metabolism going, I take synthetic thyroid hormones, but it doesn't really help, so after working 40+hours a week I am so exhausted, but he doesn't understand, he thinks I am just being lazy and FAT, it doesnt stop there, my adrenal glands are also not functioning as they should so I have low cortisol, how do u fix that they prescribe u hydrocortisone, which is a steroid and everyone knows that makes u gain even more weight so I refuse to take it, which in turns causes severe joint pain and after a long day at work I get out of the car looking and feeling like I am 80, his words exactly.  I don't want to go to bed at 3pm when I get home, but I am so tired and in pain that i just dont want to do anything, i rarely leave the house bcse I hate the way I look, nothing fits and I know he does not want to be seen with me.  What happened for better or for worse.  Don't think all I do is complain, but when your body is working against itself and nobody understands and u feel all alone, I just dont know what to do.  I have to get this weight off bcse it is cause a HUGE strain on my body, causing me extreme anxiety and medically I am afraid I am going to have a heart attack.  I hope u see this or someone in your circle does, bcse I would love to know what u did, to get back in shape, I need this for me, physically, mentally, emotionally and medically, as well to get my life back.  Thank you for listening, even if u dont see this.  Jennifer jmlakos@gmail",0.1985,643

"This video is about Demi saying before she could be ready for a relationship, she needs to love herself. Love isn't something that completes you (or at least it shouldn't be). That's too much to ask of another person. There's no one in this world who you 'need' but yourself and your own love. Love doesn't fill a missing piece, it adds pieces to help you grow. And if you find that you are depending too much on someone or you feel incompetent when you don't have them by your side, you need to give yourself some space.",0.9622,111
