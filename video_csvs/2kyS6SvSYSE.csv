"Bloody brilliant idea about the podcast therapy.  If you ever need advise from some one who lives in Australia, and who also has 36 years of marriage experience under her belt, going on to 37. Let me know. 
P.S . The marriage has been a hell of a ride, with twist and turns I never dreamed could or would happen to me. 
Trust me my family life was nothing like the Brady bunch, more like .........OK can't compare with any television show I might have seen, but then again I'm not exactly up to date with television shows or movies, life was to busy and intense to have time to sit through a show or movie. But you I just found, and I like to watch, go figure! Must admit only seen a few of your shows so far, but I'm impressed so shall keep watching . Oh by the way recently saw one with the amazing Francine, what a trooper and smart as a tack, let her speak, she has a lot to say, love kids always make me smile.",0.9716,204

"I fear there is something profound being missed by a lot of ppl here.  In the new world, the talent is no longer about representing a mirror of reality - anybody can film in 4k, now.  Real art was never about the mirror, it was always about the content.  Now, the talent is in the creation of content, too.  You no longer get a pass as an artist because you are technically savvy about silver nitrate.  This artist reveals that truth, and, she also makes it ok to doodle on expensive things.  And Casey, your pivotal moment had not so much to do with you crashing into a police car, but much more about your skill as a film maker and an artist ... IMO, anyway.",0.1779,143

"The stuff shirt elitist culture of people who pretend they have some deep insight that validates AWFUL ""art"" that isn't art and anyone could replicate by either accident or having no skill needs to be obliterated. No you're not an artist just because mentally ill people throw money at you for God only knows, because you drew squiggles. It was not crafted from a deep mind, its not symbolic of a deep message, it is garbage masquerading as someones failed intellect. Oh yeah these round swirls in red really speak to me, it took 4 seconds to paint...It's the artistic equivalent of me trying out a new brush in photoshop before I immediately undo it to begin ACTUALLY painting art. It takes skill, it takes practice, it takes knowledge of form, function, lighting, it's NOT complete drivel with the excuse that art is whatever you decide it is. Renaissance painters and sculptors are artists, THIS SHIT is not art and it is precisely the drivel that is rotting our society.",-0.9448,190
