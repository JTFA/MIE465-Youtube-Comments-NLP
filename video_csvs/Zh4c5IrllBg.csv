"AAAAACCTTUUUAAALLLYYYY The public never GOT to go to Jurassic Park. The entire first movie was Dr. Hammond showing a bunch of scientists the park in a preview run in hopes they would sign off on it. The entire thing went to shit before the public even knew the park existed. Sure, one could argue that the T-Rex attack on San Francisco in The Lost World would make people think dinos are unsafe, but knowing InGen, I bet they covered that up to the rest of the world. Jurassic World was the first actual park open to the public and at the beginning of the movie they said that they had been operating there safely for years.

The image of a precious dove
Dancing barefoot on the beach
Drinking in love and sunshine
full of smiles

Mere child 
Dreaming awhile on a school title 
Learning to carry books for miles.

Carrying so many burdens

Not able To catch the spies and Spiders. 
Go back to the skies,

who tamed this land 
Until you are a spirit so good and pure
That you will truly guide

Bloodied hands.

Temptations of Evil 
Muscles of Clay,
Eyes of pitifully empty bliss,
Teeth of dragons never begotten, 
You stand alone 
Praying to brainless demons
Praising power empty Of Spirit,

You shall reap no Glory
But only Mortal death
