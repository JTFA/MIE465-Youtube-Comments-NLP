IDK if that's the perfect word lol and I personally still think he's cute and like him just as much as a ""dork"" but my point is that he's definitely not like a ""bro"" ladies-man like Steve lol or like wouldn't be a Mr. Popular type in an American HS anyway hahaha especially not in the 80s. He's not like a cocky, look at me kind of guy like Steve (or at least how Steve tries to come off). Obviously he's an artsy actor type of person IRL so that makes sense hahaha. So yeah, I'm just saying he's a great actor.
It really always amazes me how you don't even realize how great their acting is until you see them being themselves, if that makes sense. I remember the first time I realized that fully was when I was a kid and saw Matt LeBlanc (who played Joey on Friends) on a TV interview for the first time, and he was SOOO shy and quiet and I was like ""WHOA ACTING IS REAL"" hahahaha bc obviously ""Joey"" is a goofy, loud, ladies-man type of character - the total opposite. Anyway, obviously I understand the concept now, but it still always amazes me when you see someones real personality AFTER you've gotten used to their character. This isn't the first time I've seen Joe Keery, but whenever I do I always think of that, because he really changed everything about himself playing Steve, down to the smallest gestures, walk, way of carrying himself, accent, annunciation of words, etc. etc. etc. and really created a new person (which is always the GOAL of actors, but doesn't always happen hahaha). He's actually a great actor, and seems like a really intelligent, kind guy. I'm a fan :D",0.9985,376

The charactors were underdeveloped, the monsters completely changed over the episodes (it was almost human looking and walking upright at first, but then they became dogs basically), there were many subplots that went nowhere, and fucking wanona rider SUCKED!!! with her retarded facial expressions all the time. I went off on my freind for wasting my time like that. And on top of it, the show basically stole shit from ET and Goonies and mashed them together. And of course because its liberal hollywood, they HAD to inject racism in there with that teenage bad boy not wanting his little sister to play with the black kid.
