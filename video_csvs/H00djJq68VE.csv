"A little background from a MIlanese who grew up eating panettone and veneziana (an even more traditionally milanese Christmas cake with only candied orange peel and topped with an almond streusel). First, your delicious bread lacked the distinctive orange flavoring. The true traditional panettone (I am not saying that I dislike untraditional ones!) has a distinctive orange flavor that you can either get out of a bottle or make yourself (Italian link, chime in for translation: http://www.scattigolosi.com/2014/02/confit-dorange-modo-mio.html/). Second, Very traditionally leftover panettone was saved until February 11, then brought to the churches to be blessed and eated as a remedy against sore throat and dyptheria. Nowadays we have dyphteria shots that prevent it from killing children in scores (as happened to three of my granny's friends in the 1930's), so panettone is just sliced, toasted until crispy and enjoyed like that. Finally, actor Ugo Tognazzi was also a foodie and in an interview in the 1980's dictated this recipe to use up leftover panettone. The slices should be cleaned of the crust, which is sometimes a bit bitter, layered in a deep dish, doused liberally with cognac or rhum, then topped with loads of boozy zabaione. This used to be one of my favorite winter desserts with I was a child, and this fact does not explain why I turned out a reluctant teetotaller as an adult (alchool makes me sick).",0.943,267

I just decided to post it on your most recent video which is this one? :-) You know how you did a video with us on different salts (kosher vs. regular, etc.), maybe you could do a ""wine"" video like that, and just talk to us about the different wines and their tastes, etc.?
