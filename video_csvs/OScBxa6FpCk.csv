"A true inspiration. Thank you for being brave enough to show you having a seizure. Really helps people who have seizures not to feel embarrassed about it.

"It's so nice to see another epileptic athlete, and NOT MAKING EXCUSES! Good on you, girl. Go for gold at the highest level if you want to. I'm 32 years old, have had uncontrolled epilepsy since I was 4 years old, yet against the best able-bodied athletes in the world (many on performance-enhancing drugs) I became a world class athlete in the toughest sport on the planet: cross-country ski racing. Having seizures racing set me back for sure, but it makes us resilient and determined to prove we're as good as the others who don't suffer from these things. I also became an unbeatable rider on the horse show circuit and won prestigious showjumping competitions whilst actually having seizures. Because of the resilience I have I'm trying to become a Global Ambassador for Epilepsy (and another life-long condition), so would appreciate any peer support I can get from everyone, and Katie Cooke, you're the sort of kid who could back up my plight as a no-excuses,tough-as-boots-epileptic athlete I'd be honoured to have on my side. My channel doesn't have much yet, but I've made a start so would appreciate any support I can get for my plight. Also, anyone who reads this: please help my plight - my channel is BestHorseInTheStable

So my parents decided to quit getting her the medicines and seeing the doctor they had had, and changed a hospital and a doctor. Fortunately, the decision tuned out right, she started to cure, and it'd obviously become less to pass out during the day. At the same time as the decision they made, my parents started to change the foods she'd consumed to healthier ones such as beans and dairy foods, they says it might have an effect on her recovery as well.",0.3919,139
