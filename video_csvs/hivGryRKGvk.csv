"*2 cents from a random internet asshole* That front halo is WAY too far back. Like 6 inches. In almost any car you're more likely to hit your head on the front halo than the main hoop for two reasons: Your seat keeps you from going very far back in most cases, although your neck/spine is likely to stretch and go up... and the bend at the top of the front down tubes/uprights/A-pillar tubes can potentially (and likely in a bad enough crash) straighten out and get pushed down and back, pushing the front of the halo that much closer to the drivers head attached to their stretched out neck. Who gives a fuck what I think, but I would have done it very different, having stacked up my own collection of head injuries.",-0.3291,154
