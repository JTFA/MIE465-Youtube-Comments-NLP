"""This song finds Zedd working again with production collaborators, the electronic duo Grey, (brothers Kyle and Michael Trewartha). The trio previously teamed up on the Hailee Steinfeld-featuring 'Starving.' The track also marks the Russian-German producer's first time in the studio with country singer Maren Morris. Zedd said: 'It was super fun working with Maren because she is clearly an amazing singer and very talented musician. And, I always love working with Grey because we push ourselves to make the best music possible and the end result is incredible.'""
""The song was debuted on TV by all four artists during the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, on January 28, 2018. The spot, a Target ad that celebrates Grammy's history of unexpected musical moments which blend various genres, was directed by Dave Meyers and described as a 'visually spectacular commercial.' Zedd and Morris were both Grammy nominees at the ceremony. 'The Middle' is also central to Target's 2018 spring style advertising campaign, which kicked off a week later.""
""Zedd explained during a behind-the-scenes video that he and Grey had been working on the track for a while before they hooked up with Morris. '""The Middle"" has been a song we have been working on for a really long time,' he said. 'I started with Grey and we've been looking for the right singer. It's a really wide range, and you need a lot of energy and at the same time on the bridge you need to be really fragile and really believable.'""
""Maren Morris told ABC Radio that 'The Middle' was not only a different song for her genre-wise, but it also challenged her vocally. 'They were just having a hard time landing on the right voice and they wanted someone really soulful, but could also hit all the notes,' she explained. 'So it landed on me and they reached out and I heard it and initially I was like, ""Wow, I'm not used to singing this high up. But I will tackle it!""'""
""Zedd and Grey recorded over a dozen vocalists for 'The Middle' before they hit on Maren Morris. 'I don't remember the exact number, but I'm pretty sure we're at 14 different singers,' Zedd recalled to Billboard. 'And they range everywhere from somebody who uploaded a YouTube video of them singing to A-list superstars.' 'Some of them just sang it well,' he continued. 'Some of them are incredible singers, but it almost felt like they've never heard the song before, they're just reading it off a piece of paper, but they're singing it really well.' 'And then when Maren sings… really, to me personally, the song is a constant build-up,' Zedd added. 'It just gets more and more exciting. And the bridge, which is oftentimes a kind of boring moment in a song, is my personal favorite moment. It's where she's so vulnerable. Just her and a small guitar, and you really every breath, and you hear every squeak and everything. I just think that she carried it the best.'""",0.9885,606

"[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Ohh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Baby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle
