I am sure Ed is a nice guy and well meaning politically and  anne-marrie a good singer but this is an empty echo of the original. despite its offensive lyrics the original i a classic and had meaning because of the evident emotion of the singers. They had stories to draw on...I can barely imagine Ed being a bit oissed much less being in a drunk tank. Anne Marie do not give the impression of someone who has been truly heartbroken. Both of them should stick to jingle bells....ps posted in goodwill.,0.633,101

"They need more presence with each other to really make a good performance of this track. I thought Ed Sheeran had better initiative. They are singing their own parts here. They need to create a symmetry of musical give and take between them, and really treat this as a duet ballad, not a double solo. It's a heartwrenching song about the destitution, addiction and dreams not quite reached. It should be frustratingly emotional, yet this performance seems to just throw all of that to the wind. I was so excited when I clicked on this, I really do hope that they see come by and scroll past this comment and see as constructive criticism. They have wonderful voices, it could be so special if they worked together, not alone then performing just on the same track.",0.9694,151
