"First off where surfer ate it wasn't very big, maybe triple over head max.  Secondly the first ski operator blew it, lost his line, and flipped on his way in.  Starting to wonder about those ski guys at Nazare just check out Cotton wipeout when a ski guy ""rescued"" Cotton and had a brain freeze by turning around and trying to go back out to sea.  He flipped, and all he had to do was go straight to the beach.  But ski guy in green did his job, rescued surfer and told him to jump early so he could go back and get ski operator.  Most these ski cowboys, who pretend to be watermen, don't even wear helmets.  And ever surfer, if they didn't have waterlogged brains, would be wearing helmets and in bright flourescent suits. Real surfing has no tow in and no jet ski.  This isn't real surfing it's tow in which is REALLY easy, but the wipeout usually are not.",0.424,184

So many surf videos are too tight (maybe for making the waves appear more imposing), and those make it hard to get a sense of the landscape.

"I’ve always worked out and trained even for smaller waves. Most people think training is unnecessary. Well, maybe so. However, when the waves are this large, it’s almost a death wish if you fail to train for it. A hold down even for 15 seconds on a wave of this magnitude can just about kill you and has killed people. When your body is tweaked in ways you can’t imagine and you’re twenty feet below the surface...it takes everything you have to survive that. Dealing with cold water and a wetsuit make it that much harder. Just the mental confidence of training can mean the difference between life and death. Even your diet is a huge factor. Your Cardio better be on point. This level of surfing is just nuts. It’s not just falling on one wave that kills people. It’s the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. I’d seriously pray to God before paddling out there. Anything that can go wrong, usually will.",-0.9398,199
