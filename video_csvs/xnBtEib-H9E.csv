Everyone needs to stop commenting on how cheap it is to live everywhere else, WE GET IT. Whichever city people choose to live, it's their choice! We are well aware that NYC is obviously one of the most expensive place on earth! It's natural that a big city like NYC would have higher costs of living. Every other big cities in the world is JUST THE SAME, San Fran, Paris, London..etc. I live in Toronto, and I pay close to $3K for my mortgage of a small townhome. My friends pay $1.6K for a small studio downtown. ALSO When you live in a big city, you also naturally get to be paid more. Everything is relative.

"They live in Brooklyn not NYC. You get more room for your money outside of NYC if you're a gentrifier with an income or have a pretty decent start to living in NY. Us natives can remember a time when this couple wouldn't be caught dead in parts of Brooklyn past sunset and rents for space like this was well under $1000. Manhattan was once affordable before a few mayors pimped out NYC to the highest bidders. Taxes were very reasonable and the price of living comfortably wasn't just a dream but  attainable. Thanks to an influx of people moving in from other states things have shifted drastically and the concept of NY living is no longer what it used to be or a detectable derivative. It's become unrecognisable and mislabeled and very foreign, angry and snobbish because of outsiders coming in thinking that's how NYrs are (they see it in a movie it must be true many of them thought) and what's even more sad, blurred lines of neighborhoods. Prime example, this video. It's labeled what you can get in NYC. Technically it's what you can get in BK. No New Yorker would ever consider BK NYC and the only time there outer boroughs are thought of as the city (Manhattan to those within the 5) is if you live further out up in NYS (think Elmira or Lake George, Utica and Ithaca) ANYWAY...I may be  pontificating, but truly I'm passionate about my state and city and love to inform/ share with anyone who's wanting to come or live here while I learn what NY looks like to them.  ❤",0.9558,297

Yes we can all move to the boonies and have a mansion for $1000/month, but some people don't want to have to drive an hour for good food, culture and things that cities offer. Or maybe they just want to take public transport and not have to drive a 1.5 hr (cough SoCal) commute to work.

"Two can play the anecdote game: I've known several people who have left Dallas and say they wouldn't go back for anything. 

You really can't imagine that there are people in this world that want different things out of life than you want? How terribly sad and narrow-minded of you. There are people who look at what you call ""slow and easy"" and see ""dull and boring."" There are pros and cons to living anywhere and people choose one over the other for different reasons, and that's okay.

I like living in a major metropolitan area  because I can make six figures working in an industry that I love instead of answering phones at an insurance company, which is what my high school classmates back home do if they didn't go to nursing school. I don't need a 3000 sq ft home, because I can barely fill my (affordable) 800 sq ft 2BR apartment, which, by the way, is in a clean, quiet neighborhood a 5-minute walk from a large park. I like not needing a car. I like having other people take care of my home repairs, not paying property taxes, and not worrying about raking leaves or mowing grass. I like being able to hop on the train and get Nepalese food at midnight if I feel like it. I like being able to go to events at museums and art galleries. I like how easy it is to go to the theater or concerts or book signings. I like how easy it is to walk to the train and be able to go to other cities on the East Coast in a few hours. You don't have to pay a lot of money for watered-down cocktails if you're not a tourist, because you know where to go to get a $5 beer in an underground bar. 

It doesn't matter if you don't like it. You can spend your entire life watching videos about people who live in other cities and complaining about them if that's what makes you happy. Different strokes for different folks, right?",0.9893,386

"Well, I guess you have to live here to understand why people from around the world want to live and work in New York City. There's a reason why people write songs, movies, books, poems, and set TV shows here. There's a reason why NYC continues to be one of the greatest symbol of the United States with the Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Center. It's also one of the oldest cities in the country founded in 1624. It's true, New York City isn't for everyone.",0.9393,99

"Y'all tripping.. All these transplants increased the rent in NYC through pure demand. This was at most $800-900 in the 90's.  Now its super unreasonable to pay so much money to not own but rent your living space. If only they gave the tenants of the ""past"" insight that the places they rest isnt secure and that they will be thwarted by this belief in perversed capitalism.

Now they are forced out without a socially conscious transition plan. I've seen families challenged by the alarming prices of rent.  

No shade to anyone able to afford these things. Just wish we had community conscious commerce that at least would help existing communities flourish rather than see them as temporary footstolls to a profitable future. Selfish.  Such is ""this way"" of life.  

Lesson: Own where your rest.  Invest in your communal family. Have peace of mind.",0.5017,166
"Yes, New York is expensive...I'm not sure what's so shocking about that to you all. On the other hand, the average wages are higher, you don't have to pay for a car, and there are a lot of perks.

I personally enjoy living in a smaller city right now, because I get the same amount of space as they do for a fourth of the price (or a third if their utilities are included) but if I could afford to live in a bigger city without sweating the cost, I'd love it, too.",0.8598,107

mcjecca I couldn't disagree more. The large cities all across America including new York are losing residents to the South and Midwest. I've spoken to several people who have left new York and they said they wouldn't go back for anything. You get twice the house and twice the land in the southern U.S. and they also say life is slower and easier. In those big cities You usually have more concentrated poverty and much more crime. Also in general large cities are filthy. Too many people in too small a place and all of them with different hygienes. I'm not keen on paying out the ass to live in a closet either.,-0.8909,124
