A friend of mine asked me to help him rescue a pitbull that was an injured stray like this beautiful guy. It took us awhile to get him (a big Mac finally did the trick lol) because he was so afraid of people. I just fell in love with him so after the vet visit I decided to keep him. He is a happy healthy boy who loves everybody. You are all fantastic people for the work you do and a thank you isn't nearly enough to show how appreciated you are. Keep up the great work and bless you all!!!,0.9927,111
