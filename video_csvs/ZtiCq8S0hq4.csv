Always talk negative about Floyd Mayweather but reality is if it wasn't for Floyd Mayweather he wouldn't have the money he have now so he should be thanking Floyd Mayweather for putting him in a position that he's in and the way he's living so yes!

That bodyguards looks like he's having a really bad day or just really serious about his Ice Cube face :)) 
Floyd in the UFC!? That's close to impossible, Floyd is not about being the best fighter, that is not what Floyd's era is about. Floyd is all about business, all about the benjamins, picking the highest paying fights and most importantly picking the most conveniant and favorable opponents. The era of honor in the ring is a thing of the past that will stay in the past with greats like Tyson, Ali, Marciano, Dempsey, Sugar Ray etc. Those guys fought anyone coming their way, those guys fought the best in their best condition and didn't pick their fights for the money but rather for the honor and glory with money as a bonus. Floyd and his carreer are the opposite of that, not to take away from his excellent athleticism and deffensive skills, mind you.
Because of that it is highly unlikely for Floyd to make any serious and honest effort to enter the UFC or even flirt with that.",0.9896,218
