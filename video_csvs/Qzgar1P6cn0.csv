"I like it. My cats would think it was designed for them to sit on, not for silly hoomans to climb up and down.
We have a similar design in metal at work. To get to the loading dock level from ground level and still be able to pass  to the man-door outside, it could not be normal stairs, so they had to go with that, and OSHA considers it a ladder, so we have to suffer special ladder training every year because of it. My Manager freaks because I can run the rails on the back of my arms and go down it facing out. The hand rails are slightly wider than my torso, and narrower than my shoulders, and just the right angle for this. This is considered ""unsafe"" for a ""ladder"" as per OSHA, but with my arthritis it is safer than trying to do it ""correctly"".",0.7107,171

When I had a loft bed I made a set of steps in the same way, screwed and then replaced with dowels.  I had wooden hooks on the top so it could be removed or moved to a different part of the bed frame.

"Most of the forces seen are vertically down, and that's all on the dado/groove. None of that gets transferred to the dowel. If the stairs were not right against a wall, the dowels would then see some possible racking forces. Even so, the 6 thick steps in grooves (and the 24 dowels holding them in) should stand up to it.
