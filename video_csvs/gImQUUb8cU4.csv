"1st — I’m the same age as Hedy and I agree with what dodie is saying about the School thing, schools really don’t treat anxiety and stuff with a severity that should be needed. 
2nd— I don’t know what to think about self diagnosing because I am scared to do it myself but I also don’t want to talk to my parents about it but I would like to get properly diagnosed 
3rd— social media is totally two sides of the same coin there, sometimes it makes me feel better to distract myself with the pictures and stories of others but then again it will sometimes trigger anxiety as well
4th— YouTube and online influencers have totally made anxiety such a better thing to talk about and I don’t feel nervous when I talk about it in school or with my friends because I am assured that it is a normal thing 
5th—It’s totally a better thing to call than text when you are having bad anxiety, it is so easy to get off topic and distracted when you call and it always makes you feel better!
   —I am really glad to have this online safe space to talk about things like these because it’s so much easier to be open about it here—❤️❤️",0.9871,244

"About social media making it better or worse: I'd say it can easily go either way, or even be both at once. So like for example, looking at my classmates FB profiles definitely made me more depressed. But on the other hand, I would never, ever, ever had realized (or even considered) that I had depression (much less gone in for diagnosis or treatment) if I hadn't read other people talking about their experiences with it on Tumblr.

"For me, as a personal experience, social media has helped me. A lot.

Not for mental health reasons, but finding my sexuality.

I'm a teen, and I don't think that there have really been any negative impacts about sexuality from social media.

However, sometimes social media encourages me to overthink things too much, and I start labelling myself too much and getting too confused and everything gets so pointlessly complicated and it makes me feel stupid and-

I started to think I had anxiety.

And ocd.

And that I was pan (I now label myself as bi).

I have no problem with pansexuality, I just started over thinking it and it's just not me.

But I believe that, as you said, social media has its ups and downs. It's pros and cons. It's good sides and it's bad sides.

You just need to try and find your balance.

"From an angsty, awkward, anxiety ridden teen, I think that the way that a lot of schools and workplaces handle a lot of things really weirdly, and often very wrong. 

Plus, there’s a huge stigma around mental illness, and many (not all, obviously) people without any mental health problem don’t seem to get it as well as perhaps the people with the illness would like them too, mainly I think because it’s not talked about enough in schools.

"I find mental health, in particular anxiety, is often more chronic in adults as oppose to acute as in teens. 

Tackling mental health during a child/ young adult's life is critical to healthy development into adulthood. 

From experience it is easier to express and discuss your mental health with practitioners, friends and family, however, there is a complete disconnect with that and the workplace. Suffering from mental illness in silence at work is almost encouraged by professionals (docs, managers, etc.), where as the opposite is true for teens at school. The stigma can hault your career development and progression in the workplace due to societal and individuals' prejudice and discrimination. 
Also, as an adult, paying bills is number one priority whether for your own living or that of your family too, which is why I'd say mental health issues in adults is mire long term. 
An adult sufferer literally can not afford to focus on recovery and miss work for appointment or even take medication that could affect their performance at work; plus, being signed off my a doctor is usually too short term for any real benefits to be felt. This is where adults are pushed to breaking point, where coping is no longer an sustainable option and as a result risk losing their job's, home's and connections with family and friends. 

The need for mental health to be addressed and treated, accordingly, in both teens and adults is of equally high importance, but the methods must sometimes depending on the individual's life commitments and personal needs.",0.1289,290

I have self diagnosed myself simply because it's so so obvious and clear to me that this is a problem with my mental well being. I have researched it thoroughly countless times to check and double check, I've taken hundreds Of tests, I've done tests at school and the results are always the same ""severe anxiety"" ""severe depression"" and I just wish someone would help me. all I want at this point In my life is for someone just to squeeze my hand and say ""it's okay, you'll be okay, I believe in you, and I am always here for you"" . anyways that's just a little bit of an insight coming from a teen.

It runs in my family and my mom suffered from it when she was my age and later from derealisation so that made me feel more reassured about self-diagnosing. Especially because I live in Zurich, a psychologist would cost so much money and would take quite a long time. Also the official word for anxiety in german is the word that people use when they're scared (and that is so not what it is) so the only word I have to describe it to my friends is anxiety, but again, I can't translate that word and its just stupid.

At the same time, professional diagnosis is even scarier, because it means there really is something wrong with me, and it’s very expensive. My ‘panic/anxiety attacks’ (i add quotation marks because 1; im not sure and 2; it was originally called that by someone else, which encouraged me to research anxiety) are less of the crying shaking running out of the room stereotype and more of my head on the desk, heavy breathing, overthinking and really painful silence.

"Tbh I don’t think it’s fine to post things about mental health that are ‘relatable’ because it can make people think it’s normal and okay to feel a certain way when it’s absolutely not which can make them accept that they’re in a bad situation and not do anything about it, it should be talked about but don’t talk about it so people can be like ‘omg relatable!!’",0.6988,87

"The only thing to me about self diagnosing is that I have been officially diagnosed with both anxiety and ADHD, and those are both disorders that SO MANY PEOPLE self diagnose them self with at my age. It really can invalidate these things that deeply affect my everyday life when I tell adults about them.",-0.1779,58
"The relationship dynamic between everyone seems a little more tense but that is probably the anxiety that's pouring out of all of them. Dodie in the beginning is very reserved and her body is pulled back but as they talk she comes out in both ways. She is more vocal and this created a difference in Evan. In the beginning he is extremely vocal and present and once Dodie and him have a small disagreement with medication and therapy, then he shuts down and withdrawals. It's fascinating to see their anxiety play a hand even in a conversation like this.",0.9188,106
"The thing about self diagnosing is a that you have kids at my school diagnosing themselves then calling being upset/mad at a friend  panic attacks. 
I'm very aware that those things can trigger panic attacks however 1. I'm talking about my school specifically
2.I'm talking about the smallest argument or even worse, something to get attention.  For example there was one girl who would use anything to get this boys attention(she'd message him about panic attacks, act like friends were bullying her(she did this to me when I was off school for a week without any form of contact) and probably the most triggering one lie about self harming/depressoin (she said that biting the skin around her thumbs was her way of self harm)) I know anxiety, depression ECT are different in everyone and self diagnosing works (to a certain extent) however I believe if someone is going to parade around about anxiety(I mean almost brag about it not just talk about it) they should atleast show more symptoms. No hate to anyone who hasn't been diagnosed(I haven't ). You're beautiful. You're loved. You're perfect. 
Ps please dont leave hate. My aim of this post wasn't to start an argument however I'd love to discuss you opinions :)",-0.9657,241
Things that drive me nuts is that people say “she doesn’t look like she has anxiety” or depression or any other type of mental health problems. What does mental health look like?????????? It’s sadly not something tangible that somebody can just through away. Ughhhhhhh,-0.8738,55
"This helped me so much. I have anxiety and depression but I'm only 14,  and no takes me seriously and acts like their life is harder (without knowing my life) and even if it is, that doesn't mean it doesn't effect me. It has a lot to do with my past, I had no friends very early on and it was awful, i now have bad trust issues and it effects me a lot. My closest friend that knew everything about me and was like my sister died and I don't feel comfortable talking about my anxiety with any of my friends. Sorry, just needed to get this out.",-0.721,121

"This was really insightful and relatable. I feel like as an adult with anxiety, other adults don't really take me seriously when I say I have it. I know my family doesn't, which isn't at all helpful. Also the first thing my doctor did when I mentioned having anxiety was prescribe me medicine. I mean...there was no discussion about therapy besides him giving me a card to ring a number. I was really surprised he gave me pills so quickly, and I've yet to feel any benefits from them, but my dosage just got increased so maybe I will soon enough.",0.4937,113

You say it's easy in the uk but when I went to the doctors they didn't really believe me and just chucked me in group therapy so I don't even know if I'm properly diagnosed but they gave me 'treatment' I guess it was very unclear and I'm too 'awkward' to ask questions,-0.2475,57

"i have a question: as a teen, i asked my psychologist if i could have generalized anxiety, and she said i couldn't since that can only be diagnosed once you are an adult. however, she said it was clear that i did have severe anxiety. so is there really a difference between teens and adults when it comes to anxiety? what's the difference between being diagnosed with generalized anxiety and just having anxiety?",-0.7059,81
"i haven't been diagnosed with anxiety yet because my family doesn't have enough money for therapy or anything but my dad has been diagnosed and he feels the same i do. i will say i do believe i have anxiety. i've had several attacks (mostly bc i over think coming out as pan and agender to my trans and homophobic parents yIKES) my parents think it's just teenage hormones because i am fourteen, but i don't believe it is because i've felt it anxiety my entire life. i also believe i have derealization and dissociation which doesn't mix very well, so it's just a whole mix of the feeling of needing to selfharm and pick at my skin. i will most /definitely/ not self-diagnose bc a) if i do it could start a bunch of crap with people who have beeb diagnosed and b) i don't know if my parents are correct about the hormones. also i'd like to comment on what evan said ""i've been bullied by my brother all my life"" i know /exactly/ how you feel because my little sister is toxic. being bullied by your family hurts but i am very very proud of you for holding on because it's not easy. this has turned into a rant oops okay goodbye now",-0.9765,235

"i’m in the middle of all your ages but i mostly agree with evan’s comments from experience, especially regarding social media and cyber bullying. also, i DEFINITELY find self diagnosis problematic. even if you can’t afford a psychiatric evaluation, and use coping mechanisms you find online, you still can’t say you know what you have unless you’ve studied psychology in uni yourself. i agree with jessie that you don’t need a diagnosis to get therapy and benefit from it; in fact i always say EVERYONE should go to therapy because it’s an educated and unbiased perspective. i would say in my experience people actually take adults with anxiety less seriously than teens, because when you get older people have a ‘just get over it’ attitude, and because people have started to recognize that social media is harmful but forget that younger adults grew up with it too and were influenced by it.",0.1996,180

"this is ridiculous, 'we cant say we have it at work' your job is youtube and its ALL they talk about.

also, im really uncertain on how this topic has been discussed. self diagnosing is really really bad in my opinion. because SO many young people are online and going through puberty I think so many believe they have anxiety when in actuality they are stressed, uncomfortable or going through a bad time (which is just as serious as having anxiety). its social media that has made 'diagnosing and naming' a mental illness paramount to it being taken seriously. this ends up with so many people diagnosing themselves because they want attention and support (also not necessarily a bad thing) but with this, takes away from people who have genuine anxiety as a medical condition. remember that being stressed for a few months is NOT the same as having a genuine illness. youtubers glorify mental illness in some cases and i despise them for it as it means people see having anxiety as almost being popular to have. it means people who have anxiety cant just say they have it as it is not being taken as seriously !!

also, people forget that anxiety is a MEDICAL problem. you wouldnt use outwardly showing bad health such as vomitting or having measles as art form so why is anxiety viewed like this ?? people with actual mental health problems have enough trouble as it is being taken seriously, it is so so so harmful for people to believe bad health is good.",-0.9927,287
"throughout middle school, my French teacher would get angry and frustrated with me whenever I had anxiety attacks before/during my presentations. one time she sent me out into the hall and forgot to come and talk to me and I was outside for the whole class hour. So definitely, many teachers don't take anxiety seriously. my social studies teacher understood but she was the only one who was nice about it where it was relevant (presentations only happened in French and Social). I would always get comments from every class in my report cards too about how I need to participate more lol but raising my hand alone is a lot",0.7842,121
