"Hey man, so I just wanted to say that I'm a long-time fan, and I appreciate all the content you put out on a regular basis (I honestly thought you were one of the most underrated channels on YouTube, so I'm glad to see you hit 1M) . 

I just tried to donate to your video here, but in order for me to be able to do that, you have to install this Chrome extension called Tipp and create an account.

If you want more information, just google ""Tipp Chrome extension"" and look at the website, but it basically just allows people like me, who want to give a bit more than a Like, to make a donation on your video. If you let your audience know they should download it, too, then they'll be able to start giving out donations where they see fit (as well as being able to receive donations themselves on their own channels). 

I'd appreciate it if you'd try it out, but if not, keep up the great work anyways man.",0.9875,199

All eggs should cost around $6.99 each (mayo chickens are hard to keep, they lounge around all day and don't pay rent). Watch out because some farmers can scam you, I recently bought a dozen mayo eggs from my local farmer and I paid around $120 for the lot without knowing how much they are really worth.",-0.3841,132
