I like Suicide squad, since i saw it, i made sense why Batman is not a villain in BvS and why Deadshot cannot be anything but a villain. Wonder woman is not that great, but has really good plot and nice historical points to make. The whole DCEU is like a really expensive 4-stories prequel to Justice League, which I like and is kinda ballsy thing to do.",0.9612,92

But I agree Steppenwolf is so much CGI.That airport scene in Civil war is documentary-like if you compare the scenes. I saw mustaches only in the first scene. Never again.
