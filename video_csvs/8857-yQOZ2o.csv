Awesome the Bugatti Chiron came out in Forza Motorsport 7 I never knew that I think they would do it in Japan Forza Horizon 4 in Forza Horizon 4 when it came out I think the Koenigsegg Agera RS what came out then the Hennessey Venom F5 will come out in Forza Horizon 4 that Hennessey can go 300 miles an hour will be epic if Forza Motorsport 7 came out with a Koenigsegg RS and the Hennessey Venom F5 but if it doesn't came out then got to wait for Forza Horizon 4 in Japan Tokyo I think,0.3716,99

"Excellent job @turn10studios for making this car pack spontaneous enough to sit among the rest. You guys are doing amazing at HQ. If I may, I would like to make two suggestions:

1) You included the SRT Durango. This SUV could use some more competition along with the other SUVs within the game. May I suggest adding the Chevy SSR, Infiniti FX35/QX70, Lexus RX350 F Sport, Chevy TrailBlazer SS, or Ford Explorer SPORT?

2) You included the KIA Stinger. This car could also use some stiffer competition. May I suggest adding the recent Ford Taurus SHO, Lexus GS F/LS F, Infinit Q80 S, Buick Regal GS, Pontiac Bonneville GXP (any GXP model honestly), SAAB 9-5 Turbo, Acura TL SH-AWD, Genesis G80 Sport, or even the recent Toyota Camry XSE V6?

Hopefully these cars can deliver versatility and perhaps allow your studios to be the first to ever include some of these vehicles in a game format? Take a moment to hear me out. The fans would love it.",0.9247,201

"PSA to those wanting the 812 Superfast, 675LT, 720S, Hurac√°n LP 640-4 Performante, F90 M5, etc.

1. The 812 Superfast and Hurac√°n Performante are in Assetto Corsa. WARNING: Assetto Corsa is unplayable with a controller. It actually requires you to get a steering wheel for that game.

2. The 720S is still a Project CARS 2-exclusive car for the time being. With that, the McLaren car that is most likely to appear instead is the 675LT, which apparently has existed for 3 years without a console appearance (thanks a lot, CSR 2 and Asphalt 8). Also, the F90 M5 is still a Need for Speed Payback-exclusive car.

3. Always remember that it takes 6 months for Turn 10 Studios to get a new car added into the game. This includes the licensing agreements and sourcing, laser scanning, recording, and modeling the car. Cars like the Corvette ZR1 (C7), McLaren Senna, Devel Sixteen, Fenyr SuperSport, etc. can appear but not yet since they are not even six months old yet. By contrast, cars that do not have a scannable AND functional model in real life, such as the Mazda Furai, TRION NEMESIS, etc., cannot be added at all. In contrast to this, cars like the Lamborghini Egoista, Mazzanti Evantra, Rimac Concept_One, etc., while having scannable and functional models in real life, are the hardest to come across (the Lamborghini Museum security aren't too keen about anyone touching or getting too close to the Egoista). Race cars are also among one of the hardest to get in the game as they require more licensing agreements, particularly from the racing teams that sponsor these cars (e.g. McLaren GT for the 650S GT3, Risi Competizione for the 488 GT3/GTE).",0.8839,348
