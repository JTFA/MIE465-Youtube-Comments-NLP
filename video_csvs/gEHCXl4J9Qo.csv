"Blah blah same story as all other swifties. Started listening to her when i was 9, now im 19. Whatever. All that aside, I dont wanna be rude cause i can tell you genuinely like her and are a swiftie but you need to understand that shes grown up. She cant be exactly how she was at 15. Shes nearly 28! Do you think you would be the same? But if you listen carefully to reputation, you can still here parts of her past self. Like watch the behind the scenes. Her lyrics are the same, Even the style of the song when you see her with her guitar they've just been covered by pop instruments. But as fans we have to acknowledge that people change, they grow up and want to explore and diversify and thats okay.

"Lyrics
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but

Don‚Äôt read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you‚Äôre turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's going to be a long road
I'll be there through the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it‚Äôs wrong or we‚Äôre making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year‚Äôs Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Don‚Äôt read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

"okay, i know taylor will probably never read this, but i need to thank her for something. when i was in fourth grade, i picked up her album ""fearless"". i instantly fell in love. when i was in fourth grade, i was depressed, lonely, and struggling. listening to some of those songs over and over made me feel not so alone anymore. i got back into singing (i sang a long before) and started writing songs. in sixth grade, i had several hospitalizations due to suicide attempts and self-harm. i started listening to some of taylor's very old unreleased songs, and i fell in love again. i am diagnosed with asperger syndrome, depression, anxiety, and gender dysphoria (i'm transgender). i am now a junior in high school, and i'm slipping back into my depression. i just recently got a ukulele, and that and taylor's new album have honestly given me hope. i feel most at home writing songs with my ukulele. it's like i was meant to do this. i finally have the motivation to post my original songs on youtube, and i'm going to eventually audition for america's got talent. and i honestly have taylor swift to thank for helping me find my calling. so thank you, taylor. thank you for making music that inspires others. thank you for being so open and honest in your songs. thank you for helping me find my passion. thank you thank you thank you. i hope to one day thank you in person, but this will have to do for now.",0.9966,302
