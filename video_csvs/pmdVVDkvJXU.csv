"Actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of trying to have sex with him when he was 14.
Actor Roberto Cavazos claimed that he had several 'nasty' encounter with Spacey that bordered on sexual harassment.
Film-maker Tony Montana claimed that he was forcefully groped by Spacey?
Media Rights Capital, co-producer of House of Cards stated that a member of the crew had complained about Spacey and that Spacey had willingly participated in a training process.
The son of actor Richard Dreyfuss alleges that Kevin Spacey groped him when he was 18.
An investigation by the Old Vic Theatre concludes they have received 20 personal testimonies of alleged inappropriate behaviour by Spacey during his 11-year tenure as artistic director. Out of the 20 individual allegations, 16 have been made by former staff, all of whom are men.

So you are suggesting that these 25 men are lying? The actual total of men who are accusing Spacey is 30. So that would be 30 men who are lying if Spacey is innocent...",-0.9456,185

"I'm very happy to hear that you had that reaction. It's fantastic. But things are not always black and white.  You might have been well rounded, brave and confident enough in the first place to do what you did but not everyone is the same. Not everyone will want to risk their jobs, especially if they worked hard for it or if they don't think they are good at any other job.  It also depends on the situation. For you it might have been clear pretty quickly that you did nothing wrong because maybe the harrassement your suffered  might not have been severe enough to cause deep damage, or that you had done nothing sexual ( like wearing fitting clothes) to encourage this or even that you are sure of your sexuality if you are heterosexual...there are many reasons why you could have snapped out of it pretty quickly. But human beings are complicated and different personalities mixed with different experiences will make us all react differently to certain things. For those that say they were afraid to lose their jobs, some of them could also have been thinking that they were to blame in the first place for putting themselves in that situation. Take some of the women Weinstein harrassed. Many found themselves in his office or appartment for different circumstances ( created by HW) and could be thinking that it's their fault in the first place and that if they say something people will lose respect for them and they can lose their job and reputation. The thing with hollywood is that it is very exposed and losing a job there in shame can feel many times worst because you are in the plublic eye so much. Let's also take very poor people (like in Haiti for example) with very low paying jobs and who have mouths to feed and not that many more recourses or opportunities in terms of jobs. Most of the time these people can only swallow whatever abuse they get. Life is freaking complicated. One thing is for sure though bullies have always been around and something like that should be encouraged as it gives strength to more people to teach people to treat them fairly.",-0.7873,398

""Don't be so harsh on them"" when he tries to discipline the kids. The dads have to work harder. The women work, but they have the choice of staying home if and when possible.

Speaking of the Fanning sisters, Dakota has more chance to sit at this roundtable than Elle does. Dakota is on the same league with Saoirse in terms of acting but her only problem is that she always chooses to star in films that only turns out to be flops (I gasp at her poor choice of movies and why she did not fire her incompetent manager yet).

"Theclowcard I don't like to say that television awards are always fair or talking about them as if they always make the right choice in the acting categories.
The Academy sometimes makes wrong choices, we saw this in february when Emma Stone won over Isabelle Huppert and when  Amy Adams wasn't nominated.
But You also have prestigeous asociations like the critics trifecta, they make choices based on talent and they don't care about the fame or status of the actor or the movie in which they are.
Jennifer Lawrence was able to win this very selective trifecta in 2013 and 2014 and later she manages to win the most popular Award show, the Oscar. She never won the trifecta for only one movie, she won LAFCA for silver linings playbook and was runner up in the NSFCC, Next year she won NYFCC  and NSFCC for American Hustle, she won this selective Award in 2013 and months later the Oscar. My point Is that if You think the Oscar Is overrated then You can look on the other side and see that she Is a trifecta winner too, so You can't deny her talent and You can't say that Saorise Ronan Is better,  Because even in her best performance (Brooklyn) she wasn't capable to win the trifecta, she was very close if we remember that she was runner up in the NSFCC but Charlotte Rampling won over her.
On then other side Saorise Ronan won the NYFCC for Brooklyn but she doesn't won any of the other awards in television, Brie Larson was the winner of all of them.
Finishing this I want to say if she wins the trifecta Award at the age of 23 this year for lady bird she could surpass Jennifer and prove to people like me that she gave her best performance.

Julia Roberts won her Oscar at the age of 30. Elle Fanning is younger then Ronan, has a potential to seat at this roundtable one day, next to Saoirse maybe, who knows and someone will say exactly the same stupidity, cause you like to compare by age.

I heard this clishe - she always plays herself. I don't know where it came from, this might be said about any actress if you can't stand her.

"Zarar Afridi -- Saoirse Ronan definitely is not and should not be envious of Jennifer Lawrence. If you look at how Jennifer Lawrence has been talking about the Harvey Weinstein scandal, she's leaving a lot of things unsaid that make people wonder if she ever played the casting couch game with him or anyone else. There are also lots of stories about Jennifer being a drunk. Wouldn't be surprised if she ends up in rehab someday. So she's paying the price of fame, while Saoirse seems to be a level-headed, respected actress who doesn't have a ""famewhore"" reputation, and has luckily never been sexually harassed.  

Saoirse Ronan can honestly say she never slept with Harvey Weinstein to further her career. There are a lot of other actresses (some of them Oscar winners) who can't say the same thing. An Oscar can't buy self-respect if you've whored yourself out to get one.",0.8833,168

"ZombieKilla At the end of the day it's about choice. When a person is abused, their choice was stolen from them. They didn't CONSENT to have this action done to them.  The decision to come forward is their CHOICE not anyone else's.  If someone shames or forces him or her to come forward, they took away that person's choice which makes the shamer no better than the original abuser.  

The reason that this disgusting sexual behavior is so successful is because they make the victim feel like it is their fault and it is something that takes a years or a lifetime to sort through. 

These women don't want pity. They don't need your judgement.  They want the abusers held accountable and the harassment to stop.",-0.9652,137
"ZombieKilla I wasn't sexually harassed.  I was raped. The reason I didn't come forward was because I never wanted anyone's pity nor did I want to be labeled a victim. And the more I was pressured to speak, the more I retreated.  Everyone handles trauma differently. Some can jump out and go scorched earth like Rose McGowan and others feel that they cannot. It's a personal thing that one must deal with for themselves. and the guilt and pain can be overwhelming. 
Do I think something bad to Jennifer Lawrence? Yes, someone that young and beautiful near a scumbag like Harvey Weinstein?  I would be surprised if she got away unscathed.  Someday in the future when she Chooses, after she deals with the pain and trauma, she will seek the help she needs and help who she can help. And it will be none of the public's business.  She might be rich and famous now but she was in Weinstein's sphere when was a teenager.
In addition to that,  her personal photos were hacked,  and this was another messed up thing. 
The difference between every other business and Hollywood is the since it's inception women's bodies have been treated as a commodity in the media.  
Now, if you want to be judgemental  you can do what you want. But for many who don't come forward and speak to the media, it's because they may feel like they have to protect themselves.  
The best analogy I have is this: when you are in an airplane and the facemasks drop, you have to put yours on before you help someone else.  So, if she isn't ready to speak, then she, like many others don't have to until they are.",0.7844,320

I'm very glad you did (though I'm baffled that they didn't fire the guy). But when the industry we're talking about is Hollywood, things are very, very different. The victims are always impressionable young men and women who want to have a career, and these powerful men in charge have all means to shut them forever. The guilt and shame becomes so overwhelming that the thought of coming forward is unthinkable.",0.8342,141

matias balbin Then I‚Äôll gladly come back to this thread after that.,0.34,15
"matias balbin You see. What Jennifer Lawrence has more than than Saoirse Ronan is luck which is the forte for an actor‚Äôs career. In the movie industry, like any industry, the more connections you have, the more chance of getting ahead. There are many talented actresses but they are not fortunate enough to convince a director or casting agent. I only evaluate actresses after watching them in at least 5 movies and to be honest, Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs acting bored me already. Keep in mind that NOBODY knew who she was before 2010. Unlike Jennifer who debuted her acting carries at the age of 18, Saoirse has been working as an actress since she was 9 so of course she would have more acting experiences under her belt. And I base my criticism on the entire repertoire of an actress instead of just a few good movies. There are two types of acting method usually seen in actors: acting by instinct and technique (or both). Saoirse and Dakota excel in acting by their instincts but their techniques are also good whilst actresses like Jennifer and Emma Stone mostly rely on their technique but lack the instinct department. 
The reason why I said that Jennifer Lawrence had more luck is because she was able to star in The Hunger Games, a movie with big budget so that more people would know about her whilst simultaneously starring in an independent movie with ensemble cast (meaning that every actor is generally equal in terms of acting ability). On the other hand, Saoirse and Dakota mostly star in independent movies and with, unfortunately, mediocre casts. This is the problem that later dims their latent: an extraordinary actor should not be the only one lifting the entire mediocre cast up. As the result, Saoirse and Dakota ended up starring in movies that turned out to be flops even though their roles were interesting and their acting never diminished over times. However, I understand your view in selecting movies that have complex characters, interesting plots, and worthy performances. Saoirse certainly has these qualities but her major problems are the mediocre casts and directors and hence, you only know her via Atonement and Brooklyn. However, it looks like she finally get smarter in selecting her movies and scripts. I can‚Äôt honestly say the same thing for Dakota Fanning though.

Speaking of the critics, they‚Äôre not always right and their criteria change over time. Before the 1960s, the actresses whose nature of their roles were more merciful and benevolent were more likely to get nominated and win. Fast forwarding to now, the actresses with controversial and unorthodox roles are more likely to win an acting award. That was why Brie Larson was the frontrunner of the Golden Globe Award and Academy Award in 2016 because her role of a kidnapped mother of one was deemed more ‚Äúunorthodox‚Äù and interesting than Saoirse‚Äôs portrayal of an Irish immigrant gal in America even though their acting abilities were on the same level. Jennifer Lawrence was and is able to provide what the film critics ask for (unorthodox roles) but if she was as unlucky as Saoirse was to star in movies with mediocre casts and half-assed directors, then she would certainly suffer the same fate. And I have no problem with saying that Jennifer Lawrence has good technique but her acting has limitations in terms of creativity and revolution (notice that she always cried the same way). If she is willing to improve in the long run, then I would certainly change my judgment but for now, my criticism still stands. And I can assure that the ‚ÄúSaoirse effect‚Äù is just a tip of an iceberg. After Lady Bird, I‚Äôm sure that she would be known and a trifecta winner soon. In retrospect, the best of Saoirse Ronan is yet to come and just wait for my assessment to be proven right in the future.

On the side note, I would also like to respond to your previous comment about my criticism toward Emma Stone‚Äôs acting in La La Land. I did not pass my judgment on her audition scene but the entire package. In fact, the audition scene might look rugged and clumsily done but that was one of her best scenes in the movie. However, I could not help but notice that she brought the same ‚Äúeccentric‚Äù trait into her characters (watch Easy A, The Help, and Crazy Stupid Love to know what I‚Äôm talking about) and she was not able to portray Mia as a character with depth to the greatest height. The scene after she was devastated upon an almost empty opening night of her play was underwhelming because the way she cried seemed more like a child losing toys than an actress losing everything. I considered her ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù scene with Sebastian the most important one to showcase her flaws and Ryan‚Äôs because they were unable to express the joy to follow their paths but also the sadness to go their separate ways. That scene is the most poorly executed one out of the entire movie because the audience, including myself, was so confused by the ‚Äú5 years later‚Äù scenario. That‚Äôs why I called her winning questionable. And plus, La La Land should be celebrated for what it elevated: good storyline, great cinematography, impressive directing and the beautiful art of storytelling. A movie nominated for ‚ÄúBest Picture‚Äù usually has this trace: all of the acting roles serve as an element of the story and acting nominations do not usually end up winning. That was what happened to movies like Avatar, The Great Budapest Hotel, Argo, Birdman, Spotlight, etc. However, La La Land was celebrated for the wrong reasons because all of the nominated acting roles were also impressive on their own so the actors doing the good job of following the storyline usually had no need to revolutionize their own roles. That‚Äôs why I said that Emma Stone played by the script which happened to be a great one. And I‚Äôm fair in my criticism and Ryan Gosling has bigger flaws in his acting than Emma does. And like I said, Emma Stone KNEW herself that she had a lot to improve.",0.9994,1168

"that's easier said than done. You probably haven't been throught something like that but most of the time these victims feel powerless.  They feel like they have no recourse and that no matter what they say no one will believe them because the person that harrassed them is more powerful and more important. Imagine having a guy that has so much money and power that he can silence you and people who know in all sorts of ways ( blackmail, ruining your reputation, making sure you can't find a job, buying out or scaring the people that were willing to help) . Some of these women did say things and had their names sullied for speaking out or rejecting these men. And  cases are just so complicated and so much more easy to win for those who have money and connections that what you are asking for is very difficult and unfair. Not to mention the fact that many of these women have been scarred for life. Many will never be the same again, will never have the same self esteem. What something like that does to you psychologically is messed up.",-0.7921,205

"theordore mosby but an actor work with people, and if you can‚Äôt respect people who will want to work with that actor?. Btw it was not 1 actor, 9+ men of the production team of House of Cards make accusations to their respective bosses about Spacey inappropriate behavior, their bosses didn‚Äôt punished Spacey for that, they only communicate that this 9+ guys were not left alone with Spacey... and then more cases of guys working in theater with hin also came out. You should check all the cases. It is too hard for an adult and brilliant actor to understand that he can/should do his job without touching inappropriately his coworkers? Is that hard?",0.8402,133

"theordore mosby well I don‚Äôt know all the specific details about Trump accusations but you forgot a little detail, the Weinstein case draw a before and after of harassment accusations. Before Weinstein there were no 100% successful cases of this (for example Cosby) but after Weinstein lost all his power, everyone got shocked because it was not expected. So now all the victims feel with the power to make their cases public because they gonna be heard and the bad guy will be condemned (at least publicly). So yeah Spacey, C.K, Brettner, Weinstein they lost everything and you should not feel bad. I‚Äôm sure there are better producers, actors, comedians who are good people that will fill their spaces.",-0.9308,142
"theordore mosby well then as a lawyer, you should know that most of these offences won't be prosecuted. And I presume you'll also know, then, that in many jurisdictions, striking similarities between offences count as incriminating evidence. Most of these men seem to have a modus operandi - and for me, that's incriminating - it makes the evidence against them more persuasive. There's also something about their denials that's suspect, the way they often don't deny the behaviour, but allegege that it was consensual, seemingly without having any clue about what consent actually means. You to have an awful lot of faith in the so-called justice system for a lawyer - most lawyers that I know realise that the system is fallible, that it's often no more than a legal system that, on occasion, yields a just result. There's no guarantee that an investigation would find the truth anyway, so it's up to the public to decide whether to believe the stories or not. I think women generally find them more believable because there are very few women who haven't been harrassed in some way by at least one man and in many cases, multiplie men. It's clearly something that A LOT of men do and that NEEDS TO CHANGE. You can believe in the presumption of innocence all you want, but we all owe it to the victims of crime to treat accusers as though they may be telling the truth. That means realising that if these accusers are being truthful, it took a lot of courage for them to come out and tell their stories, knowing that in many cases, the law would be of no help to them, because there wouldn't be a trial. I feel that that shouldn't deter people from bringing these dark stories to light, because there needs to be a shift in culture, so that the women who experience harrassment/inappropriate behaviour are in the minority, not the current majority. If nothing else, these allegations mark women's card about the men concerned and they also let decent men know how pervasive this ugly problem is - that has to be a good thing. It would be shameful if we missed the opportunity for change simply because there won't be a legal trial or investigation.",0.9439,417
"theordore mosby you're clearly a dope if you think all these allegations can be ""proven"". Half of them are statute-barred, and the other half are impossible to prove. It takes a lot to prosecute these types of offences and in most of these historic cases, it's the accused's word against that of his alleged victims. But when there are numerous, seemingly unconnected  people with similar (and in some cases, almost identical), stories, then it makes sense to find the allegations more credible than the denial. What's sad is how many people are inclined to believe the word of a man over that of multiple women.",-0.7783,120
