"SUGGESTION:  1. Have someone type up your starred sections in the book, and create a small book for you to carry with you, so you can meditate on those words throughout your day.  

2. Make several copies and sell them on your website. It will be like Oprah's book club, except more of ""Quotes from What's Will Reading Now"".  I don't know about the legalities of this, if you are interested in the idea, research it.  And if you do use the idea, I would like to be mentioned as the source.

"Will you always have really incredible advice and wisdom, thanks for your thoughts. That story about Tom Cruise staying on the red carpet to sign autographs for 3 and a half hours is pretty incredible. I appreciate what you said about press tours being like a political campaign that you saw as a way to add contacts and friendships to your Empire is pretty interesting to think about- I mean..... I know so much more about what show business is today than 7 years ago. I remember you said Quincy Jones took you under his wing and taught you a lot. I wish I had someone like that to explain a lot of things to myself about what show business is. A lot of people will read this and wonder exactly what I'm talking about- It's just an endless amount of words of wisdom and insights I'd share with myself if I could go back 7 years. Mostly about how as Francis said word for word, ""The movie business is this whole screwy arrangement..."" and so much more I'd just talk about. I am guessing Quincy Jones explain things like this to you when you said he kind of ""took you under his wing."" I know you worked with Michael Bay on Bad Boys and he had this incredible piece of advice I think about a lot, saying when he first started working with Jerry Bruckheimer he told him, ""movie studio execs are in and out like musical chairs, every 5 years you go to a studio and its totally different people running it."" and he literally said, ""just remember movie execs are working on borrowed time"" and to remember that in the business and promotional and showmanship and keeping your own personal stock high side of the industry.
