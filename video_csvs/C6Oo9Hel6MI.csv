"Oh wow, this makes me feel so much better about my channel.  When I thought you were doing everything on your own getting such slick looking videos so often, I felt like I was somehow not doing enough (which I should do more anyway, but you get the point). The fact that you have a team help you is awesome and also demonstrates that it really does take a village to get things done, especially if you want to get a bunch of content out and you value your time.

Then it cuts to Anna typing on the laptop with just one hand, while using the other hand to hold the laptop above her lap, BECAUSE THERE IS A CAT ON HER LAP.  She isn't petting the cat; it's just taking up space.  Totally cracked me up.",0.4404,86
