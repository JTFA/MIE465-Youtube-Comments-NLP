All the go cartoons have been great! But this one isn't even decent. The bags don't add anything to the show just make the characters less engaging. also the humor just isn't funny or clever (especially compared to the other go toons). Its facebooky humor. -2 out of 10,0.7016,57

"Bagheads as a show? Having a bag on your head should just be a silly character trait for a side character not the entire creative idea for a show. If you remove the bags then it's just a sitcom. You could make them balloon heads and it would be the same thing. Gumball dies this right by having one gag being specific to one character and adds variety to the world and their interaction with each other. And the curiosity of how they interact and work off each other is a great part of the show.
It's why I hate many modern games, shows and movies cause they take one theme and that's it. They don't explore with different ones and make something not linear that keeps you guessing. Or even better. Make it up yourself. Like Rayman.
It's more like the original theme is fairy tales. But not just fairies and talking wolves but really the fantasy and building up an imaginary world that doesn't exist.
Mushrooms balancing on each other, space pirates and morbid ghosts on rags and bone and enemies in cloth of a black being called hoodlums with homes and lands with unique architecture and random big plants and houses of weird designs and curved and crooked parts that aren't even.
I love creativity like that much more than flat floors and one gag",-0.8467,244

"Hey, Cartoon Hangover. I think you should take a second look at the team behind this, they have potential. 

If they took the artstyle, dialogue, direction and animation, and applied it to a more interesting concept than a family of bagheads, they could actually produce a great modernized homage to 90s/00s era cartoons. This short is already refreshing against the barrage of Adventure time inspired shows.",0.9117,78
