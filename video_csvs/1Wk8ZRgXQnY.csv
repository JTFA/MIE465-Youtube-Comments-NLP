"I'm sorry if I seem impatient,
I'm not a fan of pleasantries...
See, I get bored with the weather and what's in the news,
The topics we all hide beneath.

Could not care less about your day job,
Gossip or ordinary stress...
See, every relationship I've ever loved,
Starts with someone says

Show me where it hurts,
And give me something real,
And lead me to the part of you that never really heals...
And say the words that burn,
When they leave your mouth.
Yeah, tell me your story...
But don't leave the good parts out.

And tell me all about your failures,
Little things that make you cry...
And tell me the acts that you preach but cannot seem to practice,
That leave you compromised.

Show me where it hurts,
And give me something real,
And lead me to the part of you that never really heals...
And say the words that burn,
When they leave your mouth.
Yeah, tell me your story...
But don't leave the good parts out.

I've seen your trophies, your highlight reels,
You know I would love you still
If you lost it all...
And I love the castle that you have built,
But I am asking still to let down the walls.

Show me where it hurts,
And give me something real,
And lead me to the part of you that never really heals...
And say the words that burn,
When they leave your mouth..
Tell me your story.
Show me where it hurts, yeah,
Oh, to the part of you that never really heals...
And show me where it hurts, whoa,
Tell me your story...
But don't leave the good parts out.
Don't leave the good parts out...

"If love Andy so much, but if you heard his concert version before he released this, IT WAS EVEN BETTER. I am disappointed with this version conpared to the other one. In concert he slowed it down and was more serious and didn't have a pop sound to it. I so bad want him to do a single like the concert version without an audience. Good Parts ❤",-0.5745,74
