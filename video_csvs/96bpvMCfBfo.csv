"Verse 1]
There goes my heart beating
Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now

[Chorus]
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

[Verse 2]
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
If I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe

[Chorus]
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

[Bridge]
I don't want to fight no more
I don't want to hide no more
I don't want to cry no more come back, I need you to hold me
(You are the reason)
A little closer now, just a little closer now
Come a little closer, I need you to hold me tonight
You are the reason

[Outro]
I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason",-0.9452,252

"When I was very little, my father did some bad things...he got drunk, hung out with two other woman and abused my mother...my mother couldn't take any longer after my sister was born. So she decided to get a divorce. They were never together after that ever again. 

Years later..he came very little, came to pick us up and drop us off again some Saturdays..but then stopped. He even stayed away for two years once. I was so upset because my dad and I, I wouldn't say close, but we were tighter than my little sister was with him..so it kinda hurt me more..my sister never really knew him..she has that kinda pain. And I also didn't understand what was going on and why this was happening. And I mean you can expect that from a little girl of 7 years old...

As I grew older, I learned to hate him..while I knew that was wrong and I knew that the right thing to do is to forgive him....but I was so angry at him for leaving and hurting us that...that I wanted to kill him. I wanted him dead. That's how bad my anger got. I would yell at my mom like kids normally do and fight with my sister..but that wasn't because I was normal. It was out of anger. 

One normal day, my mother told me..that he was coming over..
The moment she said it, I got so scared and ran to my sister's room grabbed her by the wrist and dragged her into the bathroom and locked the door. When my father showed, I didn't come out. At all. He tried everything and tried talking me into coming out of the bathroom, but I never did. At one point I told him that I thought that he should leave. So he did....or so we thought..minutes later a saw him coming back up the street. He was carrying something in his hands. I hid in the bathroom again but my sister stayed. Untill...my uncle came knocking on the door...saying: "" I think you should come out and see..""  
I was crying then..and so I gave in, opened the door...went into the kitchen..only to find...a little baby boy. I had a brother. HALF brother. We ALL gave in and ' oohed ' and ' awwed ' not knowing this was the biggest mistake ever. He came back with the baby to distract us. From what was going on. He was there to come talk out the problem. NOT the little baby he made. Leaving my sister and I in the dust. Rejected. He promised he would be around more. He left. Never came back. 

Now all this happend almost six years ago. He's been sending ' I love you ' s on every BIRTHDAY and CHRISTMAS and no other time. He keeps asking to see us. We say NO everytime. Why? He asks. Because you have done enough damage. And everytime you lie and NEVER come back. Now you have two sons. One probably five, the other..one? What about your daughters? The one is 14 and the other 13. You have ruined our childhood. It wasn't all that normal. 

The reason why I said all this now..was because...two days ago it was my birthday..he sent a msg..in it saying that I should listen to this song. Sorry for the depression. 

Yes he's my biological FATHER. 
But he will NEVER be a DAD to me. 

I hope ur satisfied with what you have done..you shitty human being.",-0.9985,709
