I wish I could be back there and give you a giant hug pandas years when you were getting bored being those two years when you were doing with pain and just give you a giant hug and say that I was there for you and that I appreciated and respected and loved you Rebecca if we ever made you must accept the hugs I'm a very Huggy person don't know why I am but I love giving hugs there's such a nice way to show appreciation and also unlike a lot of things or kissing can be deemed as sexual or some other thing hugs are just I give you digital hug and I know this is just a really long drawn-out version of I want to give you a hug I tend to put a lot of what I'm saying into formal into more formal words and repeat myself indifferent ways like I want to give you a hug and I want to hug you and now I'm just repeating myself that I want to hug you when you're sad and tell you that I loved and appreciated and respected you and I know this is long but if you see this Rebecca I just want you to know but I've been doing with the love hard times my parents got divorced and it's been really hard coping with my dad getting new girlfriend and my mom getting a new boyfriend but now we moved in with and I have depression and my life has just been awful recently but your videos when they smile to my face every time I'm feeling sad they make me feel a lot better and my brother he......... died... Recently I didn't even get a chance to see him I'm almost giving birth and it was either have her alive or have the baby they picked mom so before I even got to see his face my brother was dead and if anyone else is reading this thank you for taking the time and if you reply I just want you to know something I'm very shy and timid person and if anyone responds or anything like that I kind of feel overwhelmed to have a continuing conversation even if you are both polite respectable and you know not being just that you suck person you get what I'm saying cow sounds like I'm explaining a relationship but it's not you it's me I just get really stressed when I'm having a continuing conversation with someone digitally not counting like my mom and my friends but you know random strangers even though I'm 17 and also whoever you are if you're Rebecca or some other person if you are sanitary and you are nice I will give you a hug a digital hug so yeah and I just wanted to end on this I love you,0.9988,486

"So im late to this, but I relate to your prep school part SO MUCH. I use to be creative (though kinda crazy) pretty happy, and very social. Then I went to prep school, and it was tiny (Pre K -12th, uniforms etc.) Then I became socially awkward because they all hated me for being dramatic, and weird. I became very unhappy, I didn't like talking very much anymore, and I hit my emo phase due to this. I started getting a lot of anxiety issues and depression, and I was EVIL for liking Yugioh or something like that.

 I also became pretty hateful, I was homophobic (Christian school), I accepted no opinions other than my own etc. I think the first step into me getting a little better was 7th grade, I heard of these people who watched the show My Little Pony, and my reaction was immediately using pretty rude words (I would call them faggots, and stuff like that.) Then my curiosity got ahold of me, why did these people like this show? So I started watching, and became obsessed for a bit, but it helped me become less hateful, because I realized I was being a dick for no reason. 

Then that same year however I started having a lot of mental breakdowns (Not as bad as 6th grade where I had a suicide attempt) and I had a lot of depression, also my love for the show My Little Pony got out, and I was treated awfully, I started begging my parents to go to public school, and I finally did. 

What I loved most even before school even started I could enroll into choir and acting, two passions I had were open to me, I never had that option before. 8th grade was probably one of the best years of my whole life, I found my best friend from 3rd grade, and ended up becoming best friends again, and thanks to him I became social even though I planned to stay anti social, I was still weird to people, but I made so many friends. Public school made me so happy.

 I also feel im much more emotionally stable because of the switch, and slowly my anxiety, social issues, and other things have gotten better, not too fast because a personality doesn't change over night, but ive made so much progress from the hateful, emo, non willing to listen, anti social kid I was in private school. Anyways this comment got pretty long, but it's funny I just relate to your private school to high school part so much it was unbelievable to me.",0.7972,504
