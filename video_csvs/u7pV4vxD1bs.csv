"Being a truck driver myself,  we experience traffic stopping and not letting us back into our docking areas. Drivers don't usually back up for us truck drivers,  they are mean and nasty and impatient. Not all drivers mind you,  there are those people who do back up and are considerate . The  autonomous vehicle stopped but did not back up to allow the semi to properly dock.  Both are are at fault,  semi for not getting out and looking to see if it was clear to proceed and the autonomous for not backing up. Clear as day.

Plus, I was in Las Vegas a couple weeks ago and I saw this autonomous vehicle circulatingon Fremont already",-0.5247,126
"Bullshit,  the truck was backing into the alley to make a delivery. He's almost all the way in. The news reporter keeps claiming he pulled out. If the driver is backing in he has right of way.

Problem with this is that it can't think and make important decisions.

A machine cannot do that and can never do that.",-0.8052,77
"Yes, sounds like an oversight for sure! I imagine you would have to think WAY outside the box when implementing a driverless vehicle. And this is such an example. I am guessing it stopped with enough distance for a regular vehicle that may have stopped ahead. But NOT for this situation which is a semi-truck that is out in the road way preparing to back into a loading area! You would need to leave WAY more distance knowing it was going to back up towards you which most human drivers would easily recognize. And where was the horn or some kind of sound alert when the truck starting getting closer to an impending collision? If a human driver was in such a situation where all of sudden I saw a big rig backing up knowing it might not see me in its mirrors I would be honking my horn like a madman - as well as prepare to back away. Hope this serves as a great learning for this technology so that something like this doesn't happen where someone might get injured!",0.9475,192
