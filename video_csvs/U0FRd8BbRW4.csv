Someone needs to investigate if channels can influence what YouTube puts on the trending page. This is was on there right before Boldly released their video where they attempt to recreate this scene. Seems suspicious. I miss the days when the trending page was for videos that were actually trending instead now where YouTube only promotes TV based YouTube channels like The tonight show and etc.,0.5106,70
