"Gayle is the real deal and I believe that once she and Norah go through the new sexual harrassment training class, now required of all CBS employees, that we will hear from her again - and this has nothing to do with Charlie Rose.

One of the most obvious examples show Norah bragging on air  to a guest about the hilarious ""sex talk"" among the three of them.  No one is talking about this now for fear of  blurring the issue between Rose's very serious, criminal harassment/assault charges and Gayle and Norah's workplace ""no-no's.""  The media corps. are late on this.  Corporate America began requiring ""sexual harassment in the workplace"" training 15 years ago and so I predict they will be appropriately appalled at their behavior, which, as the training universally reads ""is met with serious disciplinary action up to and including termination.""   People like Charlie Rose just need to be removed from the workplace but the conversation also involves the danger and inappropriateness of the much more common types of behavior that Norah and Gayle demonstrated to all of us on live, national TV - actions which according to the legal, employee signed document called ""the sexual harassment manual"", and another reason why we're not talking about this now, is considered sexual harassment towards Charlie!  The conversation does go a little deeper and it involves men AND women and I bet Gayle will be the one to spark it on national tv.  Thanks for listening....",-0.9557,309

"Well, this is what happens when you put women in the workplace. There's always sexual tension. Human beings look for sex inmates. Technically women in medicine should be separate that's the reason why Muslims believe that women should guard their modesty. A cover themselves I don't want women in the workplace. I astoundingly offended that women are in the military sharing the same tense in many cases and in fact I hate the fact that women are on submarines with men and battleships with the men that bothers me. Because I truly believe that men and women should be separate because sex is always going to happen between the two. But unfortunately women probably need to work for the men are not to be where the men are at. And that's the problem.",-0.7288,143
