Great job!! I will subscribe.",0.9752,82
"Food outside of USA is always better,because here it is filled with big companies that put shit in food to make people get more and more of it and in other locations they dont have Big names putting shit and doing everything they do here.
Even the ""happiest place on earth"" has specific machines that implement smells around the park to bring in people to buy more.
When I visit Mexico, Juarez and Tijuana,passing the threshold of crossing the border,you wont see any big names or food chain restaurants,you wont see much of bigmacs or greasy fries.Other places are so different in food wise compared to USA",0.0258,120
