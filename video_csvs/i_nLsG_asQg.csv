"Born in 88

Climbed trees with no ropes or harness, old Mans Truck had the pop out window that was the air conditioner, played hide and seek, best spot was in the culvert pipe under the road. Horseshoes in the back yard all night under brightness of construction work lights. Club houses and forts in the woods. Fishing all summer long every day. Riding bikes everywhere we wanted to go. Cussing got you a mouth full of soap. Rain hitting the awning of the tin roof. B.B. gun and daddy’s beer can. Wish I was 8 years old again",0.765,115
"Brings back memories. My dad and I rode together in his pick up truck over many years. We had a lot of great conversations, and used to listen to Brenda Lee, Dolly, Buck Owens, Johnny Cash, Mel Tillis, Glenn Campbell, Reba, Loretta, and more. I sure miss those times with my dad. My dad could really whistle well (in tune). I miss simple times and wonderful music that told stories. This new song of Blake’s takes me “home”.",0.8754,100

"Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Chrisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand where
Them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them old Duke boys, they're flattening their heels
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawnmower around
I'd go back there right now
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
