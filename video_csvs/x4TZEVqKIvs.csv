"TL;DR Sharpay is actually the hero, trying to keep the school normal in spite of Troy and Gabriela messing it up, being the objective villains of the series. Also, antropology lecture/rant below.

Putting it like that, Sharpay is totally not a villain. She's actually shoehorned into the movie as an antagonist for the sake of having an antagonist, in a movie (franchise) that celebrates a good-looking douche getting everything he wants before he even knows he wants it and his good-looking super-nerdy girlfriend causing a massive upheaval in the school, where the status quo is torn down like the Berlin wall, plunging these poor youths into a state where nothing is certain or safe to assume. While individuality and diversity is good, NO labels or groups WHATSOEVER is just chaos. Lack of order and predictability is shown to be harmful and possibly even traumatic for developing minds. Some science says that line goes at roughly 20 years of age, so EVERYONE in HSM is in this vulnerable group. The solidification of cliques in HS age is a healthy sign of youths crystalizing into stable adults after the childhood and early teens where trying everything and finding some things that can work is the deal. Many of the traits shown and nurtured in these HS cliques are carried on into adulthood, albeit more matured and refined. Sharpay is deeply concerned about this development, perhaps because it would mean she's not going to be the popular glamdoll by default anymore, but it is a truly worrying prospect.

You're welcome for a probably very controversial lecture on contemporary western antropology, based for the most part on personal observations by a high-functional autist (me).",0.4544,312
