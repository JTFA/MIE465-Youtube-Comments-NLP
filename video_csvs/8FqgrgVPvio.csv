"(I'm sure no one's reading,  but i forgot to actually say WHAT i changed) 

- i took a drama class to force myself to be less shy (i was failing Spanish because i was too shy to participate). it was a rough semester,  but it turns out that acting is my very favorite thing, and i ended up winning a community theater award my senior year

- I'm still kind of shy, but i force myself to talk to people, because otherwise they think I'm a snob, whether or not that's fair

- i have OCD, but i used to be a lot less functional (think Aza on a bad day. that was me). it literally felt like killing myself, but i forced my way out of many rituals and thought spirals before i even knew that OCD was a thing (i was only actually diagnosed last year after a very rare recurrence). 

my disease, like my personality trait of shyness, aren't gone and aren't leaving. i have good days and bad days. but i didn't and don't give in to either one entirely. none of us should give in to our tendencies entirely. what a nightmare of a world that would be,  and what a sad existence for ourselves to never live outside our molds.",-0.9789,244
"A big thing I changed recently is how I end conversations, specifically while at work. I am a Leader in my workplace and instead of ending conversations with just ""Thanks,"" I'm trying to change it to ""Thanks, do you need anything from me?""  That simple question is changing how people interact and view me as a leader and has helped the morale of the team substantially.",0.0,76
"A couple years ago, I read the much ballyhooed book “Quiet” by Susan Cain, because my introversion, for the most part, has not served me well. The book, alas, told me lots of stuff I already know (like how almost all of the world today is set up to promote and reward extroverts), but did not offer any advice on how to CHANGE, or even how to best get along as an introvert in this extroverted world. In any case, I would much like to become more outgoing, better at mingling, and less self-conscious in a crowd. (And by the way, Hank, I got an X on my Myers-Briggs test too!)",0.964,134
"A few years ago I met a couple people who did not were a good company. They made me feel a horrible person that needed to change completely. I tried and in the end, not only with the changing but because of the toxic relationship I got depression and several panic attacks. 

I tried to change to be a better person, and I became worse. It's been 2 years since I start my treatment and after finally feel myself again, I realized I am not the same. I am more confident, but still don't have the focus that I used to have before, which it has been difficult to read my books (which I love to do). But in the same time, I am finnally smiling more than years ago. I am able to enjoy the life more than before. 

But for me, what makes me feel myself again is the feeling of empathy for others. Something that always make me feel human, to have not only affection with people, but be sad with them and be happy with them. 

I am saying that to remind all those who do not feel like themselves and depressed that we can be ourselves again, don't be afraid to fight for yourself. It's worth it.",-0.8805,236
"A few years ago, I was doing many activities through my week that I did solely for other people. I wasn’t enjoying them myself, and the stress of all these activities gradually led to me having anxiety. I didn’t understand at the time that my family would still love me just as much even if I didn’t like the hobbies they thought it would be cool if I was into. 

Now, I do things in my life for myself. I do things I enjoy and love, and I managed to conquer my anxiety while I was at it.",0.9393,113
"A little more than ten years ago, I made a conscious effort to weaken my inner monologue. I wanted it to say fewer things, and to say those things with less urgency. With some work, I made this happen. Now I feel things more directly and spend more time just perceiving. This came with some downsides. I got worse at writing, for instance. But it came with a lot of upsides. I got calmer. I became less judgmental.

I hope in the future to be able to rely on myself more. I hope that when I tell myself I'm going to do something in the future, I will be more likely to do it.",0.2128,130
"A search for ""INTP in a Rut"" will send you to a terribly long, boring video I made several years ago. For some reason, it is also my most popular video. I'm not directing you to watch it, but I would encourage a perusal of the comments. To sum up, it's mostly people telling me that I couldn't possibly be an INTP, because blah blah blah. Aside from the pretty obvious misogyny behind some of those comments, there is this disturbing idea that these people think an INTP just CAN'T or WOULDN'T do or say what i do, how do. As I told some of them, I'm fairly certain that what lies behind their vitriol is fear and confusion, for here is this person claiming to be ""one of them"" who doesn't fit the box. They may be afraid to see evidence that they COULD change if they wanted to.  The reason I put stock in MBTI is that,  the more I look into it,  the clearer it becomes to me that I am,  and always have been, an INTP (I did test differently as a teenager, but I think it is fairly common,  trying to change your nature as a teen, experimenting with your personality. I was trying very hard to be more outgoing, and I was much more emotional as an hormonal teenager. But I eventually reverted to my base out of exhaustion); however,  I have often said that if the description of your type fits you PERFECTLY, then you may not have done much introspection or made much personal growth. My personality is just about the worst suited for functioning in this society, but I have worked very hard to make it work and get out of my comfort zone. Some people are too afraid to do this, so they get protective of their defined boxes. To me, that's where it gets out of hand. I still find MBTI extremely helpful. Before MBTI, I really had no idea that most other people had SUCH different ways of thinking to mine.  It explains so many of the difficulties and advantages I've had, and it helps me understand where others are coming from.  OOPS, I see I've written an essay. (kinda typical, really)",0.8552,425

"Aside from my caligraphy, which is now way better and cooler, I changed a lot of what I believe and see about the world, life and spirituality. Now, I know this sounds gay and it seems the start of ""how I met God"", but is actually the opposite. This is how I found out the world doesn't need a God (hold your hounds), I don't need to put my strength in something else, I learned how to trust my own strength. And after that I also stop being so averse to faith and religion, as long people are not hurting or being assholes to each other, we can all be fine.
The thing I most want for my future is that I become able to live doing the thing I most love, what makes me feel alive, not only by stop wasting time but also by gaining money doing this stuff.

"First, I love this video and all the amazing comments inspired by it

I've intentionally changed myself in a lot of ways, though I know that it's true how hard it is because I also notice how often I fall back into old habits or patterns.  
I tried to become as kind as possible--and I actually think I was quite successful at that, to the point that I saw a little bit of my personality reflected in the ""too nice""-ness of Jane Bennet in LBD.  Then, I focused on trying to be as authentic as possible, and have the courage to share some of the more deeper and intimate parts of myself in order to have genuine and meaningful relationships with others.
But I've been a perfectionist for about as long as I can remember.  In middle and high school, this manifested in a lot of hatred of myself.  I've grown so much since then, becoming a leader and mentor in the outdoor program at my college and surpassing my own expectations of what I thought I was capable of.  Last year I graduated, and it was tough because I struggled with some self-esteem and mental health issues that I thought I had grown out of.  Because of the high expectations I have for myself, sometimes I still feel that I am not good enough, no matter how great my accomplishments are.  I remind myself that I am deeply loved by others and that I am actually worthy of that love, but it's a constant work, and some days it comes more naturally than others. So, this year, I am working on better self-care, and turning some of that radical kindness and love for the world that I have cultivated inward now and then, because I want to be the kind of person I am in the moments when I truly feel like I've accepted myself and that I'm enough.",0.9941,350
"For the last five years or so I’ve been slowly working on trying new foods.

A goal of mine moving forward is to build confidence in my choices, whether those choices are big or small. If I say I liked a book & someone else says they hated it, my automatic assumption has always been “they’re right, I’m wrong, obviously.” But I want to change that & own my choices & my truths.",0.1655,155

"Here's one that's not too heavy. I changed the way I dress.

Now I only wear clothes I love the look of or that make me happy, or remind me of things I like. It's more about me than it is about my outward appearance.

I now do cardio and strength training at least three days a week, and while my body doesn't necessarily reflect that cause YES FOOD I am occasionally struck with the fact that I was the type of person who actively avoided and hated any and all physical activity. It's just funny how a mind can shift like that.

As for what I'd like to work on, being able to process and accept criticism is a huge thing. I still have anxiety around someone approaching me and giving me feedback about how I work.

I've changed a lot about myself over the years but that was the first one that came to mind. I used to be kind of obsessed with figuring out what my 'true' personality was and I would take all these personality tests because I wanted someone to tell me who I was. In the end I realised that you are who you are becoming. Whatever character trait you choose to practice, you gain that trait over time.

"I'm writing the first part of this comment before I watch the video, because I am a Psychology major at university and this test is talked about way too often. I think, although personality tests like Myers-Briggs have the power to classify us under categories, people change. A personality test cannot necessarily measure change or aspects of our personality accurately. Yes, it can convey a large amount of them. Nonetheless, certain tendencies and mannerisms of our personality stay the same. I guess that is what most of these tests are based on. But basing our personalities off of a personality test or questionnaire may miss out on things we cannot measure. 

Something I have changed about myself: How I judge others and view the world. In high school, I was a rather judgmental person and had trouble ""imagining others complexly."" As I started college and became a part of Nerdfighteria, I realize that how I viewed others, gossiped, and made comments about people in my daily life was not decreasing worldsuck but adding to it.

I can now make chitchat with strangers, introduce myself to people, and message friends - when all of those things used to be impossible for me.

"It's 1 am and I'm an ESL speaker so I'm probably not too coherent but I'm also a therapist and I have to speak up. Hank, I understand your philosophical point, but you are misunderstanding and thus misrepresenting psychological and personality testing. 

It's science. Even though there is truth that test measure basically what they say they measure on the manual - they measure not physical things, but theoretical constructs represented through certain behaviors, like specific answers on a test. And those constructs can be argued. But the relation between those signs and the constructs measured is found through very complex and specific math/statistics/clinical research. You can argue What they're measuring (thus the many different intelligence tests corresponding to different theories of what intelligence is), but the fact that They Measure That Thing is scientifically sound.

And the subject of whether the thing they're measuring is a stable trait or a changing one, the psychic structure vs state, and the eternal nature/nurture question is definitely not a thing psychologists just missed. They depend on the specific test you're thinking of, but it's a thing that's always researched and each evaluation technique has its answer on which traits are stable and which aren't.

Add to it the fact that some tests simply place you in a position relative to all the other people in your country/age group thanks to an extensive statistic study (like IQ tests) while others aim to describe the specific way your psyche works, and the subject is MUCH more complex than just ""don't put yourself in a box"".

"Something i have changed about myself. Well this may not be a good thing or idk depends on situation i guess, is that i'm more psyched to share stuff. Not physical stuff but like mental ideas amd concepts and to prove my worth more academically than ever. It may make me seem like i'm only concentrated on being the best and self centered and to some extent i kinda agree. I hope to tone it down or at least show it at appropriate times. Im also a person who is easily nervous and gets stressed out so im trying to learn how to calm myself quicker in an emotional situation in order to make more rational decisions.",0.9735,124
"The Myers-Briggs test annoys me because it's a hijacked system which was much, much deeper - and that system was all about self-awareness (or highlighting a lack of it) and change - or rather: bring ourselves into balance.  It's based on an approach that would be used in long-term psychotherapeutic analysis.  That it's being used in such a pop way now is sooo annooyinnng.

Part of the point is that in Jung's original observations about psychological types - we have a conscious sense of self (your test results) and a somewhat equal-opposite ""shadow"".. Our ""type"" will also indicate our opposite, undeveloped or suppressed self.. then there is a sense of how to understand the individual's way of seeing the world, and themselves.. and whether it's balanced or not (e.g. an extremely extroverted person might never engage in introspection, they might even be afraid to be alone).  

The people responsible for this total reduction of something ultra-deep have done it order to make some money.  It comes as no surprise.  If there's something profound around, and it can be rendered 2D and bitesize for the sake of money - someone will do it.",-0.3891,221
"This is small, but about a year and a half ago I decided I would make my handwriting better. I write in cursive now and I'm actually really proud of the way I write. It's a little thing that gives me more opportunities for positive self-talk.",0.9616,50

"To me, saying that personality cannot be classified because it changes every hour and ever situation, is equal to saying that global warming isnt real because its snowing in winter.
That is to say climate is to weather as personality is to mood.
That being said, standard personality tests are better at determining your mood more than your personality, a better personality test would be some sort of app that gives you a few questions hourly that you can answer on a scale and repeats questions randomly several times in order to average out your answers and get your personality range with the the median scores",0.7506,112

"Well, I know compared to me 3-6 years ago, I resent outgoing people a lot less/not at all. I was pretty edgy about it in junior high but in high school I started convincing myself that everyone has their own things going on, their own strengths. It’s partly an inevitable maturity thing, not being angry at other people, but I also like my tendency to try really hard to see things from other perspectives.

More recently it’s harder to say how I’ve changed though. I haven’t done much to bring about change. Being more confident in my identity as an artist, and my identity in general, maybe.",0.9661,130
"What I've changed: trying to be less of a perfectionist, because around other people it makes me unnecessarily critical.

What I want to change: having enough confidence to stay interested in and motivated by a project even if I lack external validation. And be less anxious (ha!).",0.7584,56
"When I talk to people now I ask questions relentlessly. Especially when I am trying to understand what people mean when they talk to me. I started actively doing that 7 or 8 years ago when I realised that  I didnt really understand things as they were being explained to me. In my mid-20's I would have done no such thing, I just pretended to understand all the time.",0.0258,78
"When I was younger I always really admired characters in TV shows who were super witty and were able to come up with good responses in the moment. Over time I've definitely gotten better at this, as I've practiced again and again feeling more comfortable, genuine, and confident in my everyday interactions.
My current aspiration is to develop a good work ethic. I have like 5 tabs open on my phone with ideas on how to do this, but the first step I've been taking is learning to value future rewards over instant gratification by making myself go to bed earlier and at a consistent time.",0.9764,114
