"@Linus: Some ""Tech quickie"" channel got created to steal your official content.

Most of the YT reviews of the Ergodox (EZ, Infinity, Dactylus - yes, there are three main hardware versions of the Ergodox) are rather positive but the EZ is the one mostly commented upon because you don't have to build it (Captain Obvious was here :p ). A review of the Infinity version of the Ergodox is here: https://youtu.be/H73f2a0-ZAw and it's a good addition to linus' take on the EZ version.

Now I don't know about you but the RGB aesthetics argument never even hit home to me and a braided middle wire is anything but hard to find in your local tech store if you really want to change it. Same goes for the wristpads, I'd tend to take a peek at that Wristocat™ gadget I heard about if my typing style wasn't pianist-inspired (round fingers, as you'd hold an orange in each palm).

A few things I learn from other YT videos:
– If you plan on touch typing and completely outspeed your former self, this is the one. The ortholinear keys actually prevent you from typing some keys with multiple fingers, forcing you to type with extreme accuracy. This may be very hard at first because, let's face it, ortholinear keyboards aren't exactly mainstream. Combine it with Plover, and you're good to go.
– If you're an app developer, this keyboard may be more useful than you'd expect because the amount of layers allows for some pretty darn useful shortcuts (cf. https://youtu.be/-aSLpI4Q-hE ).
– Massdrop often provides drops for stylish caps (sometimes borderline WTF stylish). In order to properly use the centremost keys you'll need to replace the original keycaps by deeper/thicker keycaps.

On a personal note, I *don't* have an Ergodox, just using a MX Board 6.0, but this keyboard is on my wishlist (05/Jan/2018) somewhere along other porntech stuff.",0.9783,369
