Dr Luke, from other celeb accounts, seems to¬†have a Simon Cowell personality (well, before Simon became a daddy since he's apparently soft these days).¬†i can see Kesha not taking Luke's comments well, or even accurately, and wanting to get away from him. and being bound by Sony, she had to devise a way to break free. those tears could definitely be from all her lies and sick mind.",0.7501,212

"Robert Miller I am buying this trash, yes. These women are powerful, NOW, and in comparison to you or I. They weren't powerful in comparison to their producers, directors, etc., especially before they became stars. I believe that this is a real problem because I am a woman, so I have experienced sexual harassment and attempted assault, and because women I love have been raped in their lives. I have personally fought off an assailant twice, once physically and once by outwitting him (I was not dating either person, and no, they didnt manage to hurt me). In order to keep a job that paid enough to support us, my own Mom had to suffer through awful harassment by bosses and coworkers for years. So I understand the complexity of it. ( It's not really your fault if you don't, but you could at least try-- ask some women whom you love and respect to tell you about their experiences, and just listen. Your own Mom could've been assaulted or even raped. She'd be unlikely to burden you with that info. ) Does that mean every accusation is true? Of course not!! Are most men rapists, or even exploitative? No. My husband is a sterling guy. But yes, many men and women in power abuse their power regularly, and a percentage of the powerful men in the entertainment industry have been notorious for this for a hundred years. If you read books by film historians (say, Gregory Mank) you will find copious stories about it, some truly awful. As for Kesha...whether her accusations are true or not, not being omniscient, i can't say. But Kesha's claims that Dr Luke was emotionally abusing her and caused her to develop bulimia are like...four years old. This song was written something like two years ago, and was released months before Metoo was even a hashtag. So its hard to say she's jumping on any bandwagons. Swearing under oath that some of her accusations against Luke were not true seems to have been a thing she did just to get out of her contract. But no, you didn't answer my question...how do you feel about Lauper's advocacy for LGBT rights? Do you admire that?",-0.9638,431

People act passionate in their performances all the time, even when they didn't write the song and the song isn't about them.",-0.34,95
"marsha okhiria that wasn't a deal because after that she tried to sue him for sexually assaulting her and is still claiming he did, so you can throw that out the window. People sometimes take plea bargains so they get lesser time, but she is the accuser, not the accused. I'm not being biased because I am a victim of sexual assault and I also think many people in hollywood have been sexually assaulted, so you can throw that out as well. Look, I can't say she's not really distraught, but I don't think she's distraught about being sexually assaulted. She can be distraught because she isn't happy with herself for lying. She can be distraught that people don't believe her lie. She can be distraught that she can't get out of her Sony contract, no matter how many lies she comes up with. Maybe she's also acting like she's distraught like many singers do. I've seen Michael Jackson cry to songs he didn't write. For instance, he cried every time he sang ""she's out of my life"" and that song was written by quincy jones, and it's about one of quincy jones' prior relationships. Then you have people who just fake cry to their songs and scream in them. If she performs this song 100 times, I bet she will have the same reaction every time. Singers, and people in hollywood, are great at acting. They know how to sell something. We as the consumers are too gullible sometimes. And if you couldn't tell she was fake crying throughout the performance, not dropping one tear, maybe you're biased. Her makeup wasn't smeared at all. I've even seen people cry who were LYING about something. Just because someone is convincing, doesn't mean they're telling the truth. I worked with kids and even saw a kid cry when she was lying to my face and I caught her in the lie. She was able to cry on cue. It's scary that some people can do that. What is your reasoning for believing her besides her convincing performance? What evidence do you have that she was sexually assaulted and drugged? You do realize that is ruining someone else's life and career, so I hope you have some solid evidence. If not, why do you believe her?",-0.9911,430

When he was hurting her, she should have come out right away, but she waited for over decade and that is something very strange for me. 
When in real life crime happen, you go to police right away and report it. Imagine people would solve all the problems this way. How it would end up?
After he raped her (and she said he did it multiple times) then she should at least once go to the hospital and they could find his DNA in her vagina. And that would be proof which could help her cut ties with him and she could actually get him to jail - even when he is powerful producer.
Law is not based on publics opinion! Look - Sony is not promoting Kesha at all. I live in central Europe, and here, people totally forget she exists. They don't play her songs in the radio and they don't talk about her in media. 
Look at this discussion - most od the people are hating on her. I feel like only her fans are supporting her and public don't give a damn. 
But this is just my subjectiv opinion.
Don't worry about grammar, English is pretty much my third language so I suck :)",-0.8316,252
melissa saint its got nothing to do with bs celebrity shit and thefact Kesha admitted to lying once trying to get out of a bad contract she signed. Now shes jumping on this me too crap. All these strong famous women were being forced into things repeatedly? You are actually buying this trash? Cindy really went through things. Not this Kesha who sings about devil worship and being a whore. Awful perfomance by the way. Did that answer your question?,-0.9734,88
"melissa saint see and that is the thing in my opinion. All he wants is his money. He invested in her a lot. She could simply pay herself out just like Zayn Malik did when he left 1D. There was no way for her to win her case without any evidence. She should have knew better.
And they are not technically working together. But everything Kesha does is Luke's property including lyrics and melodies and she has to pay him royalties.
I am very curious what will happen now and how it will all end up. But honestly, I don't see a bright future in music business for Kesha anymore. Especially if he really will win the last case.",0.9215,131
"melissa saint she is! She was ruled out from the court and Dr. Luke is apperently on best way to win his defamation case against her.
Plus she signed 8 albums contract with him, so she needs to record 5 more albums with his label üòâ
P.s. you, people, are unbelievable. Before you talk about something, check the actuall facts.",0.8777,72
