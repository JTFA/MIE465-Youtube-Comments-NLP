You've done your Base jump with your super cool Wing Suit and instead of spoiling that nicely packed chute, you just ""pop in"" to the nearest, madly diving aircraft with a wide open maw for getting rid of Guys like you that don't have nifty Wing Suits and you are Golden! I guess you just beat it back to the ""Chopper"" and Que up again on another precipice to make like an Eagle with your tail on fire, one more time.
