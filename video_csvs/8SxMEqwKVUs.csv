"+ Andrew Jackson.      All of that is unverifiable until the underlying classified material is released. Short of that, the memo's entire scenario is based on a simple ""Believe Me!"".

"Amanda Bell 
They altered it to not release classified information until the appropriate time.
Here's a run down of the Memo.
-The DOJ and FBI conducted electronic surveillance on Carter Page (a US citizen and volunteer adviser to Trump's campaign).
-They perform this under a FISA probable cause order with three renewals of 90 days each for a total of 360 days of electronic surveillance.
-For the FBI, Director James Comey signed 3 of the FISA applications and Andrew McCabe (fired by his boss after reading the memo) signed 1.
-On the DOJ side, Sally Yates, Dana Boente (literally who?), and Rod Rosenstein signed at least one.
-The initial FISA application, plus the 3 renewals each provided the FBI and DOJ opportunities to present the FISC with all material and relevant facts pertaining to the case, which the two agencies repeatedly failed to do.
-They failed to disclose the DNC and Clinton campaign's role in funding Steele's efforts.
-They failed to name Fusion GPS as the group Steele was working for, instead presenting them as a ""named U.S. person"".
-Their initial FISA application cited a Yahoo News article to corraborate Steele's dossier, and falsely states that Steele did not provide any information to Yahoo News.
-The FBI terminated Steele as a source dut to collaborating with Mother Jones on October 30, 2016 (only 9 days after the FBI obtained their initial FISA order).
-The memo does not state when the FBI terminated Steele as a source, but it is likely they continued to use his dossier to extend their FISA order even after proving himself a less than reliable source.
-This is supported by the fact that Steele remained in contact with the DOJ even after he was terminated as a source.
-In his meetings with the DOJ, he admitted to strong anti-Trump bias that was not admitted to in any of the FISA applications (he admitted this before any of the FISA orders had been requested).
-His contact with the DOJ, Bruce Ohr, had a wife employed by Fusion GPS (like Steele), and was paid by the DNC and Clinton campaign (like Steele) for opposition research on Trump.
-The incestuous relationship between Steele's DOJ contact, Fusion GPS, and Steele was never shown to the FISC.
-A source validation report conducted by the FBI assessed Steele's reportings as minimally corroborated and Director Comey testified before Congress that the dossier was ""salacious and unverified"", but the FBI used and continued to use Steele's dossier to obtain FISA extensions.
-Without Steele's salacious, unverified, and minimally corroborated dossier, the FISA warrants and extensions would never have been obtained in the first place.",0.7906,515
