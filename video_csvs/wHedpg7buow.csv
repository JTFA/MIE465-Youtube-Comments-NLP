Its a distant future in which the earth is in constant war state and there are only 7 countries with expansionists politics. This war happens because of two alien races that escape their planet and established in the earth and enslaved humanity, but the conflicts between the two races got to an extreme point since some of the nutrients the Berserker alien race needed in order to survive wasn't available in earth and the only source of it was the other alien race name Mixtir. Because of this the Berserker start slaving the mixtir and using them as farm animals
 The country of Axoria, home to all free mixtir that oppose the slaving has too many citizens living in poverty and starvation and starts a plan to get ride of all the orphans and homeless people. This plan is stopped by the director of national defense that suggest a plan to use all street orphans as soldiers in a military academy that gives children access to food, education and a place to stay as long as they give military service. 
The protagonist is a young teen that accepts the contract and joins the military academy just to survive. There meets a few people he befriends and joins not just to survive the military missions and the  the other students, but also to bring down the director of the academy and take control of it by implanting a teacher they trust as the leader in a revolt. The objective its not only to do the revolt, but also to destroy the other empire that threatens the freedom of Axoria. 
The story has some Tolkien elements in the area of exploring since the character have to do missions in nature places and face weird creature of alien origin during their military missions. They fight with swords and guns that are more advanced that current ones.
Its basically the story of young kids who's faith was seal by others and sent to a war they never ask for and how this war changed them forever.  The characters are something similar to the middle of their teen years but since they are aliens the numbers are not the same. The novel its too dark for teens and it doesn't really has love as juvenile novel has, its more oriented for young adults.
 It would be publish on spanish, if it has enough commercial success it could be translated to English.",-0.8304,429
"+lasso Oftentimes the shit that happens on the other side of the world DOES affect you. But putting that aside, we're a globalized planet now. So much of the modern world is built on the exploitation, suffering, and ill treatment of poor vulnerable people that are forced to mine, grow, sew, and manufacture goods in exchange for the most meager of pay while we're able to enjoy luxuries they will never have a chance to. Not trying to be a hippie about this, but it's true, and we've built a global civilization that likes to keep that sort of thing outside the peripheral of the average citizen. Being aware of how you affect others is key. A problem with my pointing out this problem, though, is that we're stuck in a system that will continue unabated even if one entire nation decides it won't buy any products that are made off of such labor. As *long* as there are buyers it will continue. It would take something as catastrophic as, I don't know, the governments of those foreign nations outright banning any and all foreign corporations/businesses from employing their workers or setting up shop within their borders and we all know with how nationless corporations have become, that's pretty much impossible because there would be a chance you'd be banning someone from your own country from participating in a business that employees his own countrymen. 

If we were to say ""Alright, what is the cost of giving these people good pay and working conditions?"" I'd say it may simply be that corporations would have to pay more out of pocket and that would translate to rising prices in the products they end up selling because corporations, at the end of the day, want to see $$$. By design and modern definition, they don't care about anything but making shareholders money because CEOs and the like are legally contracted and obligated to make that money; if a CEO protests on moral or ethical grounds, they could get fired or sued and replaced by someone who has no such scruples.",-0.7387,387

"Although I love the outlook of this channel on many topics the lack of sociology seriously delimits some of the arguments made. Aside from it being a prestigious way of distracting ourselves from the anxieties of existence, news are not even what many would think of it as. By just looking at the small number of companies that owns media outlets, you get the idea that there is a huge monopoly going on about the 'truth' that is constructed for us. Not only would the news almost never challenge the present order but it'd also necessarily need to be close to the politically powerful as many times there are no alternative sources for 'last minute' news about political affairs. Aside from such media bias, news outlets also operate upon principles for keeping as many audiences as possible, constantly trying to entertain, surprise or horrify audiences, bending and mending news in that way, and never coming to talk about uncomfortable topics that could be use in understanding what is going on in society, unless there is political interest in exposing them. 

Although all of us can agree that we are seeking external sources to mask our anxiety of being human, this video does not even go to the depths of explaining why the news is such a good source for this, let alone how mistaken we are to regard it as the ultimate prestigious source of distraction...",-0.2315,256

Everything must come to an end eventually. But ignoring this very fact is going to make the chaotic transition period even worse. And that's exactly what the mainstream news is doing. Its ignoring the very end of our era, and all the symptoms that arise from this. We must become conscious of this fact. Our time of greatness here in the West is over. And we better acknowledge it. We must prepare to hold on to whatever we can take hold of. And then hope we won't wash away completely when the the great flood of time finally strikes.

Transsexuality and other obessions and confusions with personal identity. Mass sports events to sooth the underlying unrest. Cultural collapse and loss of traditions. Losing faith in the ruling class. New religions from beyond our borders creeping in. A sense of shame and guilt for the past. Enforced multiculturalism. Political and religious Utopian ideologies. A severe dislike of masculinity and an obsession with femininity. A great dislike for war and an impossible ideal for everlasting peace The attempt at making men and women equal in the political and social spheres, which will only make the gap bigger due to the amplification of biological and genetic differences.

Heritage foundation for conservative, Cato institute for libertarian and center for American progress for liberal/progressive. Hoover/Brookings is pretty good too. Hoover is slightly right leaning and Brookings is slightly left leaning generally speaking. 

As for news sites themselves there's a lot more liberal ones than conservative/libertarian, but I'd say for conservative the best is the dailywire (Ben Shapiro), Reason is pretty good for libertarian and liberal I hop around a lot, but  Washington Post or NYT for example.",0.9732,162

"Yes because most local news networks are controlled by corporate interests, try online for more varied news, like ""secular talk"" or ""democracy now"" looking at news from your countries enemies is the most interesting such as RT and Aljezeera, and for fuck sake stay away from ""Fox Views"" as it is just right wing propaganda.",0.1918,65

"it's certainly important to focus on one's individual life, it's also important to keep an eye out for possible dangers. 
If the flu is heavy in your area, you need to know so that you can get a flu shot. 
If you're black, and the police are jumpy with black people, you need to know so that you can exercise extra caution (and take the system to task). 
If a disease infects your food (Like mad cow disease in the mid 2000's) you need to know so that you can avoid that food. .
If an elected official does enacts a policy that will affect you negatively, you need to know so that you can vote against that person in the next election. 
That's the most important function of news. When it's doing it's job properly, the news can help you make informed decisions.",-0.743,162
