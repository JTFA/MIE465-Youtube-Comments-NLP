"Teeth didn't evole.  This is genetic scientific fraud;

Evolution is Mystic Myth - Dr. Wolfgang Smith _(a very smart german, typical)_, physicist and mathematics professor at Oregon State University, perceptively identifies Darwinism as a very old PAGAN RELIGION;

_""....As a (operational) scientific theory, Darwinism would have been jettisoned long ago. The point, however, is that the doctrine of evolution has swept the world, not on the strength of its scientific merits, but precisely in its capacity as a *Gnostic myth*. It affirms, in effect, that living things created themselves, which is in essence a metaphysical claim....Thus....evolutionism is a metaphysical doctrine decked out in (operational) scientific garb.....*it is a scientistic myth*. And the myth is Gnostic, because it implicitly denies the transcendent origin of being; for indeed, only after the living creature has been speculatively reduced to an aggregate of particles does Darwinist transformism become conceivable. Darwinism, therefore, continues the ancient Gnostic practice of deprecating ""God the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth."". It perpetuates....the venerable Gnostic tradition of 'God bashing.'""_ [From Old Gnosticism to New Age I, Alan Morrison, SCP Journal Vol, 28:4-29:1, 2005, pp. 30-31].  _(the more accurate word would be ""Mystic"" and ""Mysticism"" not ""Gnostic"" and ""Gnosticism"" since these two words came into english through faulty philological practice and thus the words are corrupted and really a misnomer and shouldn't be used with the english definition they've been given since the definitions are false having come from corrupted sources)_.",0.6408,322
