"Actually, Adam, The Lord has already saved by dying for us.
Most people don't believe this, but we have souls.
Science calls it energy, and once energy is created, it can't be destroyed.

This energy is actually sentient, it is our souls.

Jesus died, so that we can start over.
This Beautiful and Wonderful Gift is free, all you have to do it is receive it.
Receive it as a child. 
When you give a child something, they take it. 
They don't feel bad and try to repay you, they just *receive it*.

It sounds so simple, but the devil, who's already defeated, will make it something hard to grasp, and turn it into something far more complicated.

Your claims are actually a lie! 
Christianity is not dying, in fact, souls are continuing to be saved! HALLELUJAH!

My Jesus has already come, but He will be back very soon!",0.9872,182

"Praise God that everyone was okay!

The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!

Jesus loves you! He is not angry at you! He does not hate you, either! So stop believing the devil's lies. 

Jesus died and rose again for us, so that we may live!
Being a Christian doesn't mean your life will be free of trials and tribulations, but it means that you have your inheritance in Christ. Your new home is heaven, where there will be no more death, sorrows, or illness.

I share this message here, because I want you all to be partakers of this Awesome Gift we have been given freely by The Lord. 

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He will forgive you, He will redeem you, He will deliver you from your sins, He will make you new! Hallelujah!

He did for me, friends. I have literally seen and felt The Lord's Working Power! This is something I have seen with my own eyes! This is why I preach. 

The Lord will also save you from the oncoming judgement approaching this earth! He made a Way to escape it, by His Body on the cross. He took our punishment upon Himself. Thank You, Jesus!

So friends, Jesus is no doubt coming. The signs are here that He warned us about, but we might go to Him today, so this is why there is an urgency to share this Life-Saving Message of Jesus! It's dangerous to pass from this life before accepting Jesus' Sacrifice for us, because He is the Only Way to escape. 

Please make Jesus your Lord and Savior today by calling upon Him. You will be saved! No fancy prayer needed, just speak from your heart to Him and let Him know what you've heard and read about Him, and admit that you need His Help. He will listen, friends. He will help, and He will forgive you if you seek His Forgiveness. He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him! Thank You, Jesus!

Shalom!",0.9958,397
