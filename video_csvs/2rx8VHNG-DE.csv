At what cost do we move away from our basic values, a love for GOD, a love for family. A love for our great country. The United States of America.
To move from our true selves, a GOD fearing people, could cost our reputation. Before Man and GOD HIMSELF. May the good Lord who gave us, with great joy, the consitution of America guide us toward a tomorrow He would have us enjoy. Fear the evil that trys to move us from a love and a need for that CREATOR and the blessings only He may Grant as a bastion of liberty. May the GOD of Abraham be with us. As a Nation, a people, and GOD fearing families. At what cost? The GOD given soul. 
The final answer.
Don't be a fag.

LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE

""THIS SHAMEFUL FONT OF INDIFFERENTISM GIVES RISE TO THAT ABSURD AND ERRONEOUS PROPOSITION WHICH CLAIMS THAT LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE MUST BE MAINTAINED FOR EVERYONE. IT SPREADS RUIN IN SACRED AND CIVIL AFFAIRS, THOUGH SOME REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH THE GREATEST IMPUDENCE THAT SOME ADVANTAGE ACCRUES TO RELIGION FROM IT. ‚ÄòBUT THE DEATH OF THE SOUL IS WORSE THAN FREEDOM OF ERROR,' 


AS AUGUSTINE WAS WONT TO SAY. 


""WHEN ALL RESTRAINTS ARE REMOVED BY WHICH MEN ARE KEPT ON THE NARROW PATH OF TRUTH, THEIR NATURE, WHICH IS ALREADY INCLINED TO EVIL, PROPELS THEM TO RUIN. 

THEN TRULY ‚ÄòTHE BOTTOMLESS PIT' IS OPENED FROM WHICH JOHN SAW SMOKE ASCENDING WHICH OBSCURED THE SUN, AND OUT OF WHICH LOCUSTS FLEW FORTH TO DEVASTATE THE EARTH. THENCE COMES TRANSFORMATION OF MINDS, CORRUPTION OF YOUTHS, CONTEMPT OF SACRED THINGS AND HOLY LAWS--IN OTHER WORDS, A PESTILENCE MORE DEADLY TO THE STATE THAN ANY OTHER. EXPERIENCE SHOWS, EVEN FROM EARLIEST TIMES, THAT CITIES RENOWNED FOR WEALTH, DOMINION, AND GLORY PERISHED AS A RESULT OF THIS SINGLE EVIL, NAMELY IMMODERATE FREEDOM OF OPINION, LICENSE OF FREE SPEECH, AND DESIRE FOR NOVELTY.""
