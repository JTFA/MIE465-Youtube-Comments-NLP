He only pulled out of that deal bec he didn't want the bad publicity and bec he's a white guy getting money off black music. H&M is notorious for child labor and just shitty practices. In 2016 everyone knew that they employed 14 yr olds and had them working as hard as the adults.

it's funny he talks about the whole world being connected yet for some reason he wants to separate the difference between a black person and a white person by saying H&M put something out that's racist. The reality is H&M made an ad that had a hoodie that had a comment or reference on it to children they had nothing to do with race but since it was a black kid modeling the hoodie him and a few other people decided to scream racism. because companies that are trying to make as much money as they can are all about screwing over one group of people that's going to impact their business it makes so much sense. obviously the substances he's on are affecting the way he thinks. as for myself I agree with the mom of the model in that it was just a reference to Children acting like monkeys which children do and had nothing to do with color skin or race. what's crazy is nobody would be up in arms about that H&M thing if it was a white kid or Asian kid in the hoodie but the people that were not screaming racism like myself or people that realize we're all human beings were all children of God and we're not different because we have different colored skin or different ethnicities.,-0.8259,237
