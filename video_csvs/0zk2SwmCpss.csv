"Dan McGuckin 1st of all you are fuqqing delusional if you think that ive never watched a sixers game. Ive been watching the sixers since I was born you idiot, but it seems like you need to watch some sixers games & actually see how Jahlil Okafor actually plays because it seems like you & alot of delusional idiots like you arent watching the same game that I am. The guy is a natural in the post & has great on ball moves & touch for a power foward. You people make him out to be a scrub just because he doesnt hustle hard enough? Are we trying to win a championship, or are we doing boot camp tryouts? Last time ive known the rules of basketball it was you have to score the most points to win, & thats what Okafor does! The guy is a walking 20 & 10 & can easily come off the bench! When was the last time Rashaun Holmes scored anywhere close to 20 points in a game? Rashaun Holmes is too small to be a power foward. Hes build like a small foward but cant play as a stretch because he cant shoot. He may can do all the dirty plays but the 2nd unit still needs scoring on the offensive end & to have an automatic post scorer on yr team & can have him come off the bench, but not even use him at all is absolutely idiotic If Okafor is this bad then why is he still on the fuqqin team? Why does he only play when Embiid is out? *But trading Noel still made sense though right?* IMBECILES!",0.9749,299

You say you actually watch the game, but in the same paragraph deliver irrelevant stats about the game you're watchin 😂 +/- ratio? Are you kidding me? Do you realize the sixers have been the worse team in the league for the past 6 years? *with or without Okafor* so whether the team is losing while hes on the floor or not essentially means absolutely nothing because you cant pin that on 1 player. Also you still havent answered my questions on how Okafor is still on the team if hes so bad & Noel isnt. Noel is the complete opposite of Okafor & meshed well with the sixers entirely, so why is Okafor still here & not Noel? Shows you that being a system guy & hustling hard isnt the issue here, so stop giving that lame excuse about Okafor. The guy isnt that bad of a player & could probably be a top 5 power forward if he actually could play a year straight on a team that isnt full of scrubs. *Now would be a good time* but do they do that?

You’re getting heated for no reason Bruh.",0.8433,117
"KZ1994able Richaun* Holmes is 6'10, how is that too small for a PF? He isn't a great 3-point shooter, but is better than Jah in that regard, who can't stretch the floor at all and Holmes did have three 20+pts games last season. Also Jahlil is a center not a pf, he has always played at C. Obviously we are trying to win a championship, but defense wins championships and that is Jah biggest flaw. 
Noel's situation is pretty obvious if have some nba-contract knowledge, it was the final year of his rookie contract and Noel was looking to sign a big contract, a max contract in fact, as he even turned down 70mil for 4 years by the mavs. We weren't looking to pay that much money for a bench player, who also is limited on offense.
Also you say that you watch the sixers and are a fan of them, but you get players names wrong, don't even really know our rotations, our playstyle or that we started tanking in 2013/14 and made the playoffs 6 years ago.",0.9791,206
KZ1994able and Noel was definitely not worth he max if he was going to be primarily used as just the backup big especially since Richaun Holmes did the same thing as Noel with a little more range. And sure Noel did have some great games and was the star on some nights but that’s cause they literally didn’t have anybody else. He couldn’t handle the load himself. You see how he acted in free agency? He really thought he was worth the max and declined a contract the Mavs offered which payed him pretty well and now he’s only makin 4.1 mil for one season. Hes fell out of rotation now too.,0.9354,126
"KZ1994able dawg he’s 6’10. What the hell are you talking about. Most power forwards in the league are around that size. Davis is 6’11, Blake is 6’10, Millsap 6’9, Ibaka, Aaron Gordon is that tall I can go on. So Saric isn’t lacking size. And Okafor you want Okafor running around chasing these stretch fours now with his lack of mobility? And offensively he doesn’t fit in with Embiid at all. It doesn’t work like that anymore. They even tried it for some stretches last season and it wasn’t successful at all. When you have a player like Embiid, you surround him with shooters because of the attention he draws. And there is no skill set set for power forward and centers now. It’s how they complement each other’s game and Okafor’s back to basket play doesn’t complement Embiid’s skill set. And as a bench player he doesn’t fit in with the way they play. I can go all day with this big you want to. I do agree he needs to get traded however.",0.7783,225
"KZ1994able dude you are literally retarded. You’re not even a Sixers fan. Okafor has had so many chances the last two years. He is so disengaged on defense. He’s useless in the open floor. He’s a ball stopping offensive player. None of those things help us in anyway. We lose to pass the ball. We’re second in the league to only Golden State in assists per game. We love to get out and run. And Brett preaches defense. He literally is the opposite of a fit here. Stop looking at stats and highlights. I guarantee you’ve never sat down and watched a Sixers game. As for the second unit, Richaun Holmes (who was out last night) is usually that guy. He’s immediate energy. He’s still working on becoming a complete defender, but he’s a very good shot blocker. He moves well offensively and he’s athletic and so he can run the floor. Okafor doesn’t fit here dude. He doesn’t fit anywhere. That’s the reason we can’t trade him. Sure, teams are interested but they don’t wanna give anything up. The dude is not a good NBA player",0.9601,242
"KZ1994able holy fuck you’re dumb. You lost me when you called Jah a power forward lol. It’s about scoring points but when Jah is on the floor the other team scores more points😂😂 you literally make your own points invalid. Jah has one of the worst +/- ratings in NBA history. So again, don’t come at me telling me I’m watching the wrong guy. You seriously don’t understand the game of basketball if you think it’s all about points",-0.9432,101
"KZ1994able just cause you think it’ll that it will. We’ve seen these past few years it hasn’t worked. I don’t understand your point. The Sixers simply don’t need him at all. With their players they don’t have long stretches or stretches at all where either Ben, Joel, Roco, JJ or Dario aren’t in to be the scorers. Not to mention they have Markelle rehabbing back into shape. Just because he’s a good scorer doesn’t mean he’s going to actually help the team more than really slow it down. Their backup big men in Amir and Richaun fill the role the Sixers need. They screen and roll and have the ability to stretch the floor if needed. Plus they just need some big guys that can move around defensively with the way the NBA is changing now. Okafor doesn’t fit in that role.",0.8893,178

"KidKiko 1st of all I never said that Saric was too small I said Holmes. 2nd of all tell me how many games did Embiid play with Okafor last year. Im pretty sure it was less than 10. What duo do you know that can develop chemistry in 10 games? Okafor has never been givin a chance to play on a full squad cause hes always used as a filler for Embiid in garbage time with a sh!tty team that is tanking! So again how the hell you know what he can do with Embiid? 3rd off, once again I said the guy can easily come off the bench & fill in for the center or power forward position & be instant offense. I mean you pretty much know he wants to leave after the way hes been treated, but while hes still here they might as well use em! Everything you're saying is stupid idiology & doesnt make sense with the talent Okafor posesses. You keep harping on all his negatives when his positives out weigh his negatives & his negatives can be fixed overtime with good coaching & work ethic on his behalf. Kyle Korver dont do sh!t on the Cavs but shoot 3s & hes out there every night, meanwhile Okafor is a big man whos a natural scorer in the post & when engaged has the size to rebound, block, & could also potentially call for the double team to pass out for the assist. You've seen what he could do in college now you have to give him a chance to show what he can do in the pros, but ull never know if he doesnt play. Im pretty sure the Celtics would love an Okafor for sum extra scoring to keep the pressure off Horford. Keep acting like Okafor is a scrub & hes gonna join a rival & bite the sixers in the ass, but it shouldnt even have to come down to that if they just play the man.",0.9839,362
"KidKiko Noel isnt worth a max? If you look at the sixers games last year before he got traded he was coming into his own with this team & was damn near the star on some nights. The sixers have plenty of money to pass around, so money shouldnt have been an issue to keep him after what he was showing out there on the floor. Imagine having Okafor & Noel coming off the bench as yr backups, or even Okafor & Saric. The team would be scary, but ok they dont want to pay Noel i get it, but it doesnt explain why Okafor is still here & not being used. How do you expect to get any player for Okafor if you're not putting the guy in a position where he can showcase his skill? Everytime hes out there the sixers have no shot of winning & is pretty much just a garbage time filler & now that the sixers are good they dont use him at all. *THAT MAKES NO DAMN SENSE* The guy can average 20 & 10 in his sleep, but you cant go out there & play yr game if yr team is holding you out this much. The guy was a 3rd overall pick & he hasnt played consistantly as much for people to be judging his game the way that they are. You need to just admit that the sixers are just using him wrong & stop trying to degrade him. That is the big flaw in this process.",-0.8118,275

So again you coming on his highlights trying to act like he sucks and can only produce against the clippers is sheer fallacy. The +30pts &+10rbds is the usual Embiid and not the other way around.

I don't think he was a lottery pick either he was a late 1st round or 2nd round pick right? So don't expect much from him. It is good that he is still in the NBA becoming an OK role player.

On the other hand, Joel without injuries was predicted to be an absolute number 1 pick far surpassing Wiggins who was clearly a hell of a player in terms of potential & talent; could be a number 1 pick in most drafts in recent years. So it is not surprising.",0.2516,122

blues watchin of course the defending champs who are the team to beat in the west are going to beat a young team who has barely played together on there home court.

"dude, you missed my point, my disappointment was not with the 76 sixers, it was with the CLIPPERS, the more experienced team... 

 But I will say and not only I but others as well, the young center seems fragile and injury prone and for that reason, they are being careful with him. IF he can stay healthy, and not turn into a Rose, he will be a very good player, for sure...  

To finish my point, as young as the Sixers are they have already surpassed the Clippers at this early stage.  I told my buddies over 6yrs ago, the Clipper would not WIN with DJ and Blake.  It was a bad decision by Doc, to keep both and by doing so both players may never reach their potential...  It's time to move on from Doc and let Jerry West take over the Clippers.  When I watch this game, I was shaking my head at how BAD THE CLIPPERS looked, not how GREAT you or any thought the Sixers were.",-0.9638,192

john giang the sixer are gonna make the playoffs this year......why are you hung up on okafor? clearly embiid is leaps and bounds better than him.  the sixers are gonna be juggernauts in the future. fultz simmons saric embiid covington is such a  legit lineup.  I would say that the sixers were successful in building a pretty damn good team.  honestly they have a much better chance to win the championship in the future than toronto....,0.9786,84
johnnyfuckboy   You're an idiot. You are basing someone's skill on whether they are being traded for or not???? How do you know what goes on behind the scenes about talks between teams?

okafors first year he was a solid one dimensional player. he can easily score 20-30 a night but grab you 2 to 3 rbds a night and be the joke of the league on defense. So flat footed and plays with no energy !! this is coming from a big time okafor fan who watches all sixers game but unfortunately i have no good news for him. his career might be over in the nba . had he been athletic and played some kind of defense him and embiid would have been a dream twin towers combo !!!,0.9461,104

His size is his issue & he can easily be tooken advantage of. I like the guy & hes a good bench player, but he cant score consistantly like Okafor can, so I dont understand why Okafor is sitting out & Holmes isnt. And I know that Okafor is *listed* as a center clown. Im talking in the way the sixers *should* use these players, not the way they're using them right now. Okafor's size & skill screams of a power forward & it would be beneficial to the team if he played that position with an Embiid at center. So dont get smart with me my dude I know what the fuq im talking about.",0.8409,173
