"Actually, her formula for writing songs is largely based on 'the greats' and they actually tell a story like old country did as well, as opposed to the modern pop country (which is typically what people mean when they say 'i don't like country'). You can tell she has an old soul, especially if you listen to her other projects.",0.7269,71

"Dear brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ loves you so much. He desires to have a close and personal relationship with you. Will you accept Him and give your life to Him this very moment? In closeness with Jesus you are safe. In the intimacy of His presence you are energized. No matter where you are in the world, you know you belong when you sense Jesus Christ is near. Ever since the Fall, man has experienced a gaping emptiness that only Jesus presence can fill. You were designed for close communication with our Creator Father God. Father God enjoyed walking in the garden with Adam and Eve, before the evil 
one deceived them!                                                                                                                        

When you commute with Jesus in the garden of your heart, both you and Jesus are blessed. This is His way of living in the world---through you! Together we all can push back the darkness, with Jesus Christ whom dwells with us for He is the light of the world. Believe in Jesus Christ, accept what He did on the cross for the sins of mankind. Ask our Lord and Savior to forgive you of your sins, study The Living Word in the Christian based Holy Bible. Allow yourself to be water baptized, washed clean and made anew by His precious blood. Welcome the Holy Spirit into your whole being. It will be the greatest decision you will ever make.❤️❤️❤️ (Psalm 32:7;  Genesis 3:8-9; John 3:16; John 8:12)",0.979,280

"The people in these comments "" I don't even like country music"" lol this is barely country music. Unless this is what country passes for nowadays which is kinda weird. Either way it is a good song. I suggest listening to some ""country country"" songs from Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris K, Merle Haggard, Hank Williams, George Jones to name a few.",0.491,77

"🦋I was just coasting, never really going anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was getting kind of use to staying there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, hmm
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color, makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt, 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart, 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, hmm
You give me butterflies

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
Taking my hand, 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, hmm
You give me butterflies🦋",-0.4588,281
