My friends, The Lord Jesus Christ is coming. 

The Lord LOVES you. 

The Word says in John 3:16 (paraphrased) that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. 

So friends, Jesus is not angry at you and neither does He hate you. 

The Lord came down in the Person of Jesus Christ to die, and 3 days later, rise again for all of us. 

He redeemed us! Hallelujah!

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He will forgive you, He will make you new, and He will deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

Jesus already took our punishment, all you need to do is accept it by mustard seed faith. You don't need a fancy prayer to make Jesus your Lord and Savior, just speak from the heart. 

All those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

Shalom!",0.9892,202
