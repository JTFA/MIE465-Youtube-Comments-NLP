"I grew up with a brother who has autism. He had a really difficult time as a child and to him, the world was a really complicated and scary place. He wouldn't speak to strangers, would have a melt down if his routine would change even slightly and no one really saw him having much of a future. He grew up to be one of the smartest and nicest people I know, and now is working in his dream job as a TV producer. This is down to unwavering support of our parents and the fantastic resources available to my brother as he was growing up. To think that a child with autism who has incredible potential may not have access to those resources absolutely breaks my heart. The show may not have been perfect, but it raises a lot of money and bought awareness for autism and highlighted the amazing work people are doing to help. The gentleman working with the police to make sure they are more aware? That's awesome!  Tommy Hilfiger designing the autism friendly clothing? That's cool. Good work guys, and thank you for your support and ideas.",0.9895,209

"I'm the mother of a child with autism.  Last year our daughter was taken away from us by stupid, ignorant police who were like 21 years old, never had children of their own and didn't know jack about autism.  My husband and I were arrested.  We spent our last penny on posting bail and hiring a lawyer.  The CPS caseworker even has tried to get the DA to drop the charges, which are absolutely made up.  I just want to bring awareness that ourselves and so many other parents of autistic children are going through the same or similar nightmares.  Society and the police need to learn about autism and stop needlessly taking autistic children out of loving homes, just because they don't understand that our kids may act different from what they're used to.  Less than 3 months after taking our daughter away, she lost 26 pounds and suffered from failure to thrive.  We were only allowed to see her 2 times a month.  This was harming her more than anything they were accusing us of.  It's been over a year since they took her and we're still fighting to get her back.  This whole ordeal has drained us of all our money, and even if we were to get her back tomorrow, we would have an even harder time trying to care for her now that we have no money.  I believe they know they screwed up, but they won't admit to it.",-0.9285,266

The white people then were like angles, and when color T.V came the women with their red nails and lipstick and golden brown skin was a rare sight. and then there was the pristine neighborhoods with houses that had unfortified windows the size of walls.
