"There is nothing interesting about Pizza that you go name your band on it. i believe the Olsen twins also did a music video themed on pizza. The reason is it's not about pizza that we all love to eat. It's pedophilia code. The FBI has a list of code words used by pedophiles just like there are code names for drugs. The podesta emails shinned a huge light on this with tons of references to many of these code words like pizza, hot dog, walnut, and others I can't think of. Every since these emails came out, Hillary and her crew went into full out distraction mode. That is when they started blaming Russia for hacking her emails. Even if that were true (which it was not) that does not take away from the content in those emails. She played the whole attack the messenger and ignore the message routine. Those Pizza places in D.C that had pedophilia symbols on their signs and menus and disgusting musical acts that they advertised for all ages are without a doubt pedophiles. The Instagram page of James Alachild lover was full of disgusting pictures can just cannot be ignored. They had pictures of young children and babies in inappropriate settings. The email about a pool party with a 7 year old, 11 year old and another underage child said they were going to be there for the adults entertainment. The artwork of the Podestas is loaded with underage girls.. It is mind boggling that the whole country is not getting together and bringing these people to justice. Every month there is a different protest to distract people from pizza gate and the mainstream media like usual called it a crazy conspiracy theory. No investigation was done and they put a quick stop to people investigating by setting up a false flag where a guy with a gun went into comet ping pong with a gun because of what he read on the internet about the place. It was actually predicted before it happened that they would do something like that to stop people from investigating these pedo front businesses. There are so many connections its amazing. There is even a phone call between a you tuber and James A'lefantis (I believe it means little boy lover in french) where James threatens the life of this kid and his girl friend. All of this information is out there for anyone to look into but people are too busy fighting with each other over whatever government setup protest is going on month to month. We have a bunch of Satanic, child abusing, molesting, sacrificing, and child trafficking mother fuckers all throughout governments around the world and within Hollywood. This is real and everyone wants to block it out and pretend it is not a widespread problem. Many you tubers that kept up the coverage and investigation into these things received crazy death threats. Nobody realizes that this global elite pedophile and child trafficking ring is enough to collapse governments around the world if people finally wake up to what they have been doing to the most helpless and innocent people in the world.... OUR CHILDREN! Look how many times Bill Clinton took a ride on the lolita express to go to his convicted child molesting buddy Jeffrey Epstein. There are many other high profile people that have been to orgy island where underage children are served up to these filthy animals.",-0.9929,621
