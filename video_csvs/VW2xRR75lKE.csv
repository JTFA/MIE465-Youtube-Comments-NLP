"Hello!!!! Guys!!! 
https://youtu.be/11SXa92_h1Y
In this video I am going to explain a rare lunar event being termed as""SUPER BLUE BLOOD MOON""



LETS GET STARTED...





A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes within Earth's umbra (shadow). As the eclipse begins, Earth's shadow first darkens the Moon slightly. Then, the shadow begins to ""cover"" part of the Moon, turning it a dark red-brown color (typically – the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions). The Moon appears to be reddish because of Rayleigh scattering (the same effect that causes sunsets to appear reddish) and the refraction of that light by Earth's atmosphere into its umbra.[2]

The following simulation shows the approximate appearance of the Moon passing through Earth's shadow. The northern portion of the Moon is closest to the center of the shadow, making it darkest, and most red in appearance.



The Pacific Ocean will be turned toward the moon at the time of the eclipse. Central and eastern Asia (including most of Siberia), Philippines, Indonesia, New Zealand and most of Australia will get a fine view of this moon show in the evening sky. Heading farther west into western Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, the eclipse will already be underway as the moon rises

The shade at night is hotter than the moonlight, you can test this yourself, thus moonlight must be cold. How can you explain that away?
The Moon, therefore, MUST be shining its own light, logically, because, if it were reflecting the Sun's light, the temperature comparison between light and shade would be the same as in the day. The moonlight (actually reflected sunlight) would be hotter than in the shade. But this is not observed; the opposite is actually true. So the Moon cannot be reflecting the Sun's light.",0.4871,142

I have a doubt.  Blue component of light should refract more than red component.  So the blue light should bend more and the umbra region shoould be blue.  But in this video blue light is not refracted instead red is refracted.  Why is it so?,-0.3612,50

That right there is the only proof anyone should need that there is no curvature. If the Earth were globular, the Chicago skyline should be obscured. But it isn't. Where's the curve?

I'm done talking to you; as I already said, this conversation isn't going anywhere, and you're becoming very annoying. But I will leave you with this - everything NASA (and all 'space agencies') put out is obviously fake if you look at it critically for just a moment https://ronmamita.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1-nasa-america-size-changes-with-the-seasons-orbital-photo.jpg?w=918&h=718 and all so-called 'proofs' of a globular Earth in transit through 'Outer Space' (which doesn't exist) are pseudoscientific and easily debunked, whereas the proofs for a flat, motionless Earth are resplendent. 

In closing, and just to enrage you even more, I believe that dinosaurs never existed, Macroevolution is a lie, the Holocaust never happened, and every terrorist attack and shooting you see on the news and believe in is fabricated, too. I genuinely tried to help out and teach people a thing or two, but I won't be responding anymore. Have a good day.",-0.6002,208

Clearly this conversation isn't going anywhere in the way of convincing the other person. Are you done replying yet?",0.7131,33
