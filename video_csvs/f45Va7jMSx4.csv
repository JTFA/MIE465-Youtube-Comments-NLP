"Pecos Pete - my father would have strongly agreed. He regularly applied the strop. As in a thick leather razor strop. On the upside we didn't get the burning skin welts that occurred when he couldn't find where we occassionally hid the strop and he reverted to using a regular waist belt, but on the downside that thick, heavy strop left deep bruising (he seemed to like really putting his arm into it) which meant it was painful to sit down for _days_ . The main problem with this is that when he was four sheets to the wind (which was every other day) he tended to get really angry and paranoid, and used to think we were giving him disrespectful looks when we were usually trying to quietly keep out of his way, which meant he would decide we needed a belting whenever he felt like it. This childhood home environment left one of my siblings with anger and control issues that has given her serious difficulties in keeping her own marriage together, and another sibling with what was thought to be a basic social anxiety issue early in adulthood but which was diagnosed as PTSD in later years.

Yep, PTSD.

But still, since our dad made regular applications of disciplinary belting we were obviously not raised by some 'snowflake libtard', so we must've all turned out ok in the end, ey.",-0.9175,255
Pecos Pete lol I got spankings when I was a kid because I never listened to what my parents said. The spankings never traumatized me or made me a bad person because now I'm a normal working member of society. My parents stopped giving me spankings when I became a teenager but I remember that my parents always talked to me and told me why I was getting a spanking and it made it easier to learn from my mistakes. I don't believe all kids should get spankings though because some kids will listen if you just talk to them.,0.2451,104
