"As someone who rarely ever uses makeup i honestly find it silly how other girls just buys tones of makeup just cos... it's such a waste... and because they go so heavy with makeup they end up using it so quickly but i don't at all... i have makeup i've had for ages now mainly some eyeshadows mostly cheap cream or cream/powder ones and although the smell gets stronger they still work and there is nout wrong with them, i have 1 palette that is a powder eyeshadow too and a fushia metalic stick lipstick that also acts as a lip stain too that were super popular and i have some left and it's still obsolotely fine nout wrong with it, if less is used then makeup can last you ages.",0.8126,139

I love the shop your stash idea and recreating palettes with what you already have. Especially when you're a casual makeup enthusiast. If you're looking for something new, one thing that I'd love to see (which I don't think you've done before) is you using indie duochromes. (from Fyrinnae for example like mephisto) They are some of the coolest shades I've ever seen, but because they're pigments, they're a little more difficult to work with.

This is amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®,0.6239,13
"This is precisely why we love you so much. While all the others are still pushing the endless array of new products you are quietly, beautifully and elegantly saying ‚Äúmake do‚Äù. It can be so tiresome being interested in makeup but hearing buy buy buy every time I want to learn a bit more. So thank you from the bottom of my very grateful ‚ù§Ô∏è üòò",0.9507,73
"This is so refreshing! I would love to see more of this kind of video! There is more time spent instructing on how to apply the make up, and general information due to not telling us about the actual product. Love it",0.882,46
"This is such a good video, especially from somebody who is super qualified and experienced, but not totally immersed in the consumerism which must be tempting in the make up industry. Really, really love it.",0.9013,40
"This reminds me of the ""shop my stash"" videos, which I love!",0.6696,16
This video is awesome!!,0.6892,6
This video is so refreshing.  Thank you for focusing on the technique NOT the products.  I completely agree that I am over-saturated with consumerism at the moment.  I have some pretty pricey items in my collection and they need love!,0.9226,44
This was SO refreshing. Thank you! <3,0.7695,9

"Totally agree that there are far too many products out there but the Youtube beauty community has to take at least some of the responsibility for that. It's become 'normal' now to see Youtubers, not even just within the beauty community, showing off drawers and drawers of products, most of which they haven't paid for. It sets up an insecurity in the viewer that they don't have 'enough' and they will end up over-buying and having a foundation graveyard of shades that are wrong or piles of lipsticks bought off a Youtube recommendation from someone with a completely different skin tone. It's too much. Its become consumption for its own sake. But those in the industry have a vested interest in keeping us from ever being satisfied with what we've got as that would mean loss of profits for them. And whilst I love make-up and looking good it nevertheless doesn't feel much like progress when I see the endless videos of girls in their bedrooms playing with eyeshadow and hoping to be the next Zoella. Is that really the route to self-confidence?",0.9845,198
"Totally agree! Much needed video, Lisa! Tired of all the gurus urging us to buy the latest wonder product and then I cannot really tell the difference between the new product and the good old lovey... Good classics live 4 ever (as long as they are not discontinued...) Congrats dear Lisa!",0.3837,59
U are so right !! I just love your work üíïüíïüíï,0.6988,14
Using that Chanel palette everyday!!! Bought it after the video you made so 4 years ago and still love it!‚ù§Ô∏è,0.7482,26
"Very good point, I feel overwhelmed with all the make up choices. I don't buy as much as I used to, but I find that most of the time I go back to my old favourites anyway. Good video :)",0.8764,44
"Very refreshing video, i needed this.",0.0,8
"We need more videos like this, consumerism is becoming too much. Us regular people don‚Äôt buy new makeup all the time. Thank you Lisa.",0.6461,30
What a fabulous idea! I am sick of hauls and new product reviews and would rather learn more about good techniques and makeup trends. I also hope to see more natural makeup looks that I can actually pull off. I hope other Youtubers take your lead.,0.9035,50
"What a fantastic video, luved this!! XOXO Sharon",0.8968,11
"What a refreshing message! Thank you, Lisa. I'm a regular makeup user (not a professional) and I too have been feeling so overwhelmed by all the ""latest and greatest."" Much love! üíï",0.8556,41
"What a wonderful tutorial! This is why I love you Lisa, you speak to us like a normal people with a normal budget. Instead of feeling like I need to run out and buy a new lipstick or product you've made me think about the products I already own and (definitely!) need to explore more!",0.9357,62

"When you reach a certain point, the thrill and happiness from buying new products only last shorter and shorter. I find this really sad.",0.6003,27
"Wonderful video! I love watching makeup videos to see what's new, but I rarely actually buy makeup. 

I am not a trendy person, preferring more classic looks, I find a good neutral palette for my eyes is enough. I do ""splurge"" on lipsticks (I have 4 üòÜ). 

I have hit a point with makeup where I replace products as needed, but rarely add to what I own.",0.8439,80
Would be great !,0.6588,4
Yes this is my fave make up video :),0.8225,9
"Yes! Yes! I stopped buying stuff, I stopped my ipsy subscription. It got to a point in where I could use the same palette everyday and have different looks. So, I just stopped that crazy trend of wanting everything. Especially now that I found products that work great on me",0.6103,57
"Yesssss, I LOVE this! I have enough makeup to last me 38782394 years, and I am not a MUA or aspire to be one or anything like that. I'm on an indefinite #nobuy, and it is so hard, so I really appreciate video's like this!!! Thank you :)",0.9606,58
You are always such an inspiration! I look up to you and your skills so much; you are timeless and classy and knowledgeable. Thank you for a refreshing outlook going against the grain of addictive consumerism. <3,0.8999,41
You are are such a role model for the beauty community. Enjoy every video you have ever put out !!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,0.8469,25
You are the best Lisa. Simply the best!üíû,0.6696,11

You can't wear them all at the same time. You just pick the ones you like.,0.3612,18
You're beautiful,0.5994,2
"Your video is just right in time! This January I've decided to focus on some products just to finish them finally and I realised that I have sooooo many makeup which I use once or twice a year (in a best case), so even if not concidering marketing and consumerism, even, even then what I wasted my money for? And my time, choosing, waiting in the line etc. So, yes, value what you have and try to take maximum of it",0.7884,93
"i am sure so many people with a dermatological problem, a scar, maybe a facial deformity, or less eyelashes and eyebrows due to a medical condition etc. have benefited from your videos. so i believe it's important that you share your knowledge and experience. Yet I think, even the products you use in this video is 'overwhelming', too much to have for a daily look. Less is more, less is more, less is more:) You can change the perception of people from a 'beautifying' make-up look that requires lots of products, to a healthy and truely beautiful look that interfere less with nature and animals. I would love to see you making videos for example with less brushes, less concealing and using even less products. for example, it would be nice to see a video with only vegan products.

"i can easily say, i am not one of the people that always buy newest makeup. (i rarely wear them anyway) and even if i do, i always stick to the same color palette. i need things to be quick and easy. thus i prefer to buy staple products only (unless for foundation, as we all know base makeup takes time. especially if your skin is as sensitive as mine) but i adore the value of this video. and it is definitely true that alot of palettes that came out these days, all pretty much have the same tones. and it is so happy for me to see such person like you to remind us, that staple products are what we all need, not the newest one.  (Ps : Lisa's subscribers if any of you have really sensitive skin, mind sharing some of your base makeup?)",0.9897,167

"yes somebody with a following said it. powders don't go bad after a couple of years. that's why I buy only a couple of foundations or mascaras at the time but I have 30 powder blushes. also the setting powders , I think once you found the one that works well for you just stick with it. it's just powder.",0.6625,65
you are truly amazing!,0.7901,5
"~ Lovely Lisa, I adore your approach to makeup :)  So glad you never cake on the base or overdo the brows or highlighter, etc.!  Your makeup looks are always beautiful and your personality and voice are wonderfully soothing :)  You're one of my favourite YouTubers!  Your skin looks amazing and, in this video, you mentioned that you use a ""facial toning machine"" - Please tell us more!  What is it called?  Best wishes from Brighton xxxx",0.9903,88
