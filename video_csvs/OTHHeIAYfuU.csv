"MGMT has 2 maybe 3 good songs and the people I'm seeing like this album are prolly in high school and haven't found actual music yet, let alone good music. Very shitty attempt at 80s, very overcooked and unseasoned. You're just releasing what Tame Impala basically perfected with currents but tame impala had tenfold variations, meaning, feeling, and depth. I get that there is music for any time but there is so much ""80""s rip off shit not that this song is anywhere near an 80s vibe to anyone who knows 80s music. Just look up Brett. It's such a better tone, mood and atmospheric vibe that you sink into. California nights and glass hearts.
