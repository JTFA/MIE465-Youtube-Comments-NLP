GnuHopper I think it’s because without her glasses her X-ray Vison will act up in season one her adoptive dad gave her special glasses and said these will help with your X-ray. That’s what I think,0.6597,41

"No, it's just a disguise -the same reason Clark wears them. As adults, the Kryptonians have no problem controlling their powers, if they did then she'd still have to wear special glasses as Supergirl, too!",-0.69,42
"Ok, since Kara is on an alternate Earth where she doesn't have to worry about giving away her secret identity -- why does she bother wearing her glasses?",0.5583,31
"Peslac Bill well, yes and no. When he said there are 52 earths, he chose his words poorly. Yes there are, and there are presumably 52 Karas, but he really meant how many there are in the multiverse. Let’s not get into the fact that multiverse theory postulates an infinite - or vast amount - of earths, certainly a lot more than 52. 

However drilling down to my point, he meant there is a Kara in all the universes, but not necessarily on earth. Maybe a Kara died with krypton exploding, or maybe a universe where krypton didn’t explode. He just meant there are as many of each of them as there are universes. That’s my take on it. So, bottom line, it’s perfectly reasonable that there is not a Kara on earth in their world - which makes sense since they’d never heard of either her or Superman.",0.7684,178
