It is a fine balancing act to find the proper length of poppet and spring to achieve maximum pressurization and expansion before exhaust. The exhaust ports on the front of the engine are actually anti-thrust so maybe an exhaust shroud would help. Screw threads inside the rod bearings are creating a lot of friction and wear.

It was the fastest of all my toy cars!

I believe modern Jet passenger planes have adopted this technology over the past 20 years, Airbus A380 for example.

I just don't believe anyone noticed, and that onboard kerosene generators create compressed air which drives the jet turbines.

Crazy?! Consider the fuel amount, 330,000 litres, or 8 large fuel tankers...

Now do the maths and logistics and wonder why you can't smell jet fuel at airports anymore, and why there's these pesky white vapour trails Chris crossing our skies.

Take an empty 250ml water bottle, put cap on, twist it so it bulges in 2 parts, keep twisting it won't break, twist and twist until it's at bursting point. Then whilst you're still applying pressure, release the cap.

You've just compressed air using mechanical energy and created a vapour trail due to the temperature difference. A small one, but clearly visible.

Balance - flywheels are commonly fly-cut to improve the dynamic balance.  You are losing a lot of power to vibration from the unbalanced engine.  (Dynamic balance is a pretty tricky equation to solve, particularly for a single cylinder engine.  A metal flywheel would help smooth out the engine but you can't 3-D print that.)

"Yes, indeed a regulator might not be worthwhile and the elegance of a simple ball valve is compelling. I think that, considering the small volume of air in the bottle, it would help not to waist it all in one go. Keeping also in mind that all leaks after the regulator will be proportional to whatever pressure it regulates, it would also help reduce leaks.
I think I understood your strategy with another ball valve chamber, delivering predefined packets of pressured air to each stroke, but perhaps a typical spring actuated cone valve regulator would use the same resources and would make for a very interesting 3D printed project (I have no idea such a project is viable).
Regarding the air wasted around  the piston, maybe an o-ring on it would help, if the cylinder wall is smooth enough. Maybe use a copper/brass tube as a cylinder wall would make it smooth enough.",0.6022,171
