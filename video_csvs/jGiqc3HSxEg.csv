"I donno about this video. And I love your videos. 
But I think there is a huge difference between Sorkin, Wes Anderson, sharknado, and the room. To the extent that each one of these could have a video about their styles. 

Sorkin, shouldn't have even been on this list. It's not campy to BE parodied. Nobody would call rebel without a cause campy. And it's parodied a lot. 

Wes Anderson is more of a dry humor. But he does add campy elements in the same way the Coens do in films like Burn After Reading 

Sharknado isn't ""so bad it's good "" it is purposefully a parody of disaster films and purposefully is awful. He is consciously attempting ""so bad its good""  and instead making an absurd ridiculous film that is only funny in its excess. 

The room/birdemic/troll 2, those are ""so bad it's good"" in cases like troll 2 it was the dialogue because dude couldn't speak English. And it showed in the writing from his wife. As well as a really bad screenplay and music. But he thought it was art(and it is in its own right)  The room had the same awful script and writing. And wiseau has a very odd presence. It's like an alien trying to create a drama about earthlings with the audience knowing it was written by aliens. Lol. 

A good example of campy is evil dead. A good example of so bad its good is Troll 2",0.9879,281

"Now come on.  Pirates of the Caribbean would have been a good movie even without Jack Sparrow.  Every character in the film is a comedic parody of action cliches.  You can argue Jack Sparrow actually broke what they were going for (which was the same as Princess Bride).  But Sparrow was so good that no one minded that he was a self-aware chaotic neutral in a movie where everyone else was playing their stock role very straight.

As for me, my ultimate example of this effect is Judge Dredd.  The Sylvester Stallone one.  From all indications, the movie wasn't trying to do camp on purpose.  It was a huge budget SciFi film.  But between countless edits, adding and removing of violence and constant shifting crews, the movies tone changed so many times I don't know if anyone understood what it was in the end.  What we got was a movie with a great premise but laughable acting and design.  And somehow I feel like it balanced out to something really fun.  Stupid, but fun.",0.8827,194

"This was a completely miserable description of the ""so bad its good"" category I dont even know where to start criticizing. You have conflated dozens of directing styles and given them an umbrella term ""campy"". You put many movies on this list that were never ever considered ""so bad its good"" such as the Princess Bride, which is as much of a comedy as it was anything else from its conception. By they definition for ""camp"" that you have given, all comedies would go into the category ""so bad its good"". Movies like Sharknado, Dead Snow, and any movie directed by Ewe Boll have their own category, its the ""complete shit"" category, and they did not exist before the digital age for very Pragmatic reasons. You would never see the original MST2K poke jabs at movies in this ""complete shit"" category because the people who made these movies were never trying to make a piece of art, fell short, and is now worthy of a little fun poking. The ""complete shit"" directors had no investment in anything with real heart, but just didnt have the money for anything but the film itself. There are real movies out there that are ""so bad its good"" and it was usually never intentional. To juxtapose, the ""complete shit"" movies being made today are not ""campy"", they are shitty, The intent of these directors often times is to recreate the vibe of movies that *were* ""so bad its good"" without understanding that those movies they are poking jabs at, are actually good because the they directors tried their damndest to make a vision come to life on a shoestring budget. Your understanding of this ""so bad its good"" movies is what I have come to expect from typical millennials that dont understand why movies from before their generation continue to be regurgitated by Hollywood oftentimes with disastrous results. 
I will give a homework lesson to you poor, unwise, unlearned millennial. Why is the original Point Break fantastic, and the remake ""complete shit"", if you say,""the remake is just as good or better"", you simply have no taste in movies, If you say, ""the original had more camp"" you fail to understand. There *are* still good movies being made out there today, but there is volumes more ""complete shit"" to wade through before finding one.",-0.9893,465
