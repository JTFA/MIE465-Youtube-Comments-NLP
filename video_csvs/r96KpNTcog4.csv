"Another trope that's in the same vain as the continued conversation montage is the continued sentence scene change. I mean it's pretty much the same as what's shown here with just fewer cuts. Like character 1 begins describing something in one scene then it cuts to like a completely different time and place and the character finishes the conversation.

I would love to see the in between for that where there's like hours of the other character(s) asking, ""so will you finish explaining what you were saying earlier to me already? It's been 4 hours of you just sitting in silence blankly""",0.8402,112

"So, so, great! This type of self-aware comedy is really refreshing! I feel like a lot of entertainment these days relies too much on tropes of years past, lacking a lot of originality. I'm not overly critical of that sort of thing, I love campy movies and overdramatic TV (entertainment is entertainment, ya know?), but I still notice how commonplace it seems to be. That said, it's because of---for lack of a better term---mainstream entertainment that cause your videos to stand head-and-shoulders above the rest. I don't think you guys are trying to make any big statements with your work, I feel like your main focus is to make genuinely funny and original content (you're killing it, by the way), but at the same time creating this new genre that is greatly appreciated.

Sorry for the liberal-arts-thesis of a comment, all I'm trying to say is you dudes make the bestest funnies on YouTube, keep it up! 

Also, I agree with other people saying a good way to grow your channel would be to upload maybe once a week with the 3 easier-to-produce videos (behind the scenes, Q+A, bloopers), followed by the big, awesome, high-quality sketch once a month. But honestly, whatever you guys choose to make, I'll be here to watch! :)",0.9945,251
