This also occasionally happens to my arms in certain poses. Is that normal? Thanks for your amazing teaching. It is changing me for the better.",0.8934,61

I am so grateful for your yoga channel. The 30 days of yoga challenge really helped me cope with depression and anxiety. Now I discovered this new TRUE 30 days and I feel so excited.

Last Tuesday, we did some lunges at the end of the training, and one of the others started laughing, because I did them ""with as much grace as a ballet dancer"".

"Hi Adriene, i’m starting this journey today. I found TRUE in a moment of stress, doubt and anxiety. I just finished uni and i’m having a hard time finding my path and who i really am.

Hi Maia!  It's from Manduka :),0.5093,7
"Hi Mark,  I would recommend 30 Days of Yoga first for complete novice.  My other recommendation would be to make sure you check out the foundations playlist if you come across a pose you would like to understand a little better (or what modifications might make it more enjoyable in the beginning.)  I continue to return to some of the foundation videos.  TRUE is really an amazing experience, but, for me, I know i enjoyed it much more because I was familiar with yoga, Adriene's style, and had built up some strength and stretch and breath.  Just my humble opinion.  Hope it helps and all the best!!",0.9875,122

"I am terrified of the inner strength this journey will take me on, both physically and emotionally. 

Motive: There is a lot of pain inside that needs dealing with. I am facing many health issues if I don't heal my mind so i can heal my body. This is my first small commitment to healthy choices.

After a long time of feeling out of control and my emotions being in control of my mind, in this practice you reminded me of the true power that lies within me.

"I hardly ever exercise and one of the problems I've had with doing yoga is that because I'm not physically strong at all, a lot of yoga routines I find are too difficult for me to do, especially because I can't do Downward Facing Dog because it hurts my elbows really bad, and Downward Facing Dog is in EVERYTHING. So when you started doing Downward Facing Dog, I actually paused the video and nearly gave up and said welp, this is too difficult for me. But then I remembered that you said something about doing what feels right for your body and not doing what doesn't feel right, and I also remembered the motive I thought of at the beginning of the video, because the first thing I thought of was that my motive is to remember that I can do things that are difficult. I have a bad habit of giving up on things that I think are too hard or things I can't do perfectly the first time, and I wanted to remember that I am capable of more than I think. Soooo even though a part of me felt silly, I did plank instead of downward facing dog and finished the video, and you know, that's better than nothing, so thank you!

Also does anyone have any suggestions for getting better at Downward Facing Dog? It seriously feels like my elbows are dying when I attempt it.",-0.9559,259
"I have been checking out your videos and doing them for a couple weeks - I'm doing this to bring myself to the next level besides playing around. my motive is to be a better me so I can be better to me, for me. practice turning off the outside world and learn how to just do me for a little bit. thanks so much for your great videos!! I look fwd to day 2 and more!",0.9348,84
"I just came across your videos and already watched the first two for the 30 day true program and just finished day 1. I've had some experience with different types of yoga but since I stopped working at a studio I felt like my home practice was getting stale (it's better for me to watch someone and mimic as I've only had about 200 hours of training). Anyway, my passion and excitement for yoga has reignited and I thank you for that. I look forward to the rest of the videos.",0.9595,98
I just finished Day 1 and I have to say I feel amazing! I got even more out of this session than I knew I would. Thank you so much for your inspiration. Can't wait for Day 2!!,0.8904,43

I love it but my only critique is that you talk too much during the practice,0.3818,16
"I love the moments when you make me chuckle or even laugh out loud. Such an unintended release. Adrienne, I find practicing with you so restorative. Thank you for pushing me and for bringing up emotions I've buried inside. Most of all, thanks for being the light that is you.
Namaste.",0.9472,59
I love you. You are me and my motive is self-love. Everything is the self; I am the self. Love is; I am. I am everything. I am love. Self-love is everything an everything is the Self.

"It's Day 1! Welcome everyone. Have I told you how awesome it is for you to say yes and commit to a 30 Day Yoga Journey? Seriously - you are awesome. Today's theme is motive. 

We often rely on motivation to come from an outside source. But what if you realized that it could come from within?

We begin with focusing on motive because aligning with the reason why you are here sets the tone for what you will experience on the journey. 

If you are here to smell like a fart and feel lousy then you will likely accomplish that. 

A student’s motive to go to school is to learn. 

What is your motive for join TRUE? Now, wait! Stick with me!If you do not know your MOTIVE yet - that is 100% OK! It’s perfect. It will likely reveal itself and feel amazing when it does. If it does. We are here to uncover and circle back to that feeling of… you. 

The true you. 

The real you. 

~ Share with us your motive down below! What is your reason for committing to TRUE? 


PS: 100% okay to not know your motive yet!!!",0.9932,230

Melvin Muñoz you can do it my dude! I just finished the 30 days of yoga challenge and came to do this! I was also pretty tight in my body but I can now hold the crow pose for like 15-20secs after weeks of practice and I can also do the pigeon pose and forward fold with my head on the ground! It's pretty amazing and empowering to constantly see your mind and body improving each moment you step on that mat! Good luck and I hope you stick with it! Cheers dude! 🤘🏽,0.9897,102

thank you Adriene for your heartwarming guiding, and thank you myself for accepting the invitation for this amazing , magical journey , i believe that this journey will have a very positive impact in my life .

Also I want to be happy, enjoy every second i am living, and find my peace of mind , and me practicing with you makes me incredibly happy, i am so excited about waking up tomorrow, showing up on the mat, and rocking my day !
