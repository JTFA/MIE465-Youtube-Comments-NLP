"Well, there is a story of four black adults kidnapping a disabled teen, holding him at gunpoint, tying him up yelling at him saying racist things about white people to him, forcing him to drink toilet water physically attacking him, and yelling insults about Trump, but speakers on CNN find it hard to say or didn't even say at all that this was hate crime. If this was a black person that was getting tortured, and held at gunpoint, the whole internet would be outraged and big political and pop culture celebrities would be posting motivational videos ans saying how this would be wrong. But the thing about this is, the first time I heard of the story and saw the video was only about a two weeks ago. This shows how fast it is spreading around(not that fast whatsoever) and affecting peoples viewpoints on how this should not be blamed on other things than those individuals actions and their motives. You could easily imply this story and how it was the opposite of Oprah's story given at 5:28 but it got way more that were effected and that said this was wrong than the other story. And you could easily say (and you wouldn't be wrong) that black people have the privilege in America. This is because they could claim police brutality and not have any proof, they say that they can't be racist, be completely discriminatory and place false stereotypes on entire races and go back to the past and say what white people did, but one fact, they say that white people were slave owners but lets face the fact, not one slave owner is alive today.
