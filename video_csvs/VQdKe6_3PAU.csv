Ever since I was a kid I had this question about the Magic Muffin... If Timmy could wish anything without Da Rules intervening, why didn’t he just wish to be able to always have rules-free wishes? All his wishes would be as if came from the muffin forever, even when the treat was gone, instead of having to save the muffin and take small bites every time.

On Spider-Man:
The web shooter is pressure sensitive so that if Spidey applies too much pressure, it does not work.
Also, his wall crawling is based either on tiny hairs or van der wals forces. (depending on the incarnation) As such, as long as the gloves and boots are thin or the hairs can reach through, it will work.

That means that Danny cannot see many times either.
