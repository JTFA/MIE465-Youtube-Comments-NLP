"*Even in 2030 cars would look nothing like that.* They will look almost exactly the same as now, only restyled a bit. Just like the cars of 2018 look almost just as the cars of 2006 looked, there is nothing futuristic in the change that happened in the last twelve years.
That said, the concept does look cool. It is just we should not be deluded into believing that they will ever become real cars -- even twelve years from now. And, by the way, the cars of 2030 will still have a steering wheel and pedals, those things will not go away even decades from now both as a security feature and as an entertainment for drivers who will still want at times to control their cars manually (though later it will be considering unsafe so drivers will be allowed to drive themselves only in special places where they would not be able to crash into other cars this easily as in the city).",0.7453,182

"@Ginkoman2 - Where are you getting your information from related the carbon footprint of the Tesla? I've done some research and found out that manufacturing a Model S is the same as manufacturing any other luxury sedan (except the battery which adds another 15% to the carbon footprint). But that's about it, and that footprint is negligible when taking into account that the ICE vehicle will burn fuel it's entire life span. Also, studies found out that the difference between using an ICE and EV in terms of carbon footprint is 53% (and that is taking into account the production of electricity to power the vehicle). Oh and one more thing, Tesla is recycling the batteries, further reducing the carbon footprint. With this in mind, comparing a Humvee with a Tesla in terms of carbon footprint and stating that the difference comes only after 15-20 years is very erroneous.",-0.4754,166

An electric car has no benefit to the envionment compared to a modern diesel car until you've driven it for about 10 up to 20 years, because the production of car batteries is really energy intensive.

"Self-driving cars can work if no HUMAN beings are driving on the road. This is because the AI cannot comprehend with human's emotional and illogical/logical thinking/control. However, if there is no human driving on the road, then it will be way easier to have self-driving cars 
 to work because the car that you will be sitting in will be able to communicate with the other vehicles that are NOT driven by humans.

Cars will be able to know the acceleration and decelerations of one another and will act accordingly. This will allow standardization of speed on the road and highway (meaning everyone will at the same speed 140 - 200km/per hour) without losing speed and avoid accidents altogether.

Accidents usually happen because of human error/lack of skill and decisions made. We can have a pro driver and be surrounded with shitty drivers and accidents will happen because pro driver cannot comprehend the ability of the shitty driver and shitty drivers are afraid to go faster than 80km per hour. Not saying self-driving will not have accidents, accidents that occur for self-driving would be because of the car itself that malfunctions, people who argue that self-driving cars will malfunctions thus it is not safe.....do you know your car that you are driving now can malfunction too right?

In all, self-driving car can work effortless if no humans are driving on the road but this will take many years because they will need all non-driving cars to be thrown away or be obselete before they can implement it on a global scale or....simply have a separate lane for self-driving and normal cars.",-0.9098,298

"So you just have no idea. First of all there is a difference between Auto-pilot, Self-driving, and lane-keeping.
Then there is a difference between Concepts and released cars.
And Mercedes was the pioneer for years in termes of Gadgets like lane keeping-, parking-assists.
Remeber the current tesla ""Auto-pilot"" (wich actually is just a better lane keeping assist) is based on the Distronic from mercedes.
And then the biggest point. Mercedes is engineering it so it can be build in large numbers with high quality. 
Tesla is like the Apple of the automotive world. Its not the best in anything but knows how to advertise and sell their image. BUT Tesla does have serious quality control problems and the biggest problem is, you cant buy a Tesla bacause they cant manufacture them fast enough. And that is one of the biggest points and one that really matters. Car in the future need to be samll, inexpensive and available. Mercedes is on the right way in my opinion.",-0.7426,189

"Well I can give you the reasons for why that's happening.
A recent survey among the leading car brand ceo's and top managers revealed that 72 Percent of them don't believe in a future with electric vehicles. Among German car bosses, that percentage is 100 Percent. They all believe that fuel cell cars will be the actual future of the car industry. So basically what you are seeing is not big car brands missing out on the future, but big car brands waiting out the electric car trend.
Now what the future of cars actually is, is debatable. But from their perspective, it would make much sense to invest a whole lot in something, they don't believe in, would it?",0.09,133
"Well every brand is investing in new technology. And btw. electric cars are reality. The problem is to mass produce them with quality and the 2nd problem is the infrastructure.
Its not ok when one guy wants to power load his tesla in 20mins but in that time period the entire village has no power.
3rd problem is where the power comes from.
Driving electric cras using coal is not a smart change.
and back to the investments. Yoi know the reason why batterys and electric motors are so powerfull today is because companys like toyota, Porsche and Daimler were researching this for decades in their racing teams. 
I predict it will go this way: petrol->hybrid->fuel cell.
I think the fuel cell will be much easier then to produce the power centralised and to have to deal with overproduction of power etc.",-0.5968,159

"Yes, it will.  That's what level 4 self driving is -- fully autonomous driving.  Level 5 is also fully autonomous driving, just with the steering wheel entirely removed & no option at all for manual driving.

There have been plenty of demonstrations throughout the years of level 4 autonomous driving, & the bottom line is this:

Most companies are coming out & saying that 2019 or 2020 is the year that they will be selling level 4 self-driving cars... Chevy, Toyota, BMW, Audi, VW, etc. that's the timeframe that they're all thinking.

And the fact that they're all willing to say that publicly tells me that they've all basically already figured it out.  There's not ""a lot of work"" to go... there's just the little niggling things that need ironing out.",0.0571,152

I mean the Tesla Model 3 is nice, but its not available wich makes it useless. and mercedes had an all electric SLS AMG in 2012.
So no, you are just not right.

And this doesnt even account the problems in resource availability for producing batteries etc.
wich leads us to tha last point wich is the eco friendlyness of electric cars like tesla. The ecological footprint of an Tesla compared to a Humvee is equal after 15-20 years of using it. so only after 15 years your tesla is better for the environment than a humvee.",0.5423,168
