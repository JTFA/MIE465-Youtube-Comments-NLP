"#BREAKING: At Elimination Chamber it will be John Cena vs Roman reigns as final 2 in the ring. Fans will boo continously and when John is about to hit the 5 Knuckle Shuffle the gong hits, lights out, Undertaker in the ring. Roman wakes up and Undertaker looks at him but attacks Cena with a Chockeslam...then the gong hits again and Taker dissapears. Roman is confused, goes in the corner signals the spear, hits the spear, 1,2,3 Roman wins and there we have the start of the feud: JOHN CENA VS THE UNDERTAKER IN A RETIREMENT MATCH!",-0.63,112

Taker wins one last time to the public's amazement with the bulldozer dumping the sand on top of Sting...after Taker falls to the ground exhausted, a white horse carriage arrives with a coffin and and the monks carry Taker to the coffin, descend the coffin to the second hole in the ground...the fight ends with only Taker tombstone in the spotlight with fire and lightning bolts written """" R.I.P UNDERTAKER Death Valey 1983-((date off debut but no date off Death or this currently year) leaving the question if Taker one day comeback)) WM34""..at the end we hear the comment of the mithical Jim Ross says ...

"Left in the ring is the uniform, the symbol of death, and the trademark from the spawn of Satan himself. Pathetic right? The most powerful being amongst men, was defeated by a push over with some mediocre skills.. The bigger question is how? I may note that the Deadman has died 5 times. And each time has came back stronger faster and hungrier. So why the sudden decline you might say? The longest period of time the Deadman was left alive was 7 years. In between 98 till 05. 7 years each year becoming closer to death. In another light what is death to the undertaker? Death to the undertaker is life it's his whole creation purpose and drive. Any pattern of showing a more dominant intimidating and overall power upon each return is no coincidence. With each soul he cast into the abyss will be his for consumption or perhaps stored until needed. 7 years was the longest time. After 5 years being undead the dead man grew weaker with each passing year each and every match (explaining the famous streak to end) nobody on the current roster (universe) is even competent of killing the dead man. Explaining only 2 more years deciding to stay active in his sole duties of collecting the most exotic of souls. There are no more. The undertaker has consumed most if not all of them. Sad to say but the Deadman duties on Earth are over with his Armageddon has arrived 7 years of darkness will now turn into a war, between heaven and hell but this time heaven will win. As heaven wins powerful ones will emerge only to find themselves falling down the unbeaten path of the wicked that once walked. And when that time comes the prophecy of the Deadman will again be ensured. Do not confuse yourself the Deadman has not died he has vanished, waiting in the dark corner waiting until his dark corner covers the earth once more then he will awaken, and begin reaping and consuming all the evil and darkness again in order to keep the balance of the universe one must become the dark one. There can only be one and I can not wait until the second coming of The Undertaker so until then, Rest In Peace.",-0.9648,419

"You know, I somewhat feel like Kane should have been the one to retire him--to break his streak, even. It would have been a good younger-brother-finally-bests-the-older-brother storyline. Then, they could have retired the also-aging (and IRL politically-motivated) Kane via Strowman, who would then rampage like he has been doing, commentators billing him as the new face of unstoppable monstrousness all the while, until Roman Reigns arrived to stop him and settle their score.

I don't have a problem with the Undertaker retiring--he deserves to be able to lay his career to rest after so many injuries spanning a career of almost three decades (more than that, if you count his pre-WWF days). I don't have a problem with Strowman becoming the new big monster in Kane's place--Kane is imposing, but he's getting on too. I don't even have a problem with Reigns being the new big dog in the yard, in spite of how incessantly they've been trying to get him over. I think he's a decent competitor, albeit needing a bit more in his move set.

All of this is fine; there was just a better way to do it, really.",0.7627,216
