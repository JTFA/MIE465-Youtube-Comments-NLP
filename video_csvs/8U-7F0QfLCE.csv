Absolutely hideous front end. Shiny black plastic mouth. Even the hood cut line is ridiculously stupid. The taillights look like a glob of stretched red¬†plastic. The spoiler is too small to bother and looks bad black. The wheels are too busy. These cars are bought by middle aged white folks who aren't Star Wars groupies. Well at least they bought them until now...don't think they will sell more than last years dismal 30k. Certainly the last gen Avalon.,-0.8349,90

Grill no. Headlights and taillights yes. Still lugging around with a nose heavy 3.5 V6..meh.  Time for Toyota to get get with the times.

I have the 2013 limited edition Avalon but this.....does bring a smile to my face,0.4215,17
I kinda like the grill although it is a bit blocky. At least there are the lines going down near the center breaking it up a little.  Don't think making it look anything like a Lexus is a smart idea. Toyota is really gonna have to step up the ES and IS. This center dash is wonky looking to me and cheap. Finally Apple carplay. Cause the Scout GPS app is just simply insulting. Please show the dash/center console from the back seats it shows it better.,0.7972,97

If I hadn't bought that Camry already, I would be going for this wide grille avalon fully loaded. Views on cars are very subjective.",0.6597,97
