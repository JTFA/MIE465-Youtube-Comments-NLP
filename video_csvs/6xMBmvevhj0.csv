"Firstly, you people complaining about Calvin not doing his Ready For The Weekend clearly have no clue what the word ""Progression"" means. The times have changed, so move the fuck on.

Secondly, all you other people saying that this video is cheap and lazy. Firstly, I would like to see you make this on your phone in under a day if you think it is so easy. Secondly, the video is intentionally cheap to fit with the vibe of the song, being a 90s throwback and all.",0.0174,100

Mi and di mandem
We haffi run from half of di gyal dem
(So sweet, so sweet)
Dem want mi children and ting
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
(So sweet, you're so sweet)
Yeah, mi nuh ready fi all dem things yet
(So sweet, so sweet)
Yeah, I'm not ready fi all dem tings yet
I'm not ready fi all dem tings yet
She call me kid, kid, kid
My mama kiss her kid
She say mi tooth-tooth sweet
She say mi tooth-tooth sweet
Don't make me feel like I love you
Just 'cause I thought you was special
Won't make me feel like I love you
Baby, girl, I won't settle
Yeah I had dreams of fuckin' the baddest bitch
Last night I awoke up and I fucked the baddest bitch
I thought I would be ready when I seen her
When I was in the disco
(I gotta keep it honest)
Keep it real with you
Mi and di mandem
We haffi run from half of di gyal dem
(You're so sweet, so sweet)
Dem want mi children and tings

Dem want mi children and tings
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
(So sweet, you're so sweet)
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
(So sweet, so sweet)
I strapped up 'cause they mapped up
'Cause I need to know where you are
Can't keep following these signs
'Cause you're lookin' for a sign, and I can't give you one
Start to feel like it's mad love
That's givin' your attraction, to me
Yeah, I just want you, nobody else, baby
I don't wanna get too far
It's just you that I want
When it's mi and di mandem
We haffi run from half of di gyal dem
(You're so sweet, so sweet)
Dem want mi children and tings
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
(So sweet, you're so sweet)
