"Cunning Media Now that I went back and saw it, the gold wings Candice wore in the 2011 spell segment were the same ones that Izabel Goulart wore in the 2015 portrait of an Angel segment. It just shows me that VS  is running out of creativity these days and has no idea what to make anymore. It's all rehashed themes and ideas.",0.1027,67
Curious what you look like 😂,0.5859,6
"DippityDo No, I do not think so. Because nobody says costumes. The models are always saying “ I am going to change to my next outfit.” And besides costumes means when you dress as something else.",-0.296,42

"I can see why the wings would be reused, especially because they're doing so many winter segments now. It takes time, money, and a lot of manpower to make wings, so it seems pointless to re-make white angel wings when you can easily reuse them for the shows, commercials, and public appearances. But it seriously makes the show boring. We're all expecting these ""giant shows and amazing wings"" only to have wings from 2012-2014 now make a re-appearance. (Romee wore Doutzen's 2014 wings AND Adriana's 2013 wings). Now that I think about it, the wings Lily wore in the 2014 Angel Ball segment were probably the same ones worn by Taylor Hill in the 2015 Boho segment AND Barbara Fialho in the 2016 Dark Angel segment.",0.25,143

"I must say I agree..perhaps, they just ran out of ideas..will be better to have 1 show every 2 years perhaps..",0.4404,27
"I think 2014 was a great year though (especially w/ the Fantasy Bras). Plus, as you can see, the show really starts from nothing in the 90s and gets significantly better in the early 2000s (LOOK AT HEIDI'S WINGS!!! Amazing).

"STOP REUSING WINGS!!!! I have to say as much as I like Romee, her part in Nomadic Adventure seemed like a pointless reason to add her to another segment. Her outfit didn't really fit with the collection. Plus...Doutzen's wings...really? 🙄",0.4953,51

They stop making big wing and reusing old wing again and again lol,0.1531,13
"They were. You're not wrong. I noticed that too. Plus Lily D. had similar wings in a different segment but they were pink and white. It's like...really....couldn't think of anything else? I could design an entire pink show off the top of my head with cray cray wings, and they'd be authentic.",0.4547,64
Those look more like Doutzen's wings to me from that segment. Alessandra's had much longer feathers to them. But it's not the first time VS reused wings. Romee actually wore Adriana's wings from the 2013 snow angels section in the 2015 ice angels section.,0.4201,48
