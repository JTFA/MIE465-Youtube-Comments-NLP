"Michelle, I'm glad you are home. I hope and pray you recover 100%. Dr. Lee is the most sweetest Dr's I've ever seen. I'm a big popaholic and NewYear day eve I had to rushed to the ER after I dropped my dinner and while cleaning it up I had grabbed a knife to put into the sink and it was slippery because I was going to mop up the stuff up next. I wind up slipping on the mess with the knife still in my left hand and it went into my left pinky finger and deep to the bone. I had to get 3 stitches. While I was waiting I was watching some of the few recent videos I haven't seen because of I haven't been feeling well.  I told the PA who apologized for taking long to tend to me that Its okay I'm just watching Dr, Pimple Popper I'm a proud popaholic. Once she stitched up my finger. I said they need to come out 7-10 days right? She did a double take, she goes yes exactly. I've been watching Dr. Pimple popper for years now I said. We both cracked up.  The only thing as I settled into bed last night I shot up oh no!! I missed the TLC Special no!!!! I hope they put it on again. Thank you Robert sir, for your service to our country!!!
