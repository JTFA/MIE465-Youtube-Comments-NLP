"The video is full of inaccurate information. First of all, from Spain to France, you never needed to change trains at the border (at least not in my lifetime). Although very few, there were some direct services from Madrid and Barcelona to other European cities like Paris, Montpellier, Zurich and Milan, even before high-speed lines were built. Also, the reason for Spain building wider tracks than France was not to avoid French invasion (although it is a wide-spread, urban legend) but because at the time, it was thought that bigger engines were to be used because of Spain's mountainous geography. There is also one regular train from Yiwu, China; to Madrid, which is in fact the longest freight train service on the world and not the one to London. To finish with, high-speed tracks in Galicia are not still standard-gauge; they are built in Iberian gauge and will be migrated into standard when connected to the rest of the high-speed network.",0.2946,185
