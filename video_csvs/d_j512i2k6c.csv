"Hi from Tohoku, Japan. Earthquakes are very common here. We even had one that lasted several minutes today. They could still be aftershocks from the 2011 disaster but it could just be the Pacific Ring of Fire doing it‚Äôs thing. I think Japan would still be a contender for the next big one. Earthquakes are tens to hundreds times more frequent here than other countries, even those on the pacific ring like America or New Zealand. That said, they‚Äôre prepared like no other country. Alerts aren‚Äôt even issued for magnitude 4 or less and magnitude 5-6 earthquakes are a minor every day occurrence. Earthquakes of this magnitude are serious disasters for most countries. Every building is earthquake safe, every major city in Japan would be ok. It‚Äôs one of the main reasons most of the older buildings weren‚Äôt built very high, even in Tokyo. It is only the small towns in coastal regions that are in danger of Tsunami damage but the repairs and improvements to reduce this are still underway in Tohoku.",-0.6705,200

"The only thing I fear now, that could happen today or tomorrow, is a Yellowstone super eruption. Based on geologic studies by experts, the supervolcano erupts once in approximately every 600,000 to 800,000 years. And the last super eruption occurred about 650,000 years ago. So we are due for another. We had been for about 50,000 years. And the next eruption could be not for about another 150,000 years. But that doesn't rule out the possibility for a super eruption to occur today or tomorrow. And if it happens, the eruption would be so powerful, it would not form a volcanic mountain, but would go so far into the sky, it would spread in the atmosphere to the point that it would not come down as liquid or volcanic rock, but would be in the form of volcanic dust/ash which would flow in the atmosphere across the entire globe, reflect sunlight, we would enter a volcanic ice age that would last a century or two. Crops would die; farming would become impossible, even at the equator, except for indoors. But with a lot of heating against the ice age temperatures. Vehicle and flight transportation would become impossible. Solar and hydro electricity would become impossible. Snow levels would exceed 100 ft. Blizzards of a degree we have never experienced anything like- would occur frequently all over the globe. More tornadoes than ever before would occur. Roofs would collapse from the weight of thick piles of snow. Snow would pile up around the perimeter of homes, blocking any doors almost daily even if maintained in heavy duty daily. The winds could shatter every window. With a world population of over 7 billion people at a time if a super eruption were to occur soon, the population could drop more than 99.99% by the time such a volcanic ice age would end. Such an eruption really would lead to an apocalypse.",-0.655,357
