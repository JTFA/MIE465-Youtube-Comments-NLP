@kingofrandom what happened if you put liquid nitrogen with propane,0.0,10
"After seeing it. No it was not additional nitrogen. It was because the diesel snow lowers the temperature of the diesel to a point lower than it needs to burn. 
Diesel has an almost 100 degrees hotter flashpoint than gasoline at around 50 degrees celsius if memory serves. While Gasoline has a flaspoint of way below the freezing point. Gasoline can burn in a freezer, Diesel can't.

In other words, trying to ignite the diesel next to frozen diesel is like trying to make ice cubes(H2O) in room temperature.",-0.4215,101

"Great video!! Diesel has almost the same flashpoint as Jet A1. It needs heat & pressure to ignite. In turbine engines we refer to a state called ""self sustainable"" where the engine combustion in the compressor doesn't need any further electric ignition during start-up. Cold, non pressurized Jet Fuel or diesel are both very difficult to ignite or combust.... which makes that scene in ""Die Hard 2"" where John McClane (Bruce Willis) used a lighter to lite the Jet Fuel spilled on the snowy runway totally impossible. This video basically just busted the Die Hard 2 plane explosion scene myth. Also the jelling effect under extreme temperatures in Jet Fuel is exactly what caused the crash of British Airways Flight 38 in 2008 when the fuel in the wings were exposed to extreme temperatures flying over Siberia prior to landing.",-0.9182,156
