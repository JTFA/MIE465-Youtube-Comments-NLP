So yeah, don't eat tidepods.

"Jesus Christ loves you with a love that can't be described with mere words. It is an eternal love that will NEVER cease. When you give your life completely to Christ you are accepting a magnificent, awe-inspiring, monumental gift of love and deep intimacy with the one who created you and knew before the beginning of time. Dear ones give yourself fully to Jesus Christ right now. Walk boldly along the path of Life, relying on your ever present Companion in Jesus. He will accompany you all the days of your life - and onwards into eternity. ❤️❤️❤️ (John 20:19, 21; John 14:27; Hebrew 12:2; Isaiah 41:13)",0.9859,127
