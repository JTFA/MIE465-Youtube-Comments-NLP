"Im taking collision repair at Universal Technical Institute and will be getting a job as an apprentice Bodyman at hopefully a bodyshop soon. What's the cost of owning a Diesel truck? I want a 2017 Silverado 2500hd 4x4 High Country. (Where I'm possibly moving I will need a truck). I already know that payment alone will be like $1200 a month (fuck me...),  I'm sure gas will be like $400 a month and insurance? I'm guessing I need to have at least $1900 a month for starters which isn't super bad for what guys at bodyshops make. Especially if your on flat rate. A lot of guys do like 150 hours of paid work in a 40 hour week at about $20-$40 an hour. That's 600 hrs a month times 20. (Yes, it is very possible to make $12,000 in one month as a body man at $20 an hour, depending on the location). But I've only driven a 2nd gen Cummins like twice let alone owning one, so anybody with a newer Duramax, cummins, or powerstroke have any ballpark estimates you can shoot me? I'd appreciate that. I'm probably getting a new truck in like 6 months when I graduate so I gotta know what I can do now to prepare for it.",0.8967,249

Oh and another thing if you're going to wheel you should probably change your rim size to a dramatically smaller size like a 15 by 10 with beadlocks and increase your tire size to like a 38 or maybe even a 40 inch mudder instead of those cute little skateboard wheels you got on there now lol jk .
