"I am disturbed by the fact that most Americans see the problem with Jerusalem in such one sided manner. Please understand that It doesn't matter who had Jerusalem as their capital city first. What matters is that this city has turned into a religious symbol for the three major religions in the world. Claiming it as a capital by one of the involved parties will automatically trigger a violent response by the other. For this same reason, Jerusalem has acquired a special status, putting it out of the table. This aims to stabilize the relations between these parties and initiate a process of improvement. Peace is achieved with common understanding and compromises, not with unilateral selfish actions and aggression. Standing against the decision of the US Government is not an insult against USA or Israel. It is an action of deterrence of something wrong being done.

On the other hand I am very disappointed by the actions of the US administration at the UN assembly. Threatening the other nations to vote in your favor is demoralizing for all countries who see the US as guardian of democracy on a global level. Such behavior is demeaning not for the other countries, but for the US people, who I firmly believe disagree with such violent actions.",-0.7818,231

Example: China claims  it's  Capital  is Beijing but other countries put their Embassy in Hong Kong then US simply  moves  it's  Embassy  from Hong Kong to Beijing.  

Of course, the UN can't  tell the US where to put the Embassy!  It's  America's wish  and  as Israel is not  saying  No.  The Country is not  saying  no.  They can put where ever they want.

They would put American citizens in prison for boycotting a country that Donald Sterling boasted ""treats blacks like dogs"".  A country that sterilizes african refugees.
         Could you imagine America putting african American's in prison for boycotting a country that sterilizes black africans?
