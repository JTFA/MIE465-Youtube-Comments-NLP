Curry made some regular contested layups, contested 3s, and a lot of open 3s. Scoring 47 was impressive, but the plays were not nothing special.  Had he made a half court shot or dribble through 3 defenders and score, he would've made top 10, but he didn't.

The Lord loves you! He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

Jesus came down to die and rise again for us all. He did this out of love for us! 

John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved this world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life! 
Jesus also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him (John 6:37)

So friends, come to Jesus today and make Him Lord of your life. You will be saved! He is not asking for a lot of faith, He says the size of a mustard seed is sufficient! You also don't need a prayer that's fancy, on your knees and eloquent. All you need is sincere words from your heart, whether you're sitting down, on your knees, or even on your death bed. You just speak to The Lord from the heart, and He will hear you. I assure you. 

Jesus will also make a Way to escape the judgement headed to this earth! 

So repent, call upon Him today, and you will be saved! Hallelujah!

Shalom!",0.9891,240
