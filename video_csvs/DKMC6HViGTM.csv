"Dear Jackie Hall,

Please, what ""BS"" did I spread?

You wouldn't want something you did in the '70s to follow you forever? Don't pose for propaganda posters with enemy forces during an armed conflict in which U.S. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines are dying, daily, and had no say in going, as the vast majority of them were DRAFTED.

Most of us, were NOT protesting the Vietnam war. Only a small, but vocal minority, but hey, why let historical facts get in the way of your pretty little narrative.

She was young and did a foolish thing? No, at 17, I joined the United States Army, Military Police Corps, and defended Western Europe against the Communist threat. Age, or lack thereof, is no excuse for treason.

Foolishness is when a women claims to be a feminist and demands ""equality"", while refusing to sign up for, or sign their daughters up for Selective Service. Posing with enemy combatants, on an enemy anti-aircraft gun that was directly responsible for placing U.S. personal in the torture centers that passed for P.O.W. camps in Vietnam, is TREASON.

You say the news reporters ""created that lie""? Amazing. I didn't even realize they HAD photoshop back then... but wait! She never claimed it didn't happen. Did the news reporters ""create"" the audio of her broadcasting from behind enemy lines, telling our soldiers they are war criminals as well, and encouraged them to disobey their lawfully issued orders?

https://youtu.be/qX7QQde6HZ4

Those were open broadcasts from Jane Fonda, during the time of an armed conflict, from behind enemy lines. Do you know what that's called? ""TREASON"", and yes, she should absolutely have been prosecuted and jailed, if not SHOT!

By the way Jackie, I noticed your little ""Patriarchy"" barb at the end of your post, suggesting your ""feminist"" leanings, and I've got to say, I'm curious...

...did you happen to have signed up for Selective Service, or is that a bit too ""equal""?",-0.9963,406

Get over yourself. You do live in a world where women don't have to succumb to that pressure and level of vanity. You think someone is holding Lily Tomlin down and forcing her to get plastic surgery? People aren't vain because someone makes them. They are vain because they are vain.,0.4397,56
"Glad to know I'm not the only one who feels this way. I have LOVED this show because of the silliness, the laughter, the ""real"" life things that happen, but infused with a lot of light heartedness. I'm on the second to last episode of the 4th season, and It's been pretty sad and dark. I have to say, I'm disappointed. I want the funny Grace and Frankie back. This season has TOO much sarcasm, arguing and problems, there's enough of this in the world already. Hope next year's season is better.",0.8056,108

"Hey, Netflix! I'm currently bingewatching Season 4 of ""Grace and Frankie""! I just finished bingewatching all of ""Disjointed"" the other day. Can we PLEASE get a crossover episode between ""Grace and Frankie"" and ""Disjointed""? I feel like Ruth Whitefeather Feldman (Kathy Bates) had to have crossed paths with Frances ""Frankie"" Bergstein (Lily Tomlin) at SOME point in their lives. They've travelled in a lot of the same circles, have a lot of things in common (they're both hippies), and they're about the same age. Maybe Grace and Frankie can sell vibrators in Ruth's pot store? Netflix and chill and bust a nut lol? Anyway, think about it.",0.9506,136

"I love grace and Frankie and I'm looking forward to the new season. The trope of opening up a troubled relationship really pisses me off though. Your relationship has to be solid and both people have to be into it for that to work and rarely ""solves"" pre existing issues. But let's introduce it for extra conflict, and they'll learn that they really are the only ones for each other and a valid lifestyle choice for many people is pretty much invalidated because who could ever actually be non monogamous because it doesn't work for these people in particular. Rant over. Will still totally watch it. And I'm hopeful they'll handle it better than that",0.8228,124

She was a young woman and did a foolish thing, sitting on a canon and photographed.
