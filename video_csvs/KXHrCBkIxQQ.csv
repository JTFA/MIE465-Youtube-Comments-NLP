"""All the Money in the World"" is actually a pretty good movie. Christopher Plummer did a fine job, I've always been a big fan o this man. The moment when you can see Spacey as Plummer's double getting out of the train on the desert gave me goose bumps. I didn't know he was in this one shot and you can't clearly see him, but you'll know it's HIM somehow. Well, I knew it and my friends in the cinema too. Talking about his screen presence here? ;-) But... the movie was supposed to bomb with Spacey and the brutal truth so far is that it bombed without Spacey. I think if Plummer won't win an Oscar it would mean Scott is done in Hollywood for his Orwellian move.",-0.3479,143
"""Director Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski paint the screen with tones of tension, shades of noir, and ratchet up the heartbeat that much more. But the best lighting and atmospherics is when Getty is onscreen, the shades dark, temporally lonely, and enveloped in an impermeable wrap of green-bags and isolation. Actor Christopher Plummer lends an air of imperiousness that’s impenetrable and sometimes unfathomable – and you know he’s hiding an uneasy past all through for his character. That somehow, tragically, also justifies his own manic obsessiveness with money, estate, paintings, and deals.""

"'The Solitary Billionaire' is on BBC Iplayer from 1963.  It is an interview with the real Getty.  Can someone access it and post it on You Tube for us all to see.  I saw a snip of it and it is fascinating, but I haven't got the equipment to post it on here.  If  anyone can get on iplayer and put it on here it would be great.",0.836,76

For better or worse few dramas are going to generate the type of buzz that big blockbusters do.  And this is right in the middle of all the Star Wars hype, in the same year as Wonderwoman and IT.  I've heard non-stop talk in the media and from others about those films, never heard any mention of this movie.  Maybe it's the most talked about film in the Getty family.",-0.4588,139
