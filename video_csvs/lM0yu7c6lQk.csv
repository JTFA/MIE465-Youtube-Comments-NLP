The reason Apple didn't openly announce it before was that it would be a horrible PR move, so they didn't talk about it until they were asked about it, after which they said that they were slowing down iPhones, and they gave us a perfectly good reason for it. There was no better way for them to handle this.",-0.7717,253

I was never experiencing low-battery shutdowns nor even significantly reduced battery life. Slow my ass! Not only was it incredibly slow compared to iOS 10, apps are now crashing inexplicably. I was ready to throw my phone out the window. Finally, I completely restored iOS from backup. This was another disaster as many of the phones settings were lost and all my 100s of icons were out of place. After hours of reconfiguring the the iPhone, it was still incredibly slow and crashy‚Äînot as bad as before, but definitely not as stable and responsive as iOS 10 and 9. F'n Apple!",-0.4699,153

This exactly points out that Apple does not care for their customers. They keep putting out new phones every year while slowly abandoning support for older models. They push you into downloading updates and buying new phones. The obvious fix is to make battery replacement available but Apple doesn't give a shit. They want to drain you of your savings. Just look at the iPhone X. It's just the same version of the older iPhone with unnecessary shit like animojis and portrait mode cameras.,0.8935,91

"Tim Cook is probably laughing right now counting his Benjamin's and while saying ""Oh iSheep, what would I do without you?""

Slowing down phones is counter productive. And counter intuitive.  Think about it.  If your phone is fast you can do more things faster thus keeping screen on time much shorter saving more battery. 

If your phone is slow it will take twice as long to do the same things thus increasing screen on time burning battery life much faster. We all know screen on time is what burns the most batteries. 

Therefore my conclusion is Apple did this to force its users to upgrade.  

Don t even tell me about replacing a battery, it just cost too much in labor and parts to make that worth it.  

Shame on Apple!  I knew Apple is a terrible company when I owned the first iPhone 1 and never owned another Apple product since because of their focus on ripping us off.

If Apple really cares about its customers they would have offered to give out free new Batteries to its loyal customers to fix this issue instead of forcing this down peoples throats.",0.8353,208

Watching this for my iphone 6 will for me my iphone 6 is not slowing down its good phone and easy to use all you need is to upgrade your software thats the sulotion of your slowing iphone. Android phone like samsung the more you use it the more it lag and slowing it down even do you upgrade your phone. I experience it coz am a android user but I switch to ios phone iphone.,0.4235,79

"Yeah the idea that the older hardware doesn‚Äôt run newer software as well makes sense but theoretically the older hardware could run better but battery life would suffer. However, if you could replace the battery the phone could run better but because apple designs its phones to not have removable batteries they were essentially designing their hardware and software to have worse performance overtime without explicitly telling you why thus encouraging you to buy a newer phone when you could save money by just replacing the battery.",0.8705,92
