If u use dissolved mixture of different nitrates with different decomposition temperatures and different solubilities u will get something inhomogeneous, clear.

On a science show I was part of, we demonstrated a commercial grade YBCO slab, and the trick is to lower the SC below it's transition temperature with the magnet close by, separated by a paper spacer. This way the flux channels penetrate all the way through the superconductor, but are pinned on the crystal defects.

Flux pinning where you set the magnet, and it stays there only works for very thin or very bad superconductors. The thin ones because the field can easily completely destroy the superconductivity in the flux channels since they aren't very long, and the bad superconductors since there is enough non-superconducting junk that the field can pass through so it doesn't need to create long channels.",-0.9671,159

"Those two processes make me think that you could combine them. Instead of dissolving everything into a water solution, could you find some solvent that dissolves the YO, but doesn't mix with water? Perhaps the YBCO will form at the liquid boundary and precipitate out. THat has got to be better than a violent and lossy self-combustion. 

Another way to do this might be to use the nitric acid to dissolve the YO, but then simply evap the water instead of boiling it, perhaps with a vacuum chamber. That would also keep loss to a minimum. In fact, if you could somehow chemically ensure that the YCBO forms in solution, you could then grow solid crystals of it by slowing down the evap rate.

Wow! What an awesome project. Id love to make some YBCO someday.,0.9245,15
"YBCO is highly anisotropic, so it carries current only in one crystallographic plane. Grain boundaries or other perturbations in the lattice will kill your critical current instantly. This is why Powders in cables didn't work historically and wires from YBCO are now made as highly textured coatings on buffered tapes so the current carrying plane stretches throughout the tape.",-0.7906,63

You need to be careful with your fume hood.  Drawing nitric acid fumes through a fan will eat it up in a short amount of time.  Get a leaf blower and make a Venturi system instead.,0.1531,39

great video. I think it's quite possible for liquid N2 to be at a temp less than its boiling point (-196C). Evaporative cooling because it's boiling.  That's why you can put a balloon in liquid N2 and the air will liquify... that wouldn't happen if the liquid were at the boiling point temp.,0.6249,61

if you sent a huge inductance coil into orbit and spin it like a coin in the earth's magnetosphere it will generate huge currents of electricity let alone a superconductive version of it. these types of coils in space are the next level in energy conversion. inductance @ 0 gravity in a vacuum of space.. harvesting the energy of planets and stars. and at some higher level in energy would become black hole rings. star gate stuff.

zero resistance means infinite electro magnetism; or super magnetism. flux pinning becomes incorrect? seems more like an exact mirror image of the magnet through induction to current and recurrent magnetism reflection. In other words; the magnet creates its own holding point due to the ceramic's superconductivity. There is a current in both the magnet and the ceramic. Induction is occurring in both. Power transfer is the invisible energy holding them together and apart.,0.8718,82
