"I really really love this scoreboard idea, but If I have to nitpick something from the format, its that for me the fun lies in someone winning purely because of fhe conviction of their arguments, not because they want to win the game (As Perry says in almost every one of her calls).

 I'm also very competitive so I get her a bit haha, but I don't know I guess to me the point of the predictions its not about the safest or likeliest choice, Its about how the subjectivity of the movie critic matches with general opinion or not, and the reasons behind that, and that's what ultimately for me defines a great skillful scoreboard win.

Wow I went deeper than I thought.",0.9842,136
I really want Jessica Chastain to win. She deserves it and this win would give her a lot of momentum to get an Oscar nomination and finally a win. Her performance in the movie was the best performance in the category. Although I wouldn’t mind Sally Hawkins winning. Also Margot Robbie gave a career defining performance in I Tonya and she should win but I would be happy to see Saoirse Ronan win because I loved her in Brooklyn so much. I didn’t really like Lady Bird.,0.9872,97
I think Call Me By Your Name may get a shocking win,0.2732,12
I think Villeneuve should’ve gotten nominated and won but I’ve seen both Dunkirk and Shape of Water and I think Nolan will win,0.8201,27
"I think it was because of how they portrayed South Asian women. The stereotypical negative portrayal ticked off many viewers and critics, despite it being a great movie as a whole.",-0.8999,34

"I think ur right. I do enjoy Del Toro but im a big Nolan fan and would lik to see him win the oscar for director, but I think Del Toro will win. But for Best picture oscars I reckon Three Billboards",0.9728,45
I too have not seen Shape of Water but from the remaining nominees I can say that Christopher Nolan will win best director.,0.9186,24
"I will be devastated if Hans Zimmer wins over Alexander Desplat. Shape of Water had such a fantastic mystical feel, it had French undertones, it felt like you were at sea and it was flat out beautiful beautiful. I don't know how Desplat accomplished all of that at once. Much more impressive than Zimmer's loud noises.",0.9643,62
"I would argue that This Is Me actually has the stronger message while Remember Me is tied more into the fabric of its film.  The message of This Is Me, is much stronger as the song communicates the idea of not being afraid to be who you are, and accepting the fact that people may or may not like what you, but ultimately understanding the only one who can give your life meaning is yourself.  Remember Me's message is simply about holding onto the memories of those who are precious to you so that even if the people are gone physically, they are always in your heart.  Remember Me is so good because the song is woven into the film in a seamless and natural way.  This Is Me stands on its own without the movie, but still works amazingly in how it is used in the film.",0.9482,158
I wouldn't be so sure that Coco is guaranteed the win for Best Original Song with Remember Me.  I think that song has stiff competition from This Is Me from The Greatest Showman.  You should have picked Coco for Best Animated Feature though.,0.9709,46
"I'm amazed by the resemble of Perry and Sally Hawkins,  they could play sisters if not cousins in a rare ladies nights episode XD",0.8788,25
"I'm not sure. Del Toro, I think, accomplished a much bigger array of tasks. Dunkirk has great IMAX photography, but Shape of Water has that general sea weed feel in it's costume design, lighting, set design, music and editing. Nolan maybe did individual elements better, but it didn't have the great cohesion of Shape of Water.",0.9263,67
I'm still kind of shocked that The Big Sick got totally snubbed. It is such a wonderful Film. Very funny but with so much heart. You can see that combination working that great not very often.,0.7187,40
I'm surprised none of them took advantage of that for the wild card,0.4404,13
I'm surprised none of them took advantage of the fact that Coco is guaranteed to win best animated feature for the wildcard. Like seriously coco doesn't have any competition,0.9136,30
