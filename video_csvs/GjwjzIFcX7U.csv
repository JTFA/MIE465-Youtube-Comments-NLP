Well, yeah, I disagree. I think we might actually be looking at another *20 to 30* years! Seriously, Disney buying Fox and therefore returning the movie rights of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four has opened up a SHIT-TON of stories which can now be adapted AND COMBINED with the Avengers storyline. House of M, Annihilation, Secret Wars, Onslaught, Avengers vs X-Men and so on. Heck, Dr. Doom and Galactus are such universal threats, they could easily be the main villains, respectively, for phase 5 and 6 of the MCU (just like Thanos is right now). Heck, we still have so much untold stuff in the current MCU which was merely teased, like Adam Warlock, Dormammu and the Celestials/Cosmic Beings (holy shit, the Beyonder might exist in MCU). And we still haven't seen a lot of superheroes yet either (well, Captain Marvel is on the way). The MCU can and will go on for a while. Well played, Disney & Marvel Studios.",0.4184,209
