"Every interview of him is different. Check all 3 parts, how is he picking and choosing what to blame on the psych meds?",-0.34,26
"Exactly! Tyrese forgot that some of us are mental health professionals and/or can google reputable sources and read. He might have took some pills from one of his friends,  or he already had major depressive disorder or schizophrenia.

"Thank you for Doing this. I am amazed how people are so quick to jump on the bandwagon. I know exactly what he is talking about in reference to the psych medication or any medication for that fact. When you are feeling okay it does not register in you mind that something emotional can set off side effects that you are unaware of. I don't personally know this man but I love his work. Some people confuse themselves into to understanding these entertainers because of their perception of who the know this person to be. I know a lot of good fathers that don't have this mans finances that are going through the same if not similar situation. His ability to remain humbled by his experience speaks volumes. I also appreciate that you and your staff allowed him to speak for himself about what happened and not make what happen a means for ratings and further ridicule of the public's perception of how men should be behave in this situation. I would love to make the statement about how black men are perceived to be ""dead beat dads"", ""uncaring"" , ""Unworthy of their feelings"",  and so much more but what would be the point? For some random troll to have an opinion that is to irrelevant to any real issue other than likes and laughs. How he handled his situation should be a wake up call instead its made a mockery of. Great Job on the interview!! Continued success of your show and I miss C'mon Son!",0.9839,280
