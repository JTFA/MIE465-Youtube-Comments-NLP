Europe has only had relative peace in recent centuries with the rise of nation-states where even small nationalities like Slovenians are allowed self rule. Even countries like Belgium and Spain which have largely split nationalities are struggling to remain together.

If we want peace, we need to stop recognizing these arbitrary borders, start recognizing the cultural borders, and let nationalities rule over themselves. Or at least stop trying to save countries that really just need to divide.",-0.6659,148

These places have been independent for over half a century and in that time they have slid backwards, being reduced to anarchy and barbarism.

It is a telling, if unPC fact that most of these places were far better off when they were ran by their colonial overlords. No revolts, coups, rebellions, inter tribal warfare or religious intolerance when these countries were ran by people who knew what they were doing.
