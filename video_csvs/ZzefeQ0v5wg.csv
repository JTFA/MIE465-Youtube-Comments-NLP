"DON'T USE AR EMOJI, AND OTHER VIDEO ANIMATING ""FEATURES"" 
The whole point of these tools, which have felt awkward (like, really? this is a feature worth it's own segment?) since day one at the Apple launch event, is to get you to spend time letting the phone build a 3d mesh of your face, entirely in service to the surveillance industry. Yup. They do it with a fish tunnel in the Dubai airport. The more time you spend with it, with various makeup, accessories, and hats, the more you'll be able to be spotted by AI in the future. Worry about it or not.. it's your dime.
