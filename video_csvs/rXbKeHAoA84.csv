Yea, it gotta be something with that darn family tree.
Some people are poor and homeless for a reason. Getting children when you have no way of supporting them isn't ""the system"" or whatever you seem to think. It's people, usually young, being stupid...

"But it was so boring and un-filmlike. It felt like a medical flatline the whole way through except from that sad bit at the end. The lack of beginning middle and end and character arcs had me uninterested, unemotional for the whole duration (again save from that one end bit). I think the acting was believable, and the subject matter rarely seen, but as a film, as a piece of entertainment, completely uninspiring, unmoving. Children being sad almost always makes us sad, so that one bit at the end definitely isn't a saving grace for the film. I think the film sorely needed 'a point'.
And, I hear what you're saying, but I think the fact that pretty much everything you said was lost on me when I saw this in cinema means that the director/film style failed in its intention. It failed as a storytelling device, as an entertainer, as an educator. I wouldn't say this film is particularly high brow in the sense that only a film intellectual would understand its meaning, I just think it's not interesting enough to engage most filmgoing audiences (not just 'your average customer', but MOST audiences). And that's its main problem. Its not engaging. Is it Oscar worthy? I don't care.",-0.8758,245

"Didn't like this film at all. It's clearly technically accomplished, and did a great job framing the world through the kids' eyes, but it completely failed to get me emotionally invested in the mother daughter relationship. So when the film was trying to get me to want them to stay together, I was rooting for Mooney to be rescued from her mother. Similarly, when her friends were separated from her, I was glad: she was clearly a bad influence. Overall, the film left a bad taste. Glad it wasn't nominated. Dafoe was great though.",0.9423,109

"Great comments. I saw this in London, where sadly it played in too few cinemas, with only one giving it a decent run. It's not only a great movie, but a great audience movie, too, as although it shows the down side of life, there is so much humour and joy, and not a little hope. It's also the best Willem Dafoe performance that I've seen in a very long time. In future years this may be regarded as a classic when other nominated movies are completely forgotten, so perfectly does it capture the essence of childhood.",0.9612,110

This movie not getting an Oscar nomination is a joke and especially when you look at the movies that are nominated! Also, not nominating Brooklyn Prince is a joke! She is so brilliant, and much better than any of the other child actors who have been nominated in the past!  After I watched this movie I didn't sleep for a week!

From the estate I was waiting for social services to take her away from this environment. And it's hinted Moonie is going to follow in her steps unless something drastic happens.",-0.836,88

This movie was truly something else. Loved your analysis, made me process the overall emotions I got from this in a new perspective.

"so glad to see you made a video on TFP. i didn't realize how much i wanted to hear someone's else thoughts on the film. i saw this movie at the Enzian Theater, which is near orlando. i really enjoyed my experience watching it and the film itself. i wrestled w my thoughts re: the ending though. would love to hear what others think. most of the people in the theater were audibly confused, but i appreciate the poetry of it. moonee's story isn't over and we don't need to see how it ends",0.8378,104

"well said, your thoughts have given me a new perspective on the movie and indeed! i was hoping maybe a nomination for this film. When i first watched it with my parents, they thought the movie was harsh and the kids we're being influenced badly. maybe they're just old fashioned? but i hinted that the movie was about childhood and how Monee enjoyed her everyday life despite of her living in, i guess, poverty. overall the film was great, i just didn't get the ending.",0.75,96
