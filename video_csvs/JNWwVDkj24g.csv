"Destruction of Daisy and One Lunatic, One Icepick are both in effect, snuff films.  Depending on the definition you chose, either thousands, or only a handful of snuff films exist.  These two are only the most prolific.

The former was created for the purpose of sale and the latter for the sake of notoriety.  People are regularly killed on camera for the sake of ""entertainment"" but very rarely are murderers able to collect payment from these things, otherwise there would be no problem finding them.

Edit: Don't look up Destruction of Daisy.  Basically, it's probably the most famous CP/Hurtcore video on the planet and you're probably going to be put on a list just for reading this.

"Technically speaking, the deep web is comprised of hosted websites, not indexed by Google or other major search engines for whatever reason. As a web developer, I like to upload my work in progress sites to a secret, password protected directory on my website. Because I'm not allowing Google to find these directories, they are technically on the deep web. This also technically makes your emails, iCloud, personal banking, etc. part of the deep web because Google can't index that I.E. someone can't google ""Timmy's online bank account"" and have access to Timmy's online bank account. It is for this reason that the deep web is described as so big: it houses all of the private data of every user of the surface web.

The 'Dark Web' just refers to the corner of the deep web where really fucked up shit happens, like hitmen for hire, sex slave auctions, drug trade. You know; Wholesome Catholic stuff. These websites often require you to know someone who either runs the site or is a well-respected member and can invite you.

Marianas web is non-existant. If it does, the only thing deeper than the deep web is things that aren't on a file server. I guess in that sense, your own computer hard drive is part of the Marianas web lmao.",0.642,252
