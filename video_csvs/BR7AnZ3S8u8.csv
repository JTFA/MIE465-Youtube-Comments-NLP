"+42 jade Most people were like that, oh and I don't see you mentioning jack about the high murder rate in the US as well as abortion. Sex offenders especially rapists are the least to reoffend but people like you make it so they minus well have repeated their crime wile they were at it. 

You talk about what he may condone, yet you seem to condone repeat murderers more than none repeat rapists. Worse, society leans towards murder, which was and still is the most heinous and serious crime among humans. 

How exactly are you talking to him about morals, when killing another person is seen as a norm?",-0.9888,121

"+Phil McCracken 1. Does the husband get a say in the matter, I have read accounts of pissed off men who had their kid aborted for selfish reasons. 2. Unplanned in a marriage? Having unprotected sex? Either she marries or she doesn't, people don't marry to be celibate. 3. Are you suggesting it be a norm in families to kill kids? It is sad that a woman using abortion is the stereotype of not wanting to take care of a kid after not being careful. Even sadder, men involved with these women barely have a say and yet they are required in some way to help raise him or her. Either the man has a say or he doesn't.",-0.96,134
"+Phil McCracken Law, as in put in place, or a universal belief among humans. It is more common among animals, that is for the male ones to kill children that may not be theirs, over a mother killing her child out of starvation. 

If abortion is not rampant as you claim, and has not been amongst various humans I would think it to be unnatural.

Moses killed a man who was oppressing another man. Then to now murder and kill are two different things. There would be no Israelite soldiers in the bible if it was all murder, and there would be no soldiers today if it was murder instead of kill. People then to now knew the difference.

This is not an exception to the commandment for people who believe in the God of Israel (bible). To you and others it may appear as an irony, but it is not when looking closer, be use it was universal, even our laws today are not much different.

If the US code is only in effect for people who were born, then what about a double homicide when a pregnant woman and expected child are killed? People in the past treated matters like this very seriously.

Abortion I do believe is to terminate what is in action, such as, a woman who is pregnant terminating a devolving child before he or she is born.

Laws are either rights or against an activity. It use to be illegal to engage in such an act. Telling people which by the way their belief system did help influence these laws, just like other beliefs influenced other laws elsewhere in the world. Secularism does not drop the ethics of what is considered evil, they can try telling children it is ""ok"", but it will not sit well with people in killing their kid. 

An abortion is not much different than a parent dashing their kids on stones or leaving them for dead. Which in part has happen in the US, being known as child abuse. Late term abortions are even closer to old ways of killing kids. You mention about law, yet those very laws came from religious people who did not tolerate killing their own kids. Now all of a sudden it is ok. At what point do you see it illegal? The US is already having a challenge getting more people as Americans for the next generation. Like what about 50 million died to abortion, if it was gun violence this would have been a national problem. 

If you want to make child killing which it is, people who like to call children who are developing, a ""clump of cells"" forget, developed people are also and still a ""clump of cells"". So on what basis, do you perceived murder to be ok?

Mind you most people 3,000 years ago did not see killing their kids ok, nor do most do that today, or we as humans would be decreasing from that mess. People's morals and ethics then to now did not drop out the window, seeing this as ok. 

It is sad you are justifying what people actually see as murder, which again was and still is the most heinous crime to commit",-0.9988,603
"+Phil McCracken Murder, not kill, and killing a child from an expecting mother was looked down upon, so out of the blue, it is ok for a mother to kill her kid? Are there any ancient laws or modern laws saying it is ok  for a parent to kill their kid because they didn't want them and such?",0.9269,65
"+Shaima El Mabsouta Most taking viagra are for erectile dysfunction

The few not for erectile dysfunction are men and women taking it for things like a heart condition, I guess you are right, why pay for that? Compared to millions killing their kids out of free will (although the excuse of a small amount who had incest or were raped are used as justification for the majority).

You were saying something about birth control? Certain people like me just see the nation's population declining, and you justify something that will help the decrease

😑",-0.6072,103
"+Shaima El Mabsouta maybe because it is not guaranteed it will always prevent a pregnancy and getting off schedule what will the woman do?

When I think of the words ""birth control"" I think of more kids killed for said reasons than some sort of contraceptives being used. 😑 Rome had places of infant graveyards when people didn't want to have kids. 

Viagra was made in origin for cardiovascular persons and some other purpose, apparently it had several uses, there are attempts to make a female viagra. 

Like what op mentioned, viagra helps men use an organ of their body, that being the penis, to be able to have sex. Different groups of people had their their version, for example the Romans made a plant extinct using it as a male enhancement. 

Most women on birth control are not taking it out of need

The US needs more people as far as national populace, not less, to the point it is not sustainable, which it is now. Please explain how ""birth control"" helps future generations if we are possibly not likely to replace all of the last generation?",0.3093,210
"+tart70 Here's why the husband has limited rights. Reproductive rights exist. To the extent that men have reproductive capabilities, men have reproductive rights. Women have more reproductive capabilities, so they have more reproductive rights. Also please read my response to your comment in the other tread which explains why fetuses are not individuals, which I will now use to state that, since a man does not become a parent until he has offspring (meaning a born child) he has nothing to have parental rights over (and yes women therefore do not have parental rights until the child is born either). All I was suggesting with my comment was that it is not just whores who want to use birth control and want to have full control over their reproduction. Women, whether married or not, have a right to chose when and by whom they will reproduce. Conception is not a necessary effect of sex; even without contraception, sometimes conception happens, sometimes it doesn't. Whether wanted or not conception is a happenstance, an accident. Women should not lose reproductive rights simply because they happen to become pregnant. And no, women don't become married to be celibate, but just because someone is married doesn't mean they want to reproduce. There are many reasons why a woman should not wish to become pregnant--not just because they are irresponsibly promiscuous. So saying that 'those sluts need to keep their legs closed' overlooks the complexity of the issue.",-0.7578,276
"+tart70 Laws? Don't know, but animals have been known to eat their children if they are unable to feed them. So, abortion is not unknown in the natural world and therefore not unnatural. Law of the jungle? And I'm pretty sure that the Bible explicitly states that Moses murdered a man. And he was the one God used to tell the world that we shouldn't commit murder? The point I was making is that there are clearly exceptions to that Commandment. And by the way, U.S. code defines a ""human being,"" ""person,"" ""individual,"" and ""child"" as someone who is born alive. How can abortion be considered murder (homicide) if no human being, person, individual, or child is killed? And also, that's not the way laws work. All actions are presumed legal until made illegal, no law *permits* any action by an individual they only *prohibit* actions, so there would never be a law stating a parent can kill their child because that's not how laws operate.",-0.5615,208

In order for a zygote (fertilized egg) to exist, an egg must be fertilized by a sperm during sexual intercourse. This can only happen in the Fallopian tubes of a woman. The zygote then attaches itself to the muscle in the uterus and over the course of nine months, the zygote cell splits and forms a fetus. After nine months, the fully grown fetus, now called a baby, is given birth to by the mother either naturally through the opening of the vagina, or through a c-section.

"The Genovese owned S&A Concrete built the Trump Towers in Manhattan. Donald Trump used Roy Cohn as his attorney who also worked for former Genovese boss Tony Salerno, Gambino boss Carmine Galante, and John Gotti. Atlantic City is ran by the mafia and is where Trump built his casino. Donald Trump purchased the property for his casino from the mafia hitman Salvatore Testa. The Italian Mafia launder their personal profits through casinos and have run Atlantic City from its beginnings. Donald Trump is an associate of the Five Families in New York and Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV is a top owner of the Genovese crime family. The Savoy family has a Savoy-Genova branch and hold the title of Prince of Naples where Genovese crime boss Vito Genovese was from. Prince Roffredo Gaetani dated Ivana Trump and he is a hidden top owner of the Gambino crime family. Prince Roffredo Gaetani faked his death and is hiding out in Switzerland with Prince Vittorio. Prince Vittorio has been investigated for racketeering, corruption, and exploitation of prostitution as well as charged with murder in the past. It was the Savoy family that put the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in power. Atlantic City where Trump owned a casino is mostly controlled by the Philly Mob currently headed up by mafia boss Joey Merlino.

According to the 29-count indictment, the Genovese group infiltrated concrete companies to control the construction of high-rise buildings in Manhattan, including Trump Plaza. 

https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/07/30/1973-meet-donald-trump/

Two months later, Trump Management, represented by Roy M. Cohn, turned around and sued the United States government for $100 million (roughly $500 million in today’s terms), asserting that the charges were “irresponsible and baseless.”

http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/john-gotti-thug-kid-untouchable-boss-article-1.476181

Gotti was arrested after a year on the lam. His grateful bosses hired lawyer-fixer Roy Cohn to see what he could do, and Cohn could do a lot. He got the case knocked down to attempted manslaughter, and Gotti wound up doing less time for killing - two years - than he had done for a hijacking that involved $7,000 worth of women's dresses.

Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, the rough-talking, cigar-chomping boss of the Genovese crime family who rose from running numbers in East Harlem to rigging construction bids on Manhattan skyscrapers, died Monday night, Federal prison officials said yesterday.

People are still having kids. Lol 
It’s not like people who use birth control are preventing future generations. Women who truly don’t want to have kids take more extreme measures (like IUD). Birth control helps regulate periods (especially in younger women).

If a woman misses a day on her pills, she can always take something like Plan B.

What if a woman isn’t in the right situation to have a child? Sure, she can give the baby up for adoption, but the baby won’t be healthy if the mom didn’t have enough money to pay for hospital visits and the right prenatal care, etc.

You’re basically telling women if they don’t want to run the risk of getting pregnant to just stop having sex. How’s that logical?

Even married couples who HAVE KIDS might only want 1 or 2 kids because that’s all they can afford.
