"Hello Jemma, 

i decided to do the ""Alternative Double Chocolate Forest Fruit Christmas Cake recipe | Cupcake Jemma""
 for the birthday of my little girl 3years Old, so i did the chocolate cake 3 times, the first one, it was ruined, break in 3 side, i didn‚Äôt let it to become totally cold it‚Äô my fault, ( the taste really good ), so i repeated it 2 times for getting more layer; and in the all experiences , the cake wasn‚Äôt ready at 30min or 35 min in the middle at 175c¬∞ i let it up to 45min not ready at all, again i returned it back in convection oven for 10min, then it was ok, but the top was open like a the bread with knife.
what‚Äôs wrong?!! later i heard 10c¬∞ less :( 
please try to mention the method of heat and oven in the recipe ! 

next , -For the chocolate mascarpone filling: was missed when i added the melted and colded chocolate suddenly she freeze in the robot -For the white chocolate swiss meringue buttercream: white chocolate also missed when i added the melted and colded white chocolate in the robot ! 

How to fixe that Pleaseeee!!",0.4091,234

Jyoti Gupta that shouldn‚Äôt happen as long as you‚Äôre using gel food coloring. If it‚Äôs not gel try using gel. Gel normally after it sits gets darker not to much but definitely a couple shades. No matter which brand gel food coloring should always turn your frosting red,0.2263,57

You could take this one step further by actually measuring the cake and calculating how many dots you need for a complete pattern and then adjusting the size of the dots. Just a tip. That's what I do to make sure that the pattern is all lined up.,0.3182,51
