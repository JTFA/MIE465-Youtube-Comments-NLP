Why would a ""rational"" person not submit to a course of care prescribed by his/her superior when his doctor has given him/her both the costs and benefits of both compliance and non-compliance?

Analyze the above statement, and you will understand why this is the case, at least enough times to be worrying.

The trouble is that these courses of treatment offer the patient no immediate, tangible benefit, and by not submitting to treatment, the patient is not offered and immediate tangible risk.  You are counting on citizens doing mathematics which is well above their level of competence - in essence you are demanding that they trust their doctor, even if their doctor is not even competent in the math required to balance his/her chequebook. 

What happens if the patient follows the prescribed regimen?  Does he/she feel any better?  For the most part, no!  Is he annoyed at being ""forced"" to ""take his medicine""?  For the most part, yes!  Partly because he/she has to do something that he/she did not have to do before, but MAINLY because it is a remindrance of his/her weakness.

What happens if the patient goes off of the prescribed regimen?  Does he/she feel any worse?  For the most part, no!  But he/she does not have to take those damn pills.  (I know of what I speak.  My wife has MS.  She was prescribed Copaxine injections.  Over time, she could not see any benefit.  The injections did not make her feel better, and she still had MS attacks.  You could show her that the rate of attacks had slowed, but in her mind, that was not significant.  She finally stopped.  Did she go into a wheelchair immediately?  No!  As far as she could see, there was no difference between taking the drug and not taking the drug.  You could show her the statistics, but her eyes would glaze over, much like your (and my) eyes would glaze over if someone endeavoured to explain the math behind string theory.  Here you have a classic case of the costs and benefits are only accessible to the doctor, not the patient.)

Would you like a suggestion?  Those long term drugs that you want the patient to stay on?  Combine them with oxytocin.  At least your patient would get an immediate boost from taking it.",-0.8104,463

"And instead of just assuming behavior will be influenced by a given incentive (like, ""not dying""), they seek to be more empirical, almost as it if were really just social psychology applied to economic matters. It's even kind of wrong to say that ""behavioral economics aren't convincing"", since it's not like there's an unified underlying assumption that seems to have been falsified for medicine specifically. 

It's like psychology, it's hard to make people change their habits, and it will be rare that there will be an universal rule on how to do it, except if you include the possibility of an environment that highly constrains the behavior. When you add varied health conditions to the mix, some possibly affecting or comorbid with mood and even memory, things only get more complex.",-0.6611,150

For example, we tend to over estimate highly unlikely events (like plane crash) while underestimating likely events (like car crash).

Or we tend to be too hopeful when things are bad (hence rise of unproven ""alternative"" medicine, or people holding onto a falling stock), and the opposite when things are good (think of good relationships or people selling a winning stock too early).",0.5183,116

Imagine this: You've completed your medication run....and now you're out of your opiates. You feel like shit. And obviously, doctors, who get paid what's basically commission, will be more than willing to ""prescribe"" some more for...""well, let's see if we can't find something.""

"Hah!  I really meant it tongue in cheek than in practice.  I think it's even worse when you have a medication where the doctor doesn't even really know if it's going to work, but it's something to try (think something vague like chronic fatigue).  As I've gotten older and seen and dealt with much more complex medical issues than just a flu, I've learned that medicine is as much of a guess and an art as it is a science.  

I wonder how much could be changed by being more honest at the doctor's office.  Instead of the doctor just assuming the pills will be taken, talk to the patient about their routine, what to do if a dose is missed, how the medicine works (or might work), etc.  Using carrot & stick type approaches kind of misses the point, it would be better if the patient fundamentally felt different about treatment.

I'm sure there are exceptions to this... out there... somewhere... But I wonder how much noncompliance boils down to bad doctoring.

"If they're already spending a lot on medication, and not taking such medication, then they've already decided that the price of the medication isn't worth their time.

Obviously if they start taking the medication regularly, the price can revert back to it's normal price.
Also, if they can't take the medication by some other reason they cannot control, or they feel like they need a second opinion, they should tell the doctor and let them know, so the doctor isn't going to prescribe as much, or any medication.",-0.567,166

"One thing I've learned in pharmacy school is that patients are more likely to be compliant if you simply go to the trouble of counseling them on potential side effects and what to do if they experience them.  Patients are more likely to continue a medication in the face of a side effect if they were prepared for it, whereas if it catches them by surprise, they are more likely to stop completely.

I've seen this play out in real life.  My father-in-law was prescribed a medication, one which his health history makes him a good candidate for.  He got a well-known side effect, one that can be easily dealt with by a simple change in therapy.  But nobody ever told him about it ahead of time.  He wound up turning to Dr. Google to try to figure out what was wrong and decided on his own to discontinue his medication without talking to his doctor about it first, and since then he has refused any similar medication despite his doctor's recommendations.  He has his mind completely set against this particular drug therapy now, one which he really ought to be on, all because nobody ever told him ahead of time what might happen and what to do about it if it did.",0.1497,229

Yes. Let's blame patients. Not clinics that make it difficult to renew prescriptions and use them as a leash to force unnecessary return visits. Not insurance companies that won't give you more than 30 days of a drug at a time even when prescriptions are written for longer periods. Don't blame the insurers who charge arbitrarily high prices for some drugs and not others requiring the patient to wait for unnecessary prescription changes. Don't blame the pharmacies that intentionally fill the prescriptions slower so that you will stay in the store longer or their pharmacists who incessantly question every doctor's order and slow everytihng down.

And when you go see the doctor, there is usually a co-pay of some sort, it's never completely free (otherwise it can be abused)
