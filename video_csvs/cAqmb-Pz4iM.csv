1. No one ever wanted to hear about LaVar Ball every single day they wake up. ESPN just loves him too much.

Jesus died on the cross for us. He took our punishment upon Himself. And because of this, we are saved. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior by calling upon Him from the heart, and you will be saved. He will refresh, redeem and sustain you! He will also make a Way for us to escape the oncoming judgement heading for this earth. 

So friends, if you do not  know Jesus Christ, please make today the day you make Him Lord of your life. Time is very short, and our lives even shorter.

I get your point of view. But, what u don't get is that most blacks have a Lavar Ball in the family or friends. If not an acquaintance at the sports bar or barber shop.

From your writing I believe you understand where I'm coming from...",0.357,87
"Pety 
It does have to do with race although not wholly. People don't like Lavar because he's cocky, brash, and uncensored... Most interest is centered around his parenting choices. By far most or many white families have distaste for snatching the kids out of school. But, predominantly white sports like tennis , hockey, and golf young achievers do the same thing without chastisement... Therefore, I conclude the only difference is this is a black/Biracial family setting precedence in a predominantly minority sport. So it's ok for whites but not blacks is the point I touched on....  Think on that",0.1345,113

If he wants to be a starting PG he needs to completely change is shot and work with a shooting coach. Kawhi is a perfect example, he worked with chip from the Spurs staff and has an amazing shot, if lonzo can do that then he has a bright future but if he keeps those horrible numbers he's going to be a back up or out of the league in 3-4 years",0.586,148
