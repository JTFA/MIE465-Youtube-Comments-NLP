"15:23 to 16:50 - It was a celebration of Roger Federer’s career not just on winning the Australian Open.

It has been an honour to watch him play all these years. 

I still remember when the Federer-Nadal rivalry started, my dad stopped supporting Federer (for a while) not because he didn’t like him, but because he thought Federer was just too good and to him, Nadal was only his true competitor. He believed that tennis lacked competition not because of the players but because of him.

It was only after 7-8 years ago that he realised it’s not easy to find a champion like Roger. His style of play on the court, his character and personality off the court made him so loved by all of us. So he was basically saying like ‘Let’s just enjoy the moment and admit that he’s the GOAT’ lol.

Due to the reasons given in the above, we have established that if Nadal or any tennis player today overtakes Roger’s record number of grand slams, Federer will always remain the Greatest Player of All Time.",0.9949,211

I'm not even a Fed fan (scroll up a few comments and you'll see. Just like you, I respect all three of them) I get your points BUT as I said don't forget how old they are. Novak = 30 / Nadal = 31 // They've been dealing with lots of injuries. I love Nadal and he deserves more Grand Slams but he can't obtain this level as long as Federer.

And, the other users don't ignore what's in front of them. All they do is talk statistics and facts and recite other professionals who call Federer the GOAT. You can't ignore what's in front of you and that's cool but you also can't see in the future. The future is not predictable.",0.9532,173

"Danny Cooper ""Last time they played in a slam and Nadal wasn't 100""
Dude, he was 100% fit at the Australian Open. Even he said that.

Also, for crying out loud, please make use of some punctuation or at least learn to structure your answers well so that it isn't a pain in the ass for someone to read it (given that the contents of your answers are pretty much that)",0.6126,81
"Danny Cooper Another answer based on subjective views. Smh. While it is true that peak level Novak played at the highest level ever, his physicality played a huge role in it, and that is going to decline with time. Now, instead of writing 5 or 6 trite responses everywhere, why not construct one meaningful answer that actually makes use of concrete and hard data rather than this garbage you are subjecting us to?",0.5327,81
Danny Cooper Djokovic beat Federer in the 2008 and 2011 and 2016 australian open semis. Federer had mononucleosis at the start of 2008 and anyways his prime had ended by 2007. Duh.,0.0,35
"Danny Cooper Do you have a counterargument to Nadal's 16 being better than Federer's 20?

Mate, I suppose you should ask yourself this, ""Can you statistically prove that that Nadal's 16 is greater than Federer's 20?"" Because unless you point out a way to quantify competition in the grand slam count, the only thing you can say is that, ""Nadal/Novak faced better competition"" which is highly unscientific. So the actual onus should be on you to mathematically prove that Rafa's 16 or Novak's 12 is greater than Federer's 20. 


But why is Federer's 20 better? (Since you probably don't have the intelligence to come up with a system of your own) Here is why:


First for competition: It isn't Federer's fault that he was born 5 years earlier. He can only face the opponents he does face. 


Now Nadal's 16: Fucking 10 out of Nadal's 16 slams have come from RG!! That is nearly 2/3rd or 64%! In comparison, Novak's best slam accounts for 50% (6/12) of his slam total, and Federer's best slam accounts for 40% of his total. Also, as I have pointed out earlier, Nadal has NEVER successfully defended a slam outside of clay. How can the greatest of all time be a player who have only ever truly dominated in one slam? That isn't to say that Nadal can only play well on clay, he has proven otherwise, but still the overreliance on only 1 slam is not a GOAT like attribute.


Now over to Djokovic, (who is now so far behind Fed, he would need his coach Agassi's slams to draw level 😂😂). But jokes aside, yes, Novak has probably played the best set of players to win his slams. But there are caveats to that too. His first slam came against a Tsonga who was at the time unseeded. 3 of his slams have come against an old Federer (2014 and 2015). 5 of his wins came against Andy Murray, (no disrespect to him, but even post prime Federer best him in 3 finals in 2008, 2010 and 2012). 


Also worth noting, both Nadal and Novak have won more than 5 times at just on slam. Federer has done it in 3 slams.


Federer has 




The bottomline is that the onus is on someone like you to statistically prove that Nadal's or Djokovic's slam count is greater than Federer's by coming up with a metric system that does so, because by conventional logic Federer's count is the greatest and that is that.

Also, I have broken down the Fed-Novak head to head by dividinf their matchups into 3 different timelines, which you have failed to respond to.

I have listed the advantage Nadal has by shedding light on the no of times the 2 have played on clay vs grass.

Also, all time greats opinions (>)^100  your opinion.

""Objectively speaking, Nadal's and Djokovic's game is better""
Now where is the scientific analysis on that? You do realize that something doesn't become objective just because you say so? Or wait, you probably just learnt it somewhere and thought it sounds cool..",0.9907,599
Danny Cooper If Fed is overrated well they should have prevented him from winning more titles. Lol Nadal and Novak are great players and much younger but they cannot even stop old Fed. Old Fed just overwhelmed the no.1 player last year and he will do the same this year only if they refused to lose in earlier rounds. Hahaha,0.8211,65
"Danny Cooper Lol you are just a cry baby since your Nadal and Novak cannot win GS Titles anymore. They better play more ATP 250 tournaments to have a better chances of winning titles again. Hahaha Meanwhile, the GOAT Fed is on the way to grab more GS, Masters 1000, ATP Finals titles and close to being world no.1 again. Lol",0.9374,69
"Danny Cooper Mate, the highest no of slams any player has ever won over the age of 30 is around 5-6. I think you don't seem to have any respect for how hard it is for these guys to win slams and just assume that they can produce these performances forever. Rest assured, Djokovic would do well to hit 15, and Rafa would do well to win a couple of more French Opens. 
But 22-25. Have to laugh. Like really hard.",0.9726,90
Danny Cooper Nadal will win at least 20 and djokovic will probably end up with the most? Wow! That's a very nice dream from a retarded fanboy. Hahaha Lol,0.9456,32
Danny Cooper Well that's tennis you win some and you lose some and It was clearly past prime 34 year old Federer against prime 28 year old Novak at his best season so it's no surprising if Novak can win some. However what's amazing old Fed was the only one challenging him in several tournaments with some are in close matches and did win some titles against the best version of Novak in 2015. If old Fed can win titles against the best version of Novak just imagine how many more beatings he could do against Novak at his best version in 2006 prime Federer. Lol,0.9919,109

"I love all the people that are saying he is ""the greatest ever"". He dosn't touch Nadal and Djokovic, if he was born in 86 or 87, playing alongside Rafa and Nole in their primes....he would have 8-10 AT MOST. It's funny because Nadal and Djokovic will pass him ANYWAY. He is very good, but he is not as good as his titles show, not even close, the level of competition that Nadal played against, and especially Djokovic, compared to Federers competition, it's almost not even close. I look back at some of Feds early semifinals and finals and I go, ""Who?"" Lololol! Again my point is that Nadals and Djokovics level of competition is soooo much better than Feds, and if Fed was the same age....I don't know if he EVER beats Nadal. Maaayyybe Djokovic a few times, but ultimately they are both simply better than him in terms of their game. If you look at all 3, not looking at titles, Djokovic has the best all around game, so in a way he is the greatest, and Nadal is just barely right behind him, and then Fed.

"Ishaan Sati Statistics? LMFAO! Did you not see my last comment? 😂😂😂😂 OMG you've just resorted to spewing random words to hide the fact that you have no counter argument to the truth that I presented. Do you have a counter argument to Nadals 16 being better than Federers 20? Also everyone single one of Djokovics 12 had him play at least one or sometimes 2 of the other big 4? Wheres Fed at times played guys outside of the top 20 in finals. Hell look at his last two, cilic injured in 17 Wimbledon, this one Fed played nobody until the final, and in Wimbledon his best competition was berdych (lol). Soooo I'm just here waiting for the counter argument to all of that.....wanna know why I won't get one? Because it dosn't exist. Here's the thing about most ""arguments"", number one most people can't argue for shit, they get angry and emotional and there is a ton of bias involved. Then there are arguments where there arw subjective opinions, and other ones where there are straight facts....in other words not an argument because there's nothing to argue. So I only argue if i know that I am absolutely right. That is the case with this argument. When I say that Nadal played against better competition, and that because of that his slams hold more volume to them, despite having less than Fed...I don't really know what there is to argue there...lol. But of course at that point bias, favoritism, and anger and emotions come into play. Fed fans can't stand that Nadal is better, and they know it, so they just come up with random crap, same for Djokovic. Objectively speaking, in terms if their game, Novak and Rafa are better, even without the stiffer slams argument, and it shows when they play. Last year was the first time in years that Fed beat Nadal, and that was barely against Nadal not being 100, before that Nadal dominated him.....honestly it was as if every time before they played everyone knew the outcome, same with Djokovic as soon as Djokovic started winning titles.",0.9647,409
"Ishaan Sati You again? Lololol scientifically prove? Ahahahaha! There is no scientific proof there is facts. You said it's not Feds fault that he was born 5 years earlier, lolol that is not my point, you're right, he played who was in front of him, but that dosn't change the fact that who Nadal played in front of him, and especially Djokovic, were BETTER.....is that finally starting to click? Lol! Novak played Fed when he was old? Ahahahaha! Gtfo well then Fed played Djokovic and beat him twice 07 and 08 us when Djokovic was young and didn't realize that he had siliac disease....you see how I can make up excuses as well? Lolol! Djokovic is simply better than Fed, THAT is why he beat him, not because he was old lololol pathetic. Again Nadals 16 had so much better competition, and Djokovics 12 had even more competition. I love how you brought up Novaks first slam, hey guess what, number 1, he played Fed in the semifinal.....yeaa...lololol number 2, Fed and Nadal also played not so great players in their first final....lololol does all of this finally make sense? Of course it dosn't because your bias makes it almost impossible for you to see the truth.....so in a way it's not your fault.....so it's all good lol. Nonetheless I had to show you how wrong you are. It's all good though all 3 are the best, just Nadal and Djokovic are a little bit better.",0.9937,290

You can be stuck in your bias and delusion all you want. I'm actually curios if it's about simply winning titles, or staying at the top in terms of number of titles for Fed, because if it's about staying at the top his heart will be shattered very soon....twice lol.",-0.6043,106
MarvelCU No point in responding to this guy. He seems like a troll to me.,0.0772,17
"MarvelCU Your username is fitting because I truly do MARVEL at your original comment. ""Head to head is overrated."".....I mean do you just choose to forget or are you that deluded? Nadal smashing Fed for years is overrated? Nole beating him multiple times is overrated? This is all predicated by the results of one tournament where they were both injured? Damn your logic makes my head hurt lol!",-0.5297,79
"Mila Lev Ahahaha another butthurt fed fan, let it go? I made the original comment. If? Lololol that's what all of these Fed fans have been saying, I'm just stating facts not ifs, that's what my original comment was. I actually at one point even said that these Fed fans should just stick with Fed having the most titles, instead of trying to counter-argue my comment with delusions. I say again, I'm not taking anything away from Federer, 20 is 20 and it is amazing, THE ONLY THING that I am saying, or have been trying to say rather, is that Nadals 16, is a little more amazing because of the competition that he had to play against, Djokovic isn't quite there yet because 12-20 is still a spread but if he wins a few more it's the same for him....I don't know what part of that dosn't make any sense.....it does make sense, it's just that Fed fans know that it makes sense, and they are so prideful of their favorite player, so they have to counter it with delusions. But maybe it's my fault, my original comment did seem a bit snarky now that I look back at it. One of the reasons why I worded my comment like that, maybe, is because people ARE very snarky with these sports debates, and naturally very biased. I was only being snarky but not biased, only objective. I have actually been following Fed for longer and am a fan of him, I'm a fan of all 3, but over the years as I'v seen what Nadal and Djokovic have done, and who they have done it against....I can't ignore what's in front of me....I'm just stating facts, lol calm down Fed fans.",0.9827,333
