I grew up at the age of 5, getting an Atari 2600 at Christmas, then a NES, then a SNES, N64, PS1, DC, etc etc.  I'm now 38, and I'm very jaded at what is allowed to be the ""norm"" in gaming today.

This is a bunch of crap. If you dont want loot boxes don't buy them. If you think you have to have something that might be in them to be competitive then you are wrong. Anyone can be good at a game without stuff contained in the loot boxes. So stop associating loot boxes with derogatory words and comments. Play the game and stop attacking it or don't play it. Period end of story. Loot boxes aren't life or death. As far as kids go if you dont want them to buy loot boxes then monitor what you allow them to play and don't let them buy anything. I have 4 kids and 2 of them as well as my wife and I are serious gamers. All of us are completely content and capable of playing games without spending additional money for in game loot boxes or anything like that. If we can do that and pay attention to the 2 kids we have that are too young (1 and 2 years old) for gaming and play games just fine and not put extra money into games then what is everyone elses excuse. It can be controlled and monitored by parents. It can be done. END RANT... POINT PROVEN.,0.1209,227

In casino gambling
U got small chances to win real money

In game loot box??
U pay real money to win nothing

"You sir are a modern day hero in helping us stand up to the gaming industry as they continue to take advantage of not only gamers, but their parents, children and vulnerable people who do not understand how much they are spending on digital content. We know of so many people in debt because of these practices and especially in the games of Madden and Fifa Ultimate Team modes where the next year version is released and the $500+ you spent on the previous year is then worthless as you have to start again. When a gaming company releases a game, it should be a complete game with everything included as is why we pay a full price of $60. If a game was free to play, then we would accept micro transactions. 
There are children who spend all of their birthday money, christmas money and even borrowed money on loot boxes and micro transactions which is unbelievably being tolerated by the government and being push further forward by the game publishers. This does not apply to all publishers, but especially EA and Activision.
We now get half finished games that require constant updates, requirements of loot boxes and micro transactions and season passes only so we can continue to play with other players online which then creates a massively unbalanced game as it is not a level playing field. I feel at times that we need a gaming crash like the age of Atari in the late 70's and early 80's so that the gaming industry will realise that it needs to change back to how it has been from 1990 to 2010. 
Digital games also need to be accounted for, as you do not have a hard copy of the game and the publisher can and does one day close the servers to that game and content so what you paid for now means nothing once more. If you purchase a digital game, you should be sent out the hard copy for it as you pay the same price online as you would in store, but you have no tangible asset on a digital sale. With music and movies you always have those as they never change, but games get removed when they are no longer selling well online. Thank you",0.9136,412

"as annoyed as i am at EA the only defence i have for them is.
in the video's you say that there marketing the lootbox gambling to kids. but the games that have them are rated m games.
kids shouldn't be playing rated m games, kids shouldn't even be able to buy rated m games.
if they are then its the fault of the parents not the dev. 

the dev was just making a game based on gambling for adults.
the rest tho i mean the whole loot box in games that are already full price in general i frown heavily upon tho.",-0.7217,111
