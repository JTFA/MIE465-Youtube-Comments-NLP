"""they‚Äôre too stupid to understand and are brainwashed."" Really? This is the predominant democrat mantra regarding minorities. Democrats victimize minorities by subjecting them to oppressive stereotyping and stigmatization. You really think perpetuating myths of institutional and economic oppression is healthy for minorities? You really think pitting black against white is healthy for these communities? Funny that democrats have never achieved a single thing in their entire history for minorities. That's just a fact bro.

""the party of slavery, segregation, and secession"" It is a matter of historical record as to which party is and has been the party of ""slavery, segregation, and secession"". Even to this day the democrats push for racial ""division, segregation and secession."" Examples?
Division: The democrat platform is based on identity politics. Identity politics by nature is corrosive and divisive.
Segregation: The democrats openly support minority only ""safe spaces""
Secession: When Trump won the 2016 election there were calls from democrat states to leave the union.
These are just some example and I'll happily inundate you with more if you like.

""Liberals don‚Äôt need to apologize for the Confederacy"" The democrats are NOT liberals. Period. In no way whatsoever could the democrats be described as ""liberal"".

Sorry there was indeed a good film in here trying to get out but it didn't succeed.  The shoot-outs especially the first and the one at the camp site were not believable.  In the first shoot out the male told his daughter to get away from the door (so she would not get shot) and then his next action was to leave the cover over the cabin and run towards the 6-8 hostiles with his Winchester.  Made no sense at all.  Compare it with The Searchers cabin scene.  The other shoot outs were not how trained (and they were meant to have significant experience in Indian Wars) soldiers would have acted.  Trained people would not have used their revolvers in preference to their repeating rifles.  The oft told story is the purpose of the revolver is to get you to your rifle.  OK if you were stuck with the Springfield single shot then I'd hang on to my revolver but Bale had a Winchester and in .44-40 that would ahve given him something like 13-15 shots versus the 6 from his Colt.

"Talking to you is like talking to someone who just popped out of the womb yesterday. 
Bro listen. I'm going to explain something to you so take it seriously, because it is true.. no mess. The left are today and historically authoritarian statists. The Nazi party were left-wing, their policies were left-wing, their political philosophy was left-wing and in case anyone was confused they called themselves National *socialists* (Nazis) ie German Socialists. Benito Mussolini was the founder of Fascism. Mussolini was a socialist his entire life. The Fascist party policies were left-wing, their political philosophy was left-wing and in case anyone was confused the word ""Fascism"" means ""bundle of sticks"" ie a collective. The Fascist manifesto is a left-wing document. Antifa are fascists. When the party and government gets so big their is no need for politics anymore. Left-wing ideology breeds authoritarian governments. Communism and socialism are left-wing ideologies. Stalin was left-wing. Every dictator on planet earth is left-wing. Left-wing ideology is anti-democratic and authoritarian. Why do you think democrats use divisive rhetoric and identity politics? Why do you think they call for bigger government and more control of institutions? Why do you think democrats try to interfere with the workings of society, culture, people and business?

The left and democrats are not Liberals. Liberals do not play identity politics or call for big government. Liberals do not infringe on free speech and individual rights. Liberals are not collectivist. Liberals do not attribute beliefs (political or other) to groups of people based on race or identity.
Republicans and conservatives have more claim to the label ""Liberal"" both historically and in action and policy and philosophy. They also have more claim to the label ""conservative"" because although they are Liberals (classical liberals) they also want to preserve society and liberty from statist encroachment and authoritarianism. 

""Socialism and communism are on the same side"" lol no bro. That's not how it works. Ideologically they're on the ""same-side"" but communism devours socialism every-time. There are no socialists in communist countries. The only place socialist and communists can survive outside of their utopias (if they have one) is in the west who still to this day are for the most part ""liberal conservative"" and right-wing.

The Republicans of history were conservatives by any standard of measure. Republicans are classical liberals. ""The north"" votes republican in huge numbers to this day.
This map shows states with elected republican governors. http://alumn.us/map-of-governors-in-us.html#
If this doesn't put your ""liberal north"" dribble to sleep then nothing will and I can only take it that your not acting in good faith or a just a plain ol' democrat bigot.

The statement ""Conservatives are ultimately responsible for slavery, segregation, and secession"" is an ahistorical statement. The statement ""The Democratic party are responsible for slavery, segregation, and secession"" is a true statement. The statement ""Republicans are responsible for EVERY advancement in US civil-rights"" is a true statement. The democrats are not liberals, republicans are the closest thing in US politics to the definition of ""liberal"". Hilary Clinton was a neo-con. David Duke ran for the Democratic presidential primaries in 1988.

And if you think your culture came from the Greeks, you'll have to acknowledge that it was actually the Persians and Arabs who preserved Greek works and then later gave them to Europe. And the Greeks learned an awful lot form the Arabs and Persians, who also took much of their culture from the Indians and Chinese.

The right wing KKK has supported every Republican candidate since at least Reagan. Shit, even conservatives know how retarded it sounds to call the KKK left wing.

We are acting in your best interests, you‚Äôre just too stupid to see it!‚Äù Great messaging, I‚Äôm sure it will get you more votes!

The truth is minorities and the Klan have acted off of your actions, not rhetoric. They see you are the party of slavery, segregation, and secession. Liberals don‚Äôt need to apologize for the Confederacy because we didn‚Äôt take up arms against our country, Southern conservatives did. You proved that once again defending that flag.

As far as Robert Byrd goes in this standard Republican talking point, Byrd was a Southerner and FORMER Klansman who reformed himself. All current Klansman vote Republican and have done so solidly since Reagan. Good job cherry picking a Klansman from 60 years ago though!

""The right wing KKK"" First off: The KKK are not ""right-wing"". Second off: Republicans have ALWAYS been against the KKK. Third off: Democrats founded the KKK and some of those people were members of the democrat party until the 2000's. Forth off: No republican has EVER been in the KKK. Fifth off: The KKK are now neo-nazis. Sixth off: Nazis are left-wing NOT right-wing. ""National Socialism (Nazi) is a left-wing ideology which advocates for state control of industry and commerce. The clue is in the name National *Socialism*. Fascism is a left-wing ideology founded by a radical socialist from Italy. Fascism is directly opposed to Republican ideals and right-wing ideology in general. Fascism advocates for state control of industry and commerce = left-wing ideology. The reason you (and most people) believe demonstrable historical falsehoods is because of the great democrat/ left-wing lie propagated by monopolizing control of educational institutions and media.

""When Michael Steele says that Republicans used identity politics to win over white southerners you‚Äôve lost the argument."" Ehhh no, it means that the democrat lie is so pervasive in the black community that it even effects black Republicans. There is yet to be a shred of evidence of any Republican activity pushing a devise racial strategy during the period of the so called ""southern strategy"".",0.8617,395

The ONLY reason that the European TRIBE became dominant in this country is because all of the Indian tribes waged war against each other.  There was NO native American Nation! Why was Bloody Knife riding with Custer you revisionists shits who enjoy the benefits of the nation our Settlers built?  Because Bloody knife was a Crow Indian and the Sioux stole the Crow lands.

When I give you an answer how about you debunk that answer instead of repeating the question lol fkn low IQ. Again, repeating questions and ignoring the answer is not an answer.
""why is it that blacks and minorities don‚Äôt vote Republican anymore?"" First off that's not true. Second off it's because since the 1960's the democrats have been waging psychological warfare on people of color and smear campaigns against Republicans. Dumbocrats evolved their racist politics into an oppressive mind forged manacle by imposing a victim mentally on people of color and creating conditions for a total reliance on government handouts while offering nothing but platitudes. They mask their racist politics behind social justice, identity politics, handouts, misdirection and historical revisionism. Their methods boil down to psychological/ emotional abuse and stoking racial divisions while holding themselves up as the saviors to a problem they created.... but of course they never NEVER fix anything which is why they've been enabling high crime, poverty, drugs and violence in minority areas for decades. It's why they teach people of color in nearly every school and university that they're perpetual victims and why 99% of Americans think Republicans were the Confederates. Black voters vote against their own interests when they vote democrats. Dumbocrats don't care about black voters, they ONLY care about their votes. Nothing more, nothing less. Period.

""Why is it that a former head of the RNC apologized to the NAACP for employing the Southern strategy?"" At least republicans are big enough to admit mistakes. When will the dumbocrats be apologizing for the confederacy? founding the KKK? Robert Byrd and the dozens of democrats like him? Opposing the civil rights act? Creating and implementing the Jim Crow laws? Or how about exploiting racial division in every election they've ever participated in? Oh right, that would shatter the great lie that Republicans are the racist party. Shame the facts don't fit the narrative. Funny this so called Southern strategy has precisely zero evidence of ever taking-place isn't it? Should be easy right? Show me one speech from a republican during this time who made ANY comments abut race or racial segregation or appealed to voters on racial grounds. Should be easy bro.
The REALITY is as the south became LESS racist the MORE they moved republican. There is a direct correlation between the sharp decline in racism in the south and the rise in Republican support. And *remember* bro (because it's a FACT) the Democrats at this time openly talked about being the party of racism. Funny they lost support as racism declined.

""conservatives (modern day Republicans) in the South who supported repealing parts of the Civil Rights Act"" That is a blatant lie. If youre going to make outlandish claims then prove it. You're not doing yourself any favors.

""hard ons for displaying the Confederate flag"" I think you'll find the confederate flag is popular with everyone from the south whether they're democrat, republican, black or white. Maybe you're just a bigot with a stupid and false stereotype of southern people.
