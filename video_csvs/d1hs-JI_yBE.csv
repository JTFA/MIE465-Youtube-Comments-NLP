My favorite Kobe moment was the night he tore his Achilles. Knowing full well his career would likely never be the same. He sank two free throws and walked off the court on his own two feet.

He’s the toughest athlete I’ve ever seen.

You know I didn’t notice it until tonight but I saw an episode of jimmy Kimmel where Kobe Bryant was a guest on the show. And Kobe‘s biggest influence for his basketball career was not only Michael Jordan but the great magic Johnson and his most influential was Magic Johnson. Isn’t it surprising but fitting that in Kobe‘s 20 year quest to be one of the greatest players in NBA history had both of his numbers retired. But not only did he have those numbers retired  but if you think of the jersey # 24 and the Jersey # 8 they total 32 which was Magic’s #. Pretty amazing,0.9847,123
