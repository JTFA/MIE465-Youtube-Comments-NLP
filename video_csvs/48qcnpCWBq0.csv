"The reason this song came about is because she tried to get an idea across to the producers but they had their faces in their phones.  Thus, these words are the same as stop and smell the roses.  Sad that cell phones have become an addiction and no one pays attention to what goes on around them.  Her songs with profound lyrics touch many people in all walks of life.
