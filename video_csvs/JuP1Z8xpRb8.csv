Andreas Vajda check the YouTuber Bradlee Wanamaker. He is a good singer as well and he doesn’t hide the fact that he loves Adams music. After seeing him you will see a difference with Brian,0.7906,39
Andreas Vajda their voices are the same lol,0.4215,8
Andreas Vajda they’re friends so I wouldn’t be surprised if Adam had some influence/help on lyrics or premise for the song. I can imagine Adam heard it before it was out and put some input on the song,0.6444,45
Andreas Vajda you are right in one thing. They do sound kinda alike. And don’t get me wrong I adore Adam with my heart. But Brian is different. I know which kind of music Adam released after Idol and it is not the same as Brian’s. As well as the meaning Brian puts behind his songs is much more powerful than Adams. And I repeat I am not saying that Adam has bad music. No. He is a great singer as well. But different.,0.7346,98

First I love the voice, I  have since AGT. But this video is trash. I can see Miley Cyrus doing this video! Put Wrecking Ball & this video together and they would tie for trash video's of the year. Come on Brian, please do video's to be proud of. Trash doesn't sell, But your Voice does! It may not sound like it, but I do love you and your music career!!!

You remind me of a Bowie character of the late 70's looking for your groove. I hope you continue to search and just like my taste's of Bowies past characters, there were some I didn't connect with and some I did. I hope your career continues to be stellar. Awesome voice Brian... awesome. I'm just one guy with my own opinion, I'm sure there are a lot out there that think mines crap... and that's ok.",0.9738,127
