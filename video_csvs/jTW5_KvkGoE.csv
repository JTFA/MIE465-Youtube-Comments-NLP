"I'm a little disappointed that he didn't have Lil Peep in the list here, going through his 'Top (#) Xtitle' videos right now. 

Gym Class by Lil Peep definitely hit me extremely hard this year. and it's interesting because I've listened to it the first a couple days ago, and even after his death I just now started getting into his music. 

'Gym Class's vocal Melody is one of the most nostalgic, Beautiful, heart pounding and even emotional I've heard in rap all year. I'm a little saddened that I just now found the song. But, it will definitely leave a mark in 2017, and in Lil Peeps career. Even though he is gone. 

Again, really sad to see Anthony didn't put this song on the list.",-0.1082,147

"Ok, i understand that it's personal opinion and it sorta kinda depends on popularity as well, but seriously? U put that Gucci shit of a song that has no thought behind it, no meaning, just pure and utter show-offness, a song that is only great to put on repeat if u wanna be brain dead after the first few listens, and meanwhile you have artist like Joey, Logic and J.Cole, who released not only fire singles, but honestly one of the best rap albums in a while. I truly had some respect for you and your words, but honestly after hearing mention of Cardi-B and Lil I don't even know his full stage name because him and his listeners have IQs under 0, I just skipped every single thing you said, just so I'd see if you put Kendrick in here, which was sort of an relief(and yes, element, fear and lust are all better once you get past the hype behind humble).",0.9717,184

Edit: best album of the year Litmas obviously.",0.5279,44
Pure Comedy is a snoozefest. What should I expect from someone though who put Gucci Gang in their top 50 and went on a rant about how segregation was the best thing ever.,0.7269,35
Putting Gucci gang on the list discredits the entire list,0.0,10
Really? Gucci gang? Are you retarded? That is by far the worst Song of 2017. Jesus you have just no clue what you are talking about,-0.8895,30
