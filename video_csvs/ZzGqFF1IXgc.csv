"As far as the leftover chicken goes in the fridge, I've been taught the saying ""when in doubt, throw it out"". If you think it smells funky or just a little old, your better off tossing it instead of using it and either getting an upset stomach or sometimes worse. I know it sucks throwing away food, and I've unfortunately done it plenty of times myself, but it's better to be safe, than sorry. It also helps to have your range hood fans running while cooking on the stove. It helps with removing smoke and heat in the air. If that's still not enough, crack open a window or slider door to circulate the airflow, and if needed, cook on a lower heat setting on the stove. Just some tips. After dealing with a couple of my own smoke detectors going off I made sure to do what I could so that I don't have to deal with them going off, and it helps with being able to see and breathe.",0.9148,191
