"2012 - 2016: Every Winter throughout my Highschool life

- Mom drops me off at the side of the building
- take a nice walk in the beautiful snow wearing warm layers, hat and scarf
- see a bunch of students dressed similarly 
- one gangsta looking fuck gets out of the car with a white tank top and cargo shorts lower than they should be
- he walks close by to students, purposely taking his time to get inside
- ""Who the fuck is this idiot?""
- We all finally get inside
- Gucci fucker gets inside and puts on his coat
- ""...why""
