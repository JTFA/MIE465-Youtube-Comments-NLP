"""I remove you with a cleft"" is now one of my favorite lyrical lines! Succinct and genius. Also, I feel you. Music has always been there for me to help heal, console, and to reenergize. Sending you happy vibes! Remember the days of Bun Bun!! :D",0.9393,58

"Hi Tessa, I just wanna thank you for what are you doing in this platform. I've recently discovered your videos and the introspection, vulnerability, positivity and serenity you put in them helped me trying again to work for a better mindset about what surrounds me and myself too. I really needed all of that in this period. 
I wish you the best from the future.

The whole of this song, the lyrics, the sounds, the video, are really quite something. I see you creating that cleft in the video and the description even as you give us this beautiful, beautiful piece of vulnerability. And I see the way you set it up also puts the person watching in the same place, just behind the camera, that you are in your bed. I hope you know that some us listen to these on repeat and wish you something whole and known, wish you the strength and courage to receive love and to reach out, and then wish ourselves the same.

Sending love, Tessa",0.9898,176

"The reason we like it is because we think it is true. 
The reason we think it is true is because we have experienced it ourselves.

Imagine that: everyone on the planet, knowing that they are lonely. One would think, with so much in common, that we would be able to touch someone to assuage that feeling. I imagine that some of you do. Sometimes.

So, thank you again Tessa for the reminder that even if we feel lonely, we have company in the many others who feel the same way.",0.7501,104

"You know, Tessa ... it's so obvious that you yearn for a man to love you (no, you're not a lesbian, forget about that). 
But all of these ""I'm not over you""-songs just displayed that you need a guy who puts you in your place. Who will NOT put up with your BULLSHIT! 
BULLSHIT! 
I'm serious. You've been claiming for too long that you are shtrong and independent and crap. But you're not over that guy because he tells you like it is. He's not susceptive for your frequent emotional bullshit. 
My heartfelt advice: cut the CRAP. And ... SUBMIT! Bear the swinishness ...or else you will end up a cat lady. 
Respected by feminazis, but unfucked and miserable. 
You might think I'm evil, but I got your best interests at heart. You're a true artist. You are. It's painful to see you castigate yourself.
