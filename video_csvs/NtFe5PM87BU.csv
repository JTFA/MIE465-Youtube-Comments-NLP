Gravelblock .101 I guess I'm saying the Viking catch didn't matter much because they got killed the next week. Not like they won to get to the the Super Bowl in the last second. The eagles play happened in the Super Bowl and it was a key play to help win the Superbowl. That has more impact. The Viking play didn't win them any conference or world championships. See the difference? If that's the case then the sack/fumble on Brady should have been number one cause it won them the super bowl.,0.9891,102
Gravelblock .101 but no championship. Eagles play helped them win it all. Diggs play just had them playing one more week. That's the difference.,0.9398,29
