"Angelica Reilly It might have been successful for her, but it wasn't done good enough to be credited as a successful attempt. As I said, rotation is not the only thing that matters, its landing is also important. Josef Sabovcik landed the first quad toe in competition but ISU examined it and deemed it two footed, although fully rotated, so it is not regocnized as the first quad toe. Andrei Krasnozhon was actually the first skater to land a quad Loop, but ISU didn't recognizes it as the first quad Loop, since the landing was messy and the judges overlooked it was UR. I believe Mirai can land a fully rotated triple Axel with a clean landing in competition, but she hasn't done it yet.",0.8818,138
"Angelica Reilly She landed it with two feet and received negative GOE, so it still doesn't count. I'm not sure if the ISU needs to officially regocnize she landed it, but I'll wait until she lands it rotated with positive GOE and good landing.",0.7857,48
"Angelica Reilly Who cares if it was not UR when the landing wasn't clean? Fully rotated doesn't equal clean jump. ISU didn't recognize first quad attempt because it was two-footed.

Don't get me wrong.  It's a beautiful jump.  Midori's 3A was hardly effortless but it was the most exciting jump I think I've ever seen (man or woman).  Mirai is solid and muscular and not tiny so the jump has a certain excitement and power to it.  Kind of like the difference between Boitano and Orser.  Orser was effortless and catlike and spun very fast in the air.  Boitano muscled his jumps up into the air.  I found that more exciting.,0.9772,91

I disagree and shes rarely been downgraded for prerotation (usually underrotation at the ending of the jump). And lmao at the consistency comment, she may not have a 100% success rate but she has accomplished the jump wayyy more than any other lady in history. Midori landed less than 6 in competition, mao had more than 4 times that many. Im a huge fan of midoris axel, but to talk about maos like that is hilarious",0.9528,144

"Who cares? The most important thing in a jump is to make the full rotation. Two-foot gets negative GOE, yes but 2ft does not equal not having landed a triple axel if it was fully rotated....She completed 3 and a half revolutions in the air and did not fall. That is a triple axel. Step out, two foot, etc. fine. It's not ideal, but as long as you get the 3.5 revs and don't fall you have landed that jump. It counts. She received full base value. She just got minuses. She got many more points for it than if she would have completed a perfect +3 GOE double axel and to me, that is a successful triple axel.",0.9317,138

If anything, Mirai's entire jump and landing are very delicate, which seems to make it easy for her to fall. She's not thick and strong with muscle like Tonya was, and it makes her falls look worse, in my opinion.

"she was never downgraded because she fulfilled the requirement for not pre rotating more than 1/2 turn on ice. axel allows you to pre rotate 1/2 and underrotate 1/4 turn, allowing a skater to only rotate 2&1/4 in air in conclusion. i'm not saying her axel is horrible and needs to be downgraded, it's just that she knows that rule and because of that rule, she always pre rotated (literally pre rotated, i'm not saying she needs to be downgraded because like i said, she still met the requirement) 1/2 on ice and the rest in air. most skaters only pre rotate about 1/4 turn for an axel (because you kinda have to and that is why axel allows you to pre rotate more than other jumps) but mao turns 1/2 on ice so she can only rotate 3 in air. if you look at slow mo of other skaters, they pre rotate a bout 1/4 in which only the front toe pick is on the ice at the end of 1/4 turn, meaning they're getting ready for take off, but mao's full blade is on the ice at the end of 1/2, and she starts from there. this is just a personal opinion that i prefer midori's huge jumps. mao obviously knew how to jump 3A and i'm not saying it's wrong. she got the points, but im just saying it's not the textbook axel.",0.873,260
