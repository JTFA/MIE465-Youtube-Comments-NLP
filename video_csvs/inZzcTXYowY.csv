"Jacinta Ruivo 

– The song contains similar parts with some Harry's songs like _Two Ghosts_ or _From The Dinning Table_

– ""Tuesday nights"" and ""lights go on"" ( and not ""go off"") are references about stunts : ""Tuesday nights"" happened during the Lounielle era

– When Louis performed _Miss You_ during the Royalty Variety show, there were ""H"" lights spotted on the floor

– 0:56 This gesture means ""H"" in British sign language. Coincidence ?

– Green circles and pink triangles are gay references that mean ""Safe zone"" without homophobia.

– 3:15 a lot of people claimed the ""Style"" in the corner  with a blurred ""s"" at the end.

– Gender neutral pronouns in the lyrics. Louis was also gender neutral when he talked about _Miss You_ during an interview

Friendly reminder Louis said there wouldn't be any ambiguity in his songs 'cause he would be very honest in the lyrics. He also said his songs refer to the last 3 years

Please next time, don't be embarassing and be sure to be aware about all the elements before coming at people and calling them ""deluded""",0.9412,219
"Jacinta Ruivo Hey my point was to show you why people relate this song to Larry not to prove Larry presently. It's pretty obvious this song is about Harry (especially with the ""H"" lights) and with the sentence ""WE were in love now we're strangers"" it confirmed Larry was real at least during a time. And you can easily understand now why this song has no promo.

Btw you act like if a coming out was easy. Homophobia is still a thing nowadays and people are still killed or kicked out to their house for being gays.

Btw we talk about show-business : closeting is very used especially in the musical industry.

Anyway, I'm not here to convince you Larry is still a thing : if you wanna look by yourself do it it's not my problem. Just, don't be mad after people who think there's something to hide when medias still work hard to deny Larry (even after almost 8 years) and when the concerned can't appear or interact with each other anymore. 

And don't try to say it's larries'fault 'cause I can easily prove you the opposite",0.8704,208
"Jacinta Ruivo It's not pointeless it's just you don't wanna realise you're totally wrong. Not for the fact to not believe in Larry but to think we're the main guilty in this story. You keep saying the same and the same arguments I've already seen and debunked whereas I can argue with facts which clearly prove the opposite of what you said.

You seem to forget Larry is known even out of the 1D fandom. A lot of larries are even not 1D stan. I wasn't even in your fandom when I discovered Larry and when I became larrie a year ago. How can you explain people who are totally out of all the dramas can agree on a same thing ? More, most of larries used to be antis or Elounor shippers before and most of us are more than 17 so we're not crazy teenagers.

Anyway, despite what you think, larries'goal is Harry and Louis'freedom. That's all. We're just here to support their relationship bc nobody deserves to be forced to be in the closet. 

Larries also do a lot of projects for the boys since a lot of are 1D stans. But nah you reject them for  their belief. Louis and Harry love  all their fans so who are you to judge them ?

Nobody forces you to believe in Larry. But let those who believe in it alone and everyone will be fine 😊",-0.5584,254
"Jacinta Ruivo Lmaooo and what can I do 😂😂😂 ? Nothing. If you're not quite mature to realise larries are not all the same, I can do nothing for you. There're dumbasses everywhere, and since I pretty know the Larry World  I also know a lot of larries are problematic and give us a bad reputation with their double standard... And unfortunately, it's often the big Larry accounts 😩🔫 ! Don't worry if I blame antis to annoy larries on their Larry videos, I blame larries doing the same thing on Elounor videos or any ones relating to an another 1D ship. 

I'm also upset when I see larries commenting ""Larry"" on _Just Like You_ : okay, maybe there're some hidden references but the song is about Louis only 😒. But for _Miss You_ it's not annoying since this song is about it. But you'll see here more comments relating about 1D 😂😂😂.

Like you see, I'm quite honest with myself.",0.873,184
"Jacinta Ruivo Oh Lord you're not tired to always the same debunked arguments 😩🔫 ? 

First Larry proofs don't only consist in body language (if people still believe in Larry it's not for nothing) and _Miss You_ is about Harry no matter you agree or not. Louis said it would be very obvious and it is. When you see H lights during a _Miss You_ performance you can't easily claim the opposite.

Now with your ""you tear them apart"" sorry to disappoint but larries did nothing. The darkest larries ever are Louis and Harry themselves and I have a lot of examples to show you  they're not annoyed by larries at all.

Rumors can't ruin a friendship and even if it was the case, be sure the concerned would had denied it directly for years ago. But the fact is they didn't so it's useless to accuse us : try again 😂😂😂

And for the point ""there would be so little disadvantages"" it's not sure.

Larries are maybe numerous but they're not the majority. If it was the case we wouldn't receive so much hate. Btw don't forget Harry and Louis belong to one of the most famous boysbands in the world with a lot of straight girls fantazing about them. It's a big part of marketing and some of their fans are homophobic. A coming-out could ruin not only their career but other members' too.",0.7484,261

"Kooma Squishies It depends on what you build your advice. Tbh I think it's kinda stupid and useless to compare them. It's not a problem if you prefer Louis but why saying he's the best singer ? For example Louis can't do the same hight notes as Harry or Zayn and he doesn't have a voice as powerful as them. That proves he's not the best but that doesn't mean Louis'voice is useless : some 1D songs would sound very boring without him tho.

Just to say if 1D was formed with 5 boys at the beginning, it was not for nothing.",0.856,108
