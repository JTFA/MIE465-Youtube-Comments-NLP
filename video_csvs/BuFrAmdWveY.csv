"+Odile Mltt I do not consider me being forced to accept their subjective view of who they are a harmless situation. Especially since that view is in contrast to basic human knowledge, understanding and science. The LGBT movement has grown to have incredible influence despite their tiny numbers, spreading terror to people under the guise of political correctness. They are now talking about policeing language and forcing people to use pronouns. This will never be acceptable in my eyes. I have many gay friends who despise the LGBT. They are respectable people of our society. They do not parade showing their genitalia to little kids, they do not raise their own kids with the evil stance that neutral parenting is - basically neutral parenting consists of taking away all stuff associated with the kid's biological gender and intentionally exposing him to everything else. This is bound to scar some kids for life, confuse them, make them susceptible to bullying and so on so forth. I can go on and on about the evil that this ""gay"" movement is. It's not a movement for gay men and women. It is an ideological war against values with degeneracy. Anything except from gay men, gay women and transpeople who identify as 1 of the two genders is a mental illness. One can easily argue that these too are nature's weapons against overpopulation. But that is too extreme even though I can see it happening. And to be frank being trans is definitely a mental illness but it does not personally affect me at all, this is evident from the insane suicide rates *regardless of bullying or not being able to transition* . We used to call it gender dysphoria. Anyways, anything else is due to the mental illness of wanting to be special, of wanting a life with the privilege of not having privilege. That way anything wrong happens it's the system's fault, it's oppression. It's the product of weak-minded people who are exposed to the leftist/ideological propaganda in American universities.",-0.9803,374
"+Odile Mltt I'm from Greece. We value knowledge over a second language a lot. We could talk about this for ages since it's a highly debatable subject but I'd rather stop this here, it was nice talking to you.",0.3818,44
"+Odile Mltt Thanks for taking the time to read my view point, your english is fine by the way - I'm not a native speaker myself.
Regarding yout question I will answer this:  The key distinction is that the legislation the LGBT community is trying to pass *does not prevent you from doing something, it requires you to do something* . This is glaringly unacceptable. We live in a free society and people must have the right to speak their mind even at the cost of offending others.",0.1596,97
"+ishitbrokenglass  Enough about intersex people. I don't know why people like you keep mentioning them. The human species have 2 sexes and 2 genders for those sexes, like most species on Earth. Being intersex is a birth defect. It is also an extremely - and I mean extremely - low percentage of the population. There are less extreme cases of people being born with 6 fingers but when I ask you how many fingers a person has in each hand you will answer 5. You will not tell me that there is a spectrum of the number of fingers. Saying that gender identification is a spectrum is nothing more than gibberish for weak-minded people like yourself who want to feel special even if it means sacrificing the truth. I accept gays,bisexuals,trans people and respect women a lot. It seems that your pseudo-intellect doesn't do you any favors in an actual discussion. Ad hominem is your only tool and you don't seem to understand what *proof* and *scientifically backed* means. If someone feels that nature wronged him and he is a man trapped in a woman's body I will gladly accept him as a man. I will also gladly accept people who are attracted by their gender or both genders. But when you try to tell me that you are anything besides male or female then you are legitimately mentally unstable and need professional help.",0.9869,258
+ishitbrokenglass I'm sorry that I don't fit into your pseudo-humanitarian agenda that likes to normalize mental problems. I'm all for gay people having the right to be who they truly are but don't expect me to ignore basic human knowledge and understanding - the whole science of biology - because your fragile little self thinks that terms created by random people on tumblr have any meaning.,-0.1167,69

"Ioannis Duff What are you talking about exactly ? Uhm I don't know if I agree about always speaking your mind even if it offends others , I mean it depends on the situation but repeatedly offending someone  in the same of liberty doesn't seem very moral to me , especially if they are a part of an already oppressed community , even though freedom of speech and freedom in general are really important values. I mean respect is also important but I guess it depends on the situation and can be debated. ( btw your english is like really really good , I'm impressed lmao I thought you were a native speaker where are you from ? )",0.991,121
"Ioannis Duff honestly I don't see the problem you have with non binary people ? I don't think anyone can understand how someone feels about their gender except if they themselves experiment the same thing? Like I can't imagine not feeling female but that doesn't mean everyone feels either male or female , and I don't see why you would stop these people from calling themselves non-binary and using they/them pronouns. They are not harming anyone so why don't you just leave them alone ? Also you were saying it was a mental illness but do you have any proof to this ?",-0.2928,107
"Ioannis Duff just in case you didn't get the message. sexuality is a biiig spectrum with homosexuality and heterosexuality on both ends. aswell with gender- cisgender (male/female) are on both sides aswell and there are plenty of possibilities out and inside of this spectrum. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS UNIQUE (some obv. not since you seem to be a cis-straight-white-male and trust me there's plenty of you). and since intersex people exist who are born with both two xx chromosomes and an y chromosome who have BOTH sex characteristics congratulations you live in middle age where people believed that women with red hair are witches.
THERE IS BIOLOGICAL PROOF THAT NONBINARY PEOPLE EXIST aka there is biological proof that you're opinion is wrong. wake up and pay attention to the world. if you accept gays then accept bisexuals too, pansexuals too, trans ppl too, accept women, accept humans. or don't and stay trash.",0.9201,172
Ioannis Duff what the fuck is wrong with you- nonbinary people are valid people and deserve respect you sad little human.,-0.765,23
"Ioannis Duff you seem very informed about that topic and I recognise that you have a point. The LGBT community can be oppressive , pretty much like any community. I don't support everything they do of course , and I have to say that I'm not informed about everything that you talk about , I'll do some research. But still , when you were talking about people forcing pronouns on other people , don't you think you refusing to call by their desired pronouns people who identify as non binary is pretty much the same thing ? Anyway I can see your point of view but I don't fully agree with you and I guess there's nothing we can do to change each other's point of view. Btw I'm sorry about my English I am not a native speaker and I had a bit of trouble expressing my thoughts while typing this , sorry if it doesn't make sense.",-0.7406,164
Ioannis Duff you're so right dude. I think there are many sexualities because there are people who are attracted by trees or animals or nothing. But I think too that there are only 2 genders. If you feel like something beside male and female okay but your biological gender is Male or Female. I don't want to write a long text so I just wrote a short statement to support your opinion.
