"Damn good song, I've been waiting for a new album from Bastille for a couple minutes. I'm glad, it was worth the wait. I remember when Bastille exploded onto the scene in 2014 when it was a better, happier time for me, Bastille would be played in between each wrestling match in the state championships. It was my first time going to states and I was so nervous after winning my first three I had to wrestleback and wrestleback I did and got to finish 4th place senior wrestling season. Still missing that senior season, but I'm in college again and trying to get my first book series published, I'm also working on getting a couple other books started.",0.8106,130
