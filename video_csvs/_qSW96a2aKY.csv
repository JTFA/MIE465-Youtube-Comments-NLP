"1. When the sun Kuwwirat (wound round and lost its light and is overthrown).

5. And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together;
6. And when the seas shall become as blazing Fire or shall overflow;
7. And when the souls shall be joined with their bodies;
8. And when the female (infant) buried alive (as the pagan Arabs used to do) shall be questioned.
9. For what sin she was killed?
10. And when the written pages of deeds (good and bad) of every person shall be laid open;
11. And when the heaven shall be stripped off and taken away from its place;

A question absolutely no one asked, but Urban answered cause there's money to be had or some shit. I mean honestly. Look at the video image, the title.. listen to the lyrics, and look at Urban's pitiful avatar picture. Ugh.. everything about Urban is pathetic and repulsive to any male with a semblance of self respect.",-0.7577,112
