"I need to point out, that resolving the fear of monsters by befriending a child and then giving them a nightlight does not seem logical. I mean did he intend to scare him first and then befriend him to show that monsters are not something to be scared of. Which would be outrageous as well because that would be generalizing  all monsters into just one image. Even so what would the nightlight have to do with the whole occasion? I mean he proved his point by befriending the child why did he need to give him a gift? Furthermore, the kid did not even care about his monster friend leaving. What does that tell us? Consumerism makes friendship obsolete?

PS: Here are the Translations from German to English:
Boy: Friendship with a monster? Never ever dad! :(
Dad: Well, if you offer your friendship to the monster, it definitely won't say no to it. Just try.
