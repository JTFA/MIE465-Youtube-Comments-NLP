This isn't mine?""
And the teacher was like. ""Then why is it named your name?""
I noticed they were talking and saw the Tamagachi, and was like ""Er- that's mine...""
The look on their faces. RIP.
But then like, a few years later, I actually ended up going out with him. So that was interesting.",0.9214,146
