"Andrew Gibbons it's true though. Don't blame me, blame Disney for ruining an amazing character.

"As others here have stated in this thread, they were simply using a much beloved character for emotional contrivance - to get an emotional rise out of the Audience. That's cheating, and it's bad storytelling. I feel like they're using all these new ""revelations"" about the Force to justify Luke being a coward and hiding from the galaxy. That's all it is. Because in the end they DO justify it. ""It's OK, the Force is different that we thought. So you're off the hook."" No. I'm sorry but I don't accept that. 

Where did this fascination in modern fiction with emotionally broken, overly cowardly heroes come from? I don't want that in my escapism. Is it because we live in a society where Men don't stand up and face their responsibilities and fears? Where they abandon their families? And now it has wormed its way into Rian Johnson's writing. I understand that the hero should have doubts, and faults, and even scars (emotional or physical) but deep, DEEP emotional brokenness, to the point you've given up and turned your back on everyone and everything you have a responsibility to? In our galaxy, they call it PTSD and prescribe psychological treatment so you can heal. Seriously. That's where they've left Luke Skywalker. The Old EU (Legends) May have had its problems (Less than the New EU though) But at least Luke remained noble and courageous and people didn't just give up and walk out on everything. And yes, you may argue that it was under the guise of learning the true nature of the Force, but we didn't NEED to know that about the Force. It was never ABOUT the Force, its about the characters. The Force was just a vehicle for the storytelling. Even George realized that. It's about a family and their journey. Which, you've screwed up now. Another fascination in modern storytelling - seeing how bad you can screw up your characters - how badly you can emotionally damage them. That wasn't always a thing. But now Star Wars is on the same shelf as Game of Thrones. Well done, Disney. 

I think after watching The Last Jedi (Which, I've already read spoilers for and am highly disappointed but will watch anyways, more out of a sense of loyalty than any real remaining interest) I'm going to retreat to my own little corner of the Lore - The games and novels exploring The Old Republic - and stay there. As I've stated before, The story lines in the PC game ""The Old Republic"" and its predecessor games and books are much better written. And the characters are so much more responsible and noble and courageous - and they stand against evil instead of running from it. Episode 4 may have gotten me into Star Wars, but it was The Knights of The Old Republic, and its successors that really drew me in. It seems my stance of viewing these new movies as an alternate reality or mirror universe was completely and deeply justified. For me, old EU is still canon - The Heir to The Empire by Timothy Zahn is still what ACTUALLY happened, and these movies are just a ""What if?"" A very dark and melodramatic what if. TLJ just sounds like badly written fanfiction.",-0.8187,622

"This is from an article about an article. So it's kinda third hand. They were talking about Empire at the time.

""Harrison kept yelling through the whole thing, 'Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!'"" Lucas reportedly told Deadline. ""I said, 'Harrison, I can't kill you. I need you at the end of the next movie. There's this love thing going on. But I'll do the next best thing. I'll put you in a slab of concrete and ship you off to Mars.'""

So the concrete slab and the ticket to Mars became the carbonite freezing. And then he got thawed out in Jedi.

It's interesting though. *SPOILERS* I honestly thought Rick Deckard would get killed off in the new Bladerunner. Given how Ford shows patchy respect for his legacy characters at best.",0.8669,162
