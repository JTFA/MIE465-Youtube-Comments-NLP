"Ugh Yeri, Wendy and Irene really snapped here. Yeri needs more solo time with choreo as in give her parts that have you focusing on her like they do with seulrene. Irene is great on her feet, she is quick and is used to run around to get into formation which is she always in the center and edge. She can easily hit the steps very quickly and gracefully so clear as to why she is the lead dancer, she can hold her own in comparison to miss seulgi. Now wendy???? Wendy snapped severely. This is the kind of choreo they need to do more. Wendy is very in touch with her body like she can dance, she just struggles with some steps. She is very fluid as you can tell and good with moving her entire body. Quicker steps with hand movements and feet bother her more but she did amazingly here.",0.8236,169
