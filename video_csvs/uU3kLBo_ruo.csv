"Hi. I'm a nuclear engineer. I wanted to say a few things (relatively quickly) about the used fuel and radiation. I promise this is worth your 2 minutes or so.

First, there are several methods to recycle used fuel. Different types of reactors can directly use the spent fuel from water reactors as fuel, and what comes out of those is significant only for a couple of hundred years (compared to several tens of thousands for current water-reactor spent fuel or the indefinitely of chemical waste from other forms of generation). They can also be processed to recover other fissile isotopes (significant amounts of uranium fuel, as well as plutonium, neptunium, and other fuel elements created in the reactor) and create a mixed fuel that can be used in water-based or other reactors. These technologies have been demonstrated in projects that successfully recycled fuel for years.

Second, there are useful isotopes in that fuel valued at a few hundred million dollars that could be extracted and used in hospitals, industrial facilities, etc. Fear and misunderstanding of radiation, as well as economics with so few reactors in operation, are the major contributing factors against both isotope recover and any form of recycling.

Third, radiation ""escaping"" is a misnomer (4:20). Radiation is simply energy transferred from one place to another via particles. The particles can be light (photons), or chunks of atoms (electrons, neutrons, protons, and antimatter). Once these particles hit things, they lose energy and stop--and their danger stops because they no longer have energy to impart. Much like hot lava is dangerous, but after it cools it's pretty safe. When people talk about ""escaped radiation"", usually they are referring to the release of material that is radioactive, and while it's true that some of the fuel will be emitting radiation in hundreds of thousands of years, the amount of energy is so low that it would not be detrimental to human health to be around after a few thousands of years or even less (some thing after only a few hundred).

On that note, I also take reservation at the claim that ""thousands could have been killed"" (4:40) by radiation at Fukushima. Chernobyl released incredible amounts of radioactive material into the surrounding area, and as you noted (1:06), only 31 people died (most of whom flew over the core or died in physical-related accidents). The expected 4000 is from a group of 20,000-300,000, so your total possible effected rate for much later (at this point, its decades) in life is from 20% to 1.3% -- much lower than people expect for ""deadly radiation"". In fact, Canada has a facility where they irradiate mice, and they have found that the irradiated mice actually live significantly longer than non-irradiated mice. To be frank, we don't understand the interaction between radiation and biological systems, and so an ultra-conservative but incorrect model is used to predict those 4000 deaths.

I am horrified by the text of 7:45 -- it's such a messed up way to see this stuff. My main area of study is on the useful applications of radiation--and there are several hundred beneficial applications of just the radiation including imaging, medical treatments, use in industrial processes, material characterization, food preservation and breeding, sanitation, erosion studies, biological studies, electronics, and material development. Our unfounded fears over nuclear technologies turns one of the most beneficial discoveries in the history of mankind into what was described in that warning text. I'm frankly appalled that such a clear lack of understanding was formally adopted.

Fourth, the total volume of waste for nuclear, even with our unnecessarily wasteful practices, is still far, far less than any other energy generation type. It's actually a point of pride that even when handled as poorly as possible (which is what we're currently doing for mostly political and short-term economics reasons), it's still arguable better than anything else available. If you only focus on the negative aspects of something, it looks pretty bad. But when both positive and negative aspects of all energy generation methods (wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, natural gas, coal, etc etc) are evaluated for the same full-life-cycle timeframes, nuclear scores the best.

Now, all that said, nuclear waste is one of the few legitimate concerns that must be faced when talking about nuclear power. There are many solutions that the nuclear industry is not allowed to implement due to political or economics of scale reasons--not because of technical ones. And, like all power generation types, it has both good and bad aspects. We must be capable of raising above the temptation to accept the current way of doing things as the best or only way, and look at what is technically possible and feasible to figure out how we're going to generate our power--because not having electric power is not really an option if you want humans to have long, healthy, and prosperous lives.",0.9587,946

On the other hand, TMI did not collapse horribly. And thats most likely why it's not listed as level 7, and why you don't have the same ammount of radiation as Chernobyl.

"It really bothers me that people have this label ""nuclear waste"" in their heads that refers to something that is evil and dangerous and useless and must be disposed of for ever and ever.

What is the most profitable industry in the world today? Petroleum. What is the most profitable product it produces?  Gasoline.  The whole petroleum industry was engineered to produce more and cheaper gas, right?  Well, no.  In the early days, the primary product of the petroleum industry was kerosene.  Kerosene was used as fuel for kerosene lanterns, which in their day revolutionized home lighting.  Now, even in those days, processing petroleum to get the kerosene out of it produced some gasoline.  What did they do with it?  They threw it away.  It was a useless by-product, and very dangerous to have around.  Private ownership of gasoline was illegal for many years in some countries.

What changed that perception was new technology.  The internal combustion engine was invented, and it turned out gasoline worked great in internal combustion engines.  Within a few decades internal combustion engines were everywhere, and gasoline went from being an unavoidable by product that had to be disposed of to a highly desirable end product that was bringing in huge profits.  Once people found a use for the stuff the safety issues somehow became solvable.

""Nuclear waste"" is dangerous primarily because it is energetic.  If it didn't store large amounts of energy, it wouldn't be able to release the dangerous radiation that makes it hazardous.  But being highly energetic is precisely what you want in a fuel.  Gasoline was once considered useless and very dangerous.  We learned to use it.  It is my contention we can figure out how to get much of the energy out of ""nuclear waste"".  All it takes is research and development of new technology.  It is my belief that 100 years from now people will be amazed that we just threw this highly valuable resource away.",-0.5692,369

"So many errors in the video... first of all, name sources that put our uranium supply at 230 years. Second, storing waste isnt the problem.

It doesn‚Äôt help countries like the US because we would be much better off not risking a transatlantic voyage with a bunch of uranium. Also, you said there isn‚Äôt enough energy left in spent fuel rods to use. This is entirely untrue. There isn‚Äôt enough Uranium 235 left in the rods, the stuff we fission. The rest of the rod is Uranium 239, which does not easily fission, but still stores a ton of energy. The real solution here is to invest into making SAFE fast breeder reactors. Currently they aren‚Äôt used because they are expensive and dangerous, but with more research this could be changed, and in the end would be a much safer, more elegant, and cheaper option than a big hole in the ground. Breeder reactors fission Plutonium 239, and the extra nutrons can be used to bombard Uranium 239 (99% of naturally occuring uranium and the stuff that is currently a waste product) and by a series of decays, turn that into Plutonium 239 to fission.

"This is one of the most inaccurate depictions of nuclear waste I have ever seen. What the makers of this video completely ignored or didnt even care to learn about was the fact that most used fuel from a reactor is not waste at all. It is unused Uranium and Transuranic elements which can be reused in advanced reactors.

Nuclear waste at this very moment is not an technical, environmental, or human health issue.It is a vastly political and public acceptance issue.",-0.8235,88

"We're going about this the wrong way, we should focus on data permanence, basically focusing on communicating what this is instead of how to handle it.  By communicating knowledge we can help said future society in handling the issue themselves, instead of naively assuming they can't do any better than us.

Besides, this is itself an energy source, recycle that power in a low density system and we'll wear it out, if we can't get Thorium Salt Breeder Reactors working, we could at least make a second-rate PWR out of the rod-cooling rods and drive a heat-pump, or better use it as a heating system in colder climates.",-0.6384,119

One drop of water soluable mercury on your skin will kill u,  while u could live on top of a ton of radioactive waste for  weeks and have no ill effects.
