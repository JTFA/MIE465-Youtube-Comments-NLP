"Alright, this is only the 2nd video of yours that ive watched and I already feel a little better in myself. Im in that dark place but hearing someone so positive speak about anxiety in a way that sounds recognisable to me is so valuable. And hearing the same problems of being skinny and having to defend your natural body from people saying your ill and must fix it...that shit hits home and is something i havent really heard other people talk about before. So thanks.

I may not understand your memes yet (though, who doesnt want the sweet combined value of being a middle aged dad but also a 12 yr old boy) but I look forward to learning them as I join your people. You're pretty cool *aggressively thumbs up in an awkward fashion*",0.9535,149
