"Cool; it has some flaws (many have already pointed them out so I won't bother naming them). With that said, I don't know why everyone's so cynical. I mean, criticism is criticism but we shouldn't try to discourage someone, because who knows, these guys could very much have a ground-breaking idea in the future and we don't know. I love inventions and reverse engineering because it could very much change the way we live, so I hope people are considerate in their delivery of criticism so you're not destroying any opportunities for great ideas.

It may work better to have a bot that could flip with just tongs or something and perhaps having an optic sensor for heat instead of having to have something inserted in the steak? Really fun idea though, given an endless budget automating cooking would be really fun.
