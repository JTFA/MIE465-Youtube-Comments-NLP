I get it, both players are good, but I don't think the arguing and the fighting is necessary. I personally don't like Curry, but I don't think he's a bad player. Curry is an amazing player with talent that most players haven't or maybe can't even accomplish at all. Lebron James is the youngest player EVER to reach 30k points. Lebron James is a great player, no doubt about it, the same goes for Steph Curry.

Giannis is top 5 IMO but not over Steph. Stephs putting 27/7/5, to Giannis 29/8/4. Steph is just taking 17 shot attempts a night, and he only plays 32 MPG. He is also shooting 50/42/91 rn as well!! Harden should be #3 IMO because he's averaging 32/9/6 on 44% shooting. He's going to win the MVP award this year? AD ahead of the leading candidate for MVP!? Wow! You tweaking fr!! AD hasn't been consistent enough except for with the injuries bro. Russ should be #6 behind Giannis bruh. Cousin has been alot better than AD so far this season AD had back to back 40 games and now he's in the top 5? Smdh lol. No man. #1. KD #2. LBJ #3. Harden #4. Steph #5. Giannis #6. Westbrook #7.

"Mark my works, this player will become a legend and maybe better than jordan. He change the dynasty of NBA with his high IQ, selfless play, good off ball movement, shooting skill, dribbling skill, passing skill and team play. His defence is average but very efficient. His efficiency and shooting percentage is the highest, he doesn't waste opportunity and time. His clutch play destroy a lot of teams because he play for his teammate first than for himself, making him able to perform during critical situation. 

None of their team draft were top 5 picks, he allows his teammate to perform at the highest level, that's why KD join later and perform better in GSW than in OKC. Don't just look at score board, use your IQ and brain to see that their score, assist or rebound is slightly lower because they shared the glory, add together is much higher than before. First unanimous MVP, going to be the best shooter in the world and more championships are coming. You can hate on him but be grateful to live in this era with such a special player.

The organisation is smart enough to take the risk, knowing to build a superstar team is not to gather all the best players in the world, it is to build a team that can play around all the players, not just one player (Cough cough cav okc), making all the players able to perform without their stars. That's why curry is the one that can ignite all these, shipping monta ellis away. This is the new TREND of NBA, this will be the dynasty of teamwork.",0.9943,307

Compare to Klay,  Klay is a better 3 point shooter, way better defender and not as good ball handler, but he does not even get 1/10th the recognition that steph gets... 2015 championship largely because Lebron does not have killer instincts and missed his supporting cast....2016 final 4 games showed what Steph couldn't do when defense gets tough on him.... 2017 win is largely due to KD.
