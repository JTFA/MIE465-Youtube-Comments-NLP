"@Adam 

Jaylen wasn't a top draft prospect like Ingram.

Many ""experts"" suggested Philly should take Ingram NUMBER 1 over Simmons because he ""fit the modern NBA better"" with his shooting and length. 🙄  NOBODY was talking about Jaylen and most ppl laughed at Ainge when he surprisingly drafted Brown. From that perspective, Brown OVERACHIEVED with his 15ppg since nobody expected anything out of Brown.

Ingram was tagged ""untouchable"" and expected to avg ""20+ PPG"" and ""dominate"" and ""unleash his inner beast"" in his sophomore year.  None of this came into fruition.  

Come on brah, you're smarter than that...right? 😏",0.9317,123
"@NBA Players

Lol wow you suck at everything.  Wrong :)

– I'm not a failure
– I make way more than 0.000001% of Ingram's salary (which is $5.82 for you genius)
– I'm not fat (I have 9% body fat)
– I live in the most expensive city in the world

Everyone remembers how lost Deng looked out there in that first game, yet he was STILL more effective than Walking Dead Bust Boy Ingram. 🤷
