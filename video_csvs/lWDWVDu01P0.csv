"Big Pete old news, really 😂 African traits like blonde hair, red hair and blue eyes are older than 60k years. anyone can display African depigmentation genes, since humans are 100% African, 99.9% identical [Africans under the skin by nat geo], but African depigmentation genes didn't flourish in Europe until 5-8k years ago through young Asians (Neanderthal Africans) and ancient Hispanics (Denisovan Africans)...

""When it comes to skin color, the team found a patchwork of evolution in different places, and three separate genes that produce light skin, telling a complex story for how European’s skin evolved to be much lighter during the past 8000 years. The modern humans who came out of Africa to originally settle Europe about 40,000 years are presumed to have had dark skin, which is advantageous in sunny latitudes. And the new data confirm that about 8500 years ago, early hunter-gatherers in Spain, Luxembourg, and Hungary also had darker skin: They lacked versions of two genes—SLC24A5 and SLC45A2—that lead to depigmentation and, therefore, pale skin in Europeans today.""

"How dark he was may be debatable but to think they could be dark skin may not be far fetched. The Earth was way different 10000 to 30000 years ago and modern anatomical humans are maybe 160,000 to 250,000 years old. Long time to adapt.  I don't think the scientist would lie for the sake of doing so.  All humans came from Africa but dispersed in multiple waves. Some stayed, others left, some might have come back and then left again. Climate, climate change, diet, and breeding for characteristics played a role. Europe is really a combo of different groups. I don't have the hard science remembered but there were humans (Cro Mags I think) there during and before the Ice Age who descended from Africa, then other groups way later like Indo Europeans from the steppes and Early European Farmers from Turkey and the Middle East came and infused DNA. Bringing chieftain patriarchy, farming, and metallurgy. Not to mention other DNA strains from Hunnic invasions later on. Light skin needs Vitamin D and lighter skin helps in colder climates as it is opposite in too much sun for high melanin groups.  Caucasian females suffer high rates of osteoporosis compared to others. That's the brilliance of life. We are different but not. Different to survive in different regions but not too divergent where we're different species, so we maximize our survival and dominance over Earth. Europe was like good real estate. Cold weather kills tropical diseases. One theory goes that Homo Sapiens had immunity to African diseases which helped kill Neanderthals. Also, humans hunted better and the domestication of dogs may have played a role in killing our cousin species. Europe has access to water but is also not very big so the development of societies who could compete and work together based on Indo European ideas like chiefs aka kings helped to advance that group. But there's always been genetic exchanges such via the Roman Empire (think of it like a troop marrying a local woman), Hun invasion, trade, etc. A lot of racists don't want to believe that things are more connected than they seem but really humans have always explored, mated, and warred for resources. This whole defense of Western Civilization from a Eurocentric view is kind of flawed considering Western Civilization has absorbed other groups but also taken ""best practices"" from others. I know Europe is in a bad spot now with immigration and refugees but science is science and we can't let contemporary politics dissuade a united human species. It seems our leaders messed up but people are reverting to repeat history which caused misery. Things were good in the world until the USA destabilized the Middle East and has now jeopardized the post WWII alliance and economic prosperity. Now everyone is crazy like it's like Weimar Republic before the Nazis took over.",0.7941,527

It's like finding a ten thousand year old American skeleton and claiming he's the first ever native American.. lol. While I don' t dispute the fact Cheddarman  had dark skin the title claiming him to be the first Briton is ludicrous. Even Cheddarman wouldn't have even classed himself as a Briton. The Britons were the Celts.  Archaeologist themselves said at the beginning of this show  they have also found older skeletal remains which had signs of cannibalism on them. These bone fragments are much more older than Cheddar mans and predate him by four thousand years.They also said these bone fragments showed no relation to Cheddarman whatsoever. Oh and lets not forget the Red Lady of Paviland who is 33.000 years old. So why aren't these people being classed as the first Britons?  I'll tell you why.  It's because it doesn't  fit in with the political agenda of open borders. It's really sad to see this Mesolithic hunter gatherer being used for modern day politics.

Science is the most realisable source of fact we have, for all of you who are not geneticists and scientists that specialise in this field of research, then you cant really have a opinion about what is and what isn’t. Specially if you are a armchair researcher.
Science believes that everyone on earth originally decended from one place, biblicaly god did not make Adam and Eve from nothing, so that being said wether you are white, black or Asian our ethnic race did not just appear from now where, white people didn’t just magically appear on earth nor did black people nor did Asians, sceinficly we decended from one specific type of person, if you are religious then we all decended from Adam and Eve who where created from earth or dust I believe. So which ever way we look at it, wether biblically or scientifically we all came from the same place and the same people.
There will no matter what be people who will not exept biblical or scientific knowledge. And if you deny both, then you are creating your own theory’s bassed of your own accord. Which is how the problem began in the first place which is why we have dozens of religions and doezens of split scientific opinions.

"Theres quite a lot wrong with this whole story.
Firstly, they keep saying he was the first modern Briton. There is a reason why they are saying this..1. He wasnt the first. Older skeletons dating back thousands of years before him have been found and proven to be white. 2. Briton, as they keep calling it, didnt exist until the Romans invaded. When this man lived, Britain as we know it didnt exist either. It was still attached to Europe so therefore wasnt seperate or seen seperately like we do today. So he cant be the first Briton because it didnt exist.

Other problems with this story dont take into account that neanderthal man was found hundreds of thousands of years prior to this and had white skin.
Skeletons have been found and anaylised in Morroco some 350,000 years ago that had white skin that turned dark, due to higher sunlight exposure.
Cheddar man could well have had darker skin, thats obvious if he roamed from southern europe but that doesnt make him indigenous by any means. It doesnt take into account the whiter skinned people living in the area already.
This is just one skeleton they have found so why do the scientist jump to the conclusion he was the first Briton so quickly? Usually the scientist community argue for decades over the smallest points.

Britain, as we know it, was white. It was white when the Romans invaded and its been white ever since.
Also, they keep saying that 10% of the population have Cheddar Mans DNA. But what they fail to tell you is that over 30% of the population have Germanic DNA. And its well known that Germanic DNA is predominantly white.

No. This story has been dragged up post Brexit as one of the strangest lengths the Leftys and Liberals hae gone to, to make white people think twice about their roots.
But its totally innacurate. And just ask yourself this. Who cares? Who cares if this one skeleton had darker skin? Hes not alive today. He has no influence whatsoever on modern life anymore than Woolly Mamouths once roaming the British Isles. Who cares? Its so far removed from our lives in the moment it has zero relevance.

So lets stop pretending he was the first Briton because he wasnt. Britain didnt even exist back then and this guy certainly wasnt the first by any means.

Its a very dangerous world we live in when science tries to force politics on people.",-0.7011,466

"This 3.6-Million-Year-Old Fossil Is The Oldest, Most Complete Human Ancestor Ever Seen
Say hello to ""Little Foot"".

MICHELLE STARR 7 DEC 2017
After 20 years of slow, careful excavation, the world's most complete skeleton of an ancient human ancestor has just been unveiled.

It belongs to the genus Australopithecus, and it's 3.67 million years old. It is, by far, the most complete hominin skeleton globally older than 1.5 million years, and the oldest hominin skeleton ever found in South Africa. Its name is ""Little Foot"" - because the discovery of the skeleton started with four small footbones.

""This is one of the most remarkable fossil discoveries made in the history of human origins research and it is a privilege to unveil a finding of this importance today,"" said Ron Clarke from the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who discovered the skeleton 20 years ago.

Little Foot is not the oldest hominin skeleton ever found - that honour goes to Ardi, a hominin that lived in Ethiopia 4.4 million years ago. But Little Foot is significantly more complete than Ardi, and may be more informative.

It's expected that Little Foot will be able to provide a wealth of information about our early Australopithecus ancestors - how they moved, how their skeletons are put together, what they looked like.

Isotope analysis of the fossilised tooth enamel may even help fill in some gaps about the environment Little Foot lived in, and the food she ate.",0.9681,280

For those who don't have a subscription,here's the text-

""A Briton who lived 10,000 years ago had dark brown skin and blue eyes. At least, that’s what dozens of news stories published this month – including our own – stated as fact. But one of the geneticists who performed the research says the conclusion is less certain, and according to others we are not even close to knowing the skin colour of any ancient human.

The skeleton of Cheddar Man was discovered in 1903 in a cave in south-east England where it had lain for 10,000 years.

Until a few weeks ago, he had always been depicted with pale skin. This makes some sense, given that people living at northern latitudes often have paler skins. The explanation may be that it allows more of the weak northerly sunlight into their skin, so they can make enough vitamin D. And it seems our species reached Europe 30,000 years before Cheddar Man lived, so his ancestors would have had plenty of time to evolve paler skins.

But the new DNA analysis suggests that Cheddar Man may have had dark skin. Most news stories said his skin was “dark to black”.

Giveaway genes

To show this, researchers including Susan Walsh at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis read Cheddar Man’s DNA. Walsh had helped develop a model that attempts to predict someone’s eye, hair and skin pigmentation solely from their DNA, and the team applied this model to Cheddar Man.

The most recent version of the model was published in May 2017. It focuses on 36 spots in 16 genes, all linked to skin colour.

To test it, Walsh and her colleagues took genetic data from over 1400 people, mainly from Europe and the US but also some from Africa and Papua New Guinea. The team used part of the data to “train” their model on how skin colour and the 36 DNA markers are linked. They then used the rest of the data to test how well the model could predict skin colour from DNA alone. The model correctly identified who had “light” skin or “dark-black” skin, with a small margin of error.

When Walsh and her colleagues applied the model to Cheddar Man, they concluded his skin colour fell between “dark” and “dark to black”.

Not so sure

The research was first announced by press release, to coincide with the release of a TV documentary. It has now been posted to a preprint server.

Walsh stresses that the study doesn’t conclusively demonstrate Cheddar Man had dark to black skin. We cannot place such confidence in the DNA analysis, she says. For one thing, Cheddar Man’s DNA has degraded over the last 10,000 years.

“It’s not a simple statement of ‘this person was dark-skinned’,” says Walsh. “It is his most probable profile, based on current research.”

In fact, we are not ready to predict the skin colour of prehistoric people just from their genes, says Brenna Henn at Stony Brook University, New York. That’s because the genetics of skin pigmentation turn out to be more complex than thought.

Too many genes

In November 2017, Henn and her colleagues published a paper exploring the genetics of skin pigmentation in populations indigenous to southern Africa – where skin colour varies more than many people appreciate. Just weeks before, a group led by Sarah Tishkoff at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia had published a paper on the genetics of skin pigmentation in people from eastern and southern Africa.

“The conclusions were really the same,” says Henn. “Known skin pigmentation genes, discovered primarily in East Asian and European populations, don’t explain the variation in skin pigmentation in African populations. The idea that there are really only about 15 genes underlying skin pigmentation isn’t correct.”

It now seems likely that many other genes affect skin colour. We don’t know how.

If we are still learning about the link between genes and skin pigmentation in living populations, we can’t yet predict the skin colour of prehistoric people, says Henn.

This debate may seem of little practical importance – although the idea that Cheddar Man was dark-skinned generated enormous public interest. However, we need to know the limitations of this sort of genetic technology.

Police could one day plug DNA from a crime scene into one of these models to determine what a suspect looks like. Walsh’s model might succeed at this in the US, says Henn, because it was trained on DNA from people with similar ancestry to North Americans. But it may well fail elsewhere.

Henn’s team has tested an older model that aimed to predict skin colour from DNA. When they put it to work among southern African populations, “it literally predicted that people with the darkest skins would have the lightest skin”
