"The thing that's difficult about explaining what a period really feels like to a guy, is that it's a different experience for everyone. My best friend can get her period and go to the gym the same day, and she doesn't use birthcontrol or painkillers. My first day of my period consists of screeming and crying in bed for hours untill the painkillers kick in, after that I can carefully sit up and maybe watch a little tv or read a book. I try planning my period so that the first day is always on a sunday. So sometimes it's hard for women to understand each other, so how can men completely understand it? What also doesn't help is that periods are still labeled as something to be embarassed about. A guy asked me why I took my bag to the bathroom with me, I told him I was on my period, he responded: 'Oh wow, I didn't needed that image in my mind, can't you just tell us it's a girl thing so we can pretend you are doing your make-up?'
