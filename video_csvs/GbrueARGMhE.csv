He should become a YouTuber,0.0,5
He should consider stand up. He has good timing. Funny.,0.7003,13
He should've won gold in the individual event. He didn't even stumble. He was far superior to Hanyu and Javi. They both stumbled a bit. How could three skaters who fell or stumbled make the podium while Adam who was perfect placed 10th. It's so unjust. He was held back by the bigoted homophobic judges who clearly favoured the straight boys. Quads are overrated. We should give more points to artistry than to acrobatics. Figure skating is art. Artistic skaters like Adam should be given more credit and more points. He created magic on the ice whereas Top 3 were just jumping a lot showing off their superior motor skills.,0.9751,122

"I think that's representative of most gay men's sentiment about Adam XD. 
But hey he is a great skater and very clever, too. He basically gave up on going against the Japanese kid who ended up becoming a two-time Olympic champ and concentrated on giving clean performances. Nothing spectacular but he didn't bomb. Nathan, on the other hand, seriously pitted himself against the Japanese kid and bombed big time. I appreciated Nathan's balls and I believe he's gonna be a world champion in the near future but that was painful to watch. Adam knew his limitations and used that self-knowledge rather well.",0.9785,112

I would love to introduce him BTS!!! If he yet doesn’t know who they are 🤣,0.7249,21
"I wouldn't say he's being defined by it. He's merely out of the closet and isn't afraid to be unabashed about the fact that he's effeminate and that his desires and passions lie with guys. So many famous gay and gay-leaning people, even ones out of the closet, show a ton of discomfort and shame or make being gay/gay-leaning something sad or become obsessed with not being ""defined"" by their orientation. While homphobia, internalized homophobia and self-loathing are still very much real issues. They're especially issues in the sports world (though perhaps not figure skating). His complete opposite approach is somewhat refreshing. However, yes, more than a bit camp, more than a bit of a showman, and he's using it all as part of his marketing and persona. But that often comes with the territory with public figures.",-0.6204,159
