"""Take A Chance On Me""

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try

Take a chance on me
(That's all I ask of you honey)
Take a chance on me

We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better
'Cos you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try

Take a chance on me
(Come on, give me a break will you?)
Take a chance on me
Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
It's magic
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind
No I can't let go
'Cos I love you so

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa ba-ba

I’ll try to to work as hard as I can...",0.9595,113

"this video really gives me the confidence to go forward with my career path, which is a beauty makeup artist/ spfx makeup artist.  I've been watching you for a long time and when i found your channel i was like ""ah! shes doing exactly what i want to do!"" so i have related to you very much.   i have had the same career goal for about 7 years now, but i'm just a freshman in college.  and not even in a makeup school yet.  i have had a few opportunities to showcase my skills and some paid, but nothing BIG...yet. which ins't too surprising considering i live in Idaho, and not only are there NO makeup stores in the part i live, but also no opportunities for the career i'm going for.    i'm really hoping i can make my break in the makeup industry.  i know its hard to start this kind of thing, but I've wanted this for a long time now, so hopefully something good will come my way.  I've always loved your channel and it really inspires me to keep on keeping on! so thank you for being you and giving me the confidence to do what i love.  <3 love you!!",0.9961,231

"when you mentioned how it was sad that some places rely on follower count or popularity to get a certain job or such. this reminds me of how it happened to me. NYIB 
(new york institute of beauty) had a contest for high school students to get a chance to work on models for fashion week. we could enter for hair and/or makeup. i did both. i sadly didnt win because i had a small following. whoever got the most amount of likes got to go to fashion week. most of the girls who entered bought their likes, i didnt. there were 3 winner for makeup and 2 for hair.",0.073,124
