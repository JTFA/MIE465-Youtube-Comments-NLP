I worked as maintenance electrician and this would be great to be able to walk up to a piece of failed equipment and immediately have a electrical drawing and information through the glasses instead of carrying something like a phone or tablet to short cut repairs. A non intrusive solution to a point. Could be used in many applications in many fields. Nurses could automatically be tied to equipment for emergency monitoring. Law enforcement could have data on suspected criminals flashed on eyeglasses without any body seeing its there.  Naval workers on aircraft carriers could have information flashed on eyeglasses on incoming jets, helicopters. People  in cars on freeways could be warned of cars braking or slowing ahead. In the home a recipe could be on the glasses for cooking hands free. The list goes on and on and on.  BUT the cons on these glasses is that it is another distraction, I can see many people getting hurt or worse because they are distracted by the information they get and not paying attention to their surroundings.",-0.9437,196

"Now this looks neat. I never could get on board with smartwatches- their use seemed way too niche. View notifications in a kind of discrete way and maybe play music offline or something. Smartglasses in comparison sound like they could be 7 degrees more useful if they could connect to a phone with Bluetooth to get GPS data and do things like show restaurant reviews or update breaking news or something. Imagine- if a camera could get put in these, maybe it could be used to identify wanted suspects when you're walking down the street. The AI recognizes their face and tells you to check your phone, which will then pull up a photo of them. Then you can choose to anonymously report it if you think that the two faces are actually a match and not a fluke of the camera. This is obviously 90 leagues of privacy violation, but hey we're going there anyway, might as well do something neat while we're at it.",0.8719,180
