"All my mom would do is put on some shimmery pink-ish eyeshadow on her lid and a brown shade in her crease, at least I think she does. She puts some translucent powder all over her face and some mascara. She has like a million cover girl pallets that have 4 colors in them and uses only two. She has 2 red lipsticks that she used once for a party she went to. Love you mom",0.8555,81

"when I was little, I got a bright blue eyeshadow, a mascara and an eyeliner from my dad. He wanted me to start practicing since I found it so exiting! But I was not alowed to use it outside, and off course since I was young I didn't listen to him. So I would pack on three layers of mascara and so much eyeliner to my waterline. And I would walk to school like that, everyone was complementing me for looking beautiful. Since I always got home before him, I would hurry up and wash it away. I still believe he new though. And I would walk to school like that everyday. first time i applied it, and went out to show him. he would just stay silent and look at me as if he just saw a clown or something hehe.
