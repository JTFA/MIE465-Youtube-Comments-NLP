üòï this movie right here I just cannot get into at all like seriously. I want to see it and I try to give it a chance but for some reason I wasn't really into this movie.

I mean like I said before it's unusual for me not to like a Disney movie. Disney doesn't know what they're doing and can tell this is a popular movie A lot of people love it. It's just one of those movies not for me. Anyway the one big movie. I'm waiting for November 2nd to get here. The reason for this I'm waiting for Disney's The Nutcracker and the four realms. I know I'm going to love that movie I actually love the trailer for it. The Nutcracker and the four realms look totally fantastically awesome. Can't wait but I can wait got to have patience it'll be here before we know it.,0.9896,207
