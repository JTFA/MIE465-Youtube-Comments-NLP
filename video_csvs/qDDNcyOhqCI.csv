With Transformers I don‚Äôt think reboot is the answer. It just needs a change in direction and I think Travis Knight is great first step. Look at fast and furious.

"the view report.

Coogler for that bothan spy thriller thing that i don¬¥t know why they¬¥re not talking about making?

rather see a chappie 2 than a transformers remake.

he-man! space prince :).

transformers in space! how about real robot cars? no cgi :). would be sweet with a non cgi turtles movie :).

dracula untold and the mummy can both be counted to the dark universe i think, they¬¥re about the same...

steven spielberg for g.i. ryan ;).

the plane crash scene in the mummy was nice.

was king kong a bit big? godzilla worked. cranston could¬¥ve been in it more perhaps?

i feel similarly about dc, although they¬¥re leagues better than transformers...

could¬¥ve been sweet if these new cgi disney remakes were sequels instead.
The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) is the lion king sequel ;).

looking forward to halloween, like that carpenter¬¥s involved. don¬¥t understand why they¬¥d skip the 2nd movie though...

be sweet with a blomkamp alien 2.5, keep Newt a kid-teens to fit between 2 and 3. 3 could do with some cgi retouching to the alien.

what if james bond¬¥s in the mcu ;). maby gambit makes an appearance playing cards...
