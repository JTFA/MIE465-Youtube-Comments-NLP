"And I need your love, I need you here with me
And I don't care 'bout much else
And I know it's hard for five million reasons
But I don't think I could wait

When I'm feeling your love it's like a wind that blows
I can't give up and I can't let go
I won't give up, I won't lose

When I'm broken down and I'm bruised
I'm gonna get myself back home to you, ooh

Only you-ah
Only you-ah
Only you-ah
Only you


And I need someone to lay down beside me
'Cause I can't sleep by myself
And my poor old heart's in five million pieces
Now I'm asking for your help

When I'm feeling your love it's like a wind that blows
I can't give up and I can't let go
I won't give up, I won't lose
When I'm broken down and I'm bruised
I'm gonna get myself back home to you, ooh
