Aaaaarghh!! It must just be me but the “next to me” line just falls so flat!! Why didn’t they elongate it like the rest of the song? All of the buildup in each line led to a cut off lyric. Oh well; I think 30 million people would disagree.,-0.3222,61

NEXT TO ME TESTO IMAGINE DRAGONS

Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin’ at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me

Stress lines and cigarettes, politics and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin’ and hollerin’
But still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You’re shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I’m far from good, it’s true
But still I find you
Next to me (next to me)

There’s something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin’ effortless
And still you, still you want me

I got no innocence, faith ain’t no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You’re shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I’m far from good, it’s true
But still I find you
Next to me (next to me)

So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn’t easy
But I hope to be worth it (oh)
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn’t easy
But I hope to be worth it (oh)

Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down)
You’re shattered on the ground, (shattered on the ground)
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do (stupid things I do)
I’m far from good, it’s true
But still I find you
Next to me (next to me)

NEXT TO ME TRADUZIONE IMAGINE DRAGONS

C’è qualcosa nel modo in cui sei entrata nel mio salotto
Casualmente e sicura di te, guardo il disastro che sono
E tu ancora, mi vuoi ancora

Linee di tensione e sigarette, politica e deficit
Conti da pagare in ritardo e eccessi, gridando e strillando
E tu ancora, mi vuoi ancora

Oh, ti deludo sempre
Lo gridi per terra
Ti trovo ancora lì
Vicino a me
E oh, le cretinate che faccio
Sono tutt’altro che buone, è vero
Ti trovo ancora
Accanto a me (accanto a me)

C’è qualcosa nel modo in cui vedi sempre le cose belle
Trascuri il disordine sanguinante, sempre in maniera spontanea
E tu ancora, mi vuoi ancora

Non ho l’innocenza, la fede non è un privilegio
Sono un mazzo di carte, un vizio o una partita a carte
E tu ancora, mi vuoi ancora

Oh, ti deludo sempre
Lo gridi per terra
Ti trovo ancora lì
Vicino a me
E oh, le cretinate che faccio
Sono tutt’altro che buone, è vero
Ti trovo ancora
Accanto a me (accanto a me)

Quindi grazie per avermi dato una possibilità
So che non è facile
Ma spero di valerne la pena (oh)
Quindi grazie per avermi dato una possibilità
So che non è facile
Ma spero di valerne la pena (oh)

Oh, ti deludo sempre (ti deludo sempre)
Lo gridi per terra, (gridi per terra)
Ti trovo ancora lì

E oh, le cretinate che faccio (le cretinate che faccio)
Sono tutt’altro che buone, è vero
Ti trovo ancora
Accanto a me (accanto a me)
