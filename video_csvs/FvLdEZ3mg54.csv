"Cause trending has the videos that made the staff poop a tiny bit out of their bootyhole and needed to wipe on the button they used to clean to poopy stuff out before fucking publish it with their molded fetus brain remains. They look back to their dead fucking fathers for guidance to which they're given a bright smile of approval. They then contemplate the woman from the cafeteria who, albeit, old, has a fat ass. They're then suddenly aware that no matter what the fuck they say, people will always take it as a compliment. They'll ask, ""can I eat those latino cheeks?"" and they'll get the same response, like everyone else. So they get directed back to their offices to look for shit that makes at least 3 of their neurons go ""HOLY SHIT that made me poop a little out of my butthole!"". They spend the rest of the day looking for their chromosomes before going to bed, knowing their only solace from this brief yet painful experience is using both palms to wank the shit out of their diddly widdlys about her, the exotic, the ever-fleeting, cafeteria lady. Oh, if only she knew.",-0.9235,222
