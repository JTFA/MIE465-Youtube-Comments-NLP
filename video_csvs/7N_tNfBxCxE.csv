"I wouldt recommend it, if you do have a good 45 or above fps, its not worth it how it makes your controls very clunky. so if you play games like pubg, its not good, Fps is good, but everything you do in there is like 2/3 of a second late. it also doesnt give you Full HD graphics that you see on videos, very sightly blurry, sometimes it increases in blurriness out of no where. From how Pubg is already such a Clunky game, and i say it again, not worth it if you already have a 45 or above fps.
