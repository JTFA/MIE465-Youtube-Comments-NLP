"At the Olympic games you rarely see an athlete so much better than everyone else they can literally coast and still win by a huge margin(see Usain Bolt 2008 100M)

That was Chloe Kim in the Halfpipe. Her first run was a 94**. The top score from any of the other 11 girls in three runs each was an 89. So, just to show off, in her last run Chloe threw down a 98.25

**anyone who has watched Chloe over her career knows she was in third gear on that first run.",0.8773,105

"For a lot of reasons. For starters, I'm a convicted felon for committing mail fraud so I can't compete in things like Olympic games. Second, I'm from a country which is not competitive in the winter games. And third, interest in snowboarding is not very high. Which is why countries send amateurs instead of professionals.",0.1235,63

If the father had never wanted learned how to snowboard then the accident of finding how good his daughter can truly be on a snowboard would never have happened.  Due to how late in his age he wanted to snowboard and having a dad n daughter time turned her into the best in the world.  She should thank her dad for chasing his dream of learning how to snowboard which lead to her to becoming a gold medal Olympic.  Great story.,0.9559,85
