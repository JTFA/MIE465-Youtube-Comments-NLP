"""He cracked the code!""
LOL! But seriously, BL has consistently been fleshing out it's characters, and tries to avoid single dimensional stereotypes. The villains are ruthless, but you see why. Women are treated (by the villains) as chattle, to be used as money making objects, with no say in their fates. And the music is excellent. Great show, so far.",0.8914,77

But the effects are horrible. I can't say if they are cheap or just look wrong. I think they could have achieved more with less. I was so pumped up for his first appearance as Black Lightning, but then Ijust laughed. He looked like a neon sign from the 80's. They could have just used some more conservative reflecting material on his chest for the lightning detail, not an actual neon tubes. He looks like a clown.

I was thinking about this show. The CW only ordered 13 episodes and from what i am reading it seems to be doing very well. Better than they hoped. If there were any dc shows that would work with the movie verse it would be Black Lightning. He kinds of reminds me of Iron man with Marvel.

All in all I think the show can be pretty fun but as of the first episode I'm not as into it as you. One thing that I absolutely love is that Jefferson Pierce is a veteran super hero, one that gave up on the gig when it looked like it didn't matter but still became a school principal to have a positive influence on kids in his community. I also think I remember seeing Tobias in the DCAU where he was a small yet interesting villain that wanted to flee everything with his kid, which makes me think that having the show be all about family could really tie the story together.",0.9866,156

"I really liked the beginning of black lightning. but then the show turned to shit. Just hear me out.  
First, the costume...is very bad. it doesn't feel authentic. You can SEE how hard it is to move in those action scenes.  It feels like a Halloween costume tbh.Its like those old 1995 batman movies where actor have to turn their entire body because the mask is connected to the neck piece. Second,  The music...is just horrible. A good music in the background is what makes a good action scene grab attention. repeating the name of the song over and over doesnt make it sound cool..its just cringy. The music is just stupid, they should change the suit and the theme song and the overall track. The fighting is also not as great. Once again, u can NOTICE the suit because you can see that its limiting movement. In a great superhero show, u don't notice the suit, u notice the hero. you get what im saying? For Spiderman, u dont see a man in a spider costume, u see the superhero. here u just see a man wearing a ridiculous costume. This is an becoming an issue with Superman and arrow. the actors, action, and suits dont feel authentic. Flash is probably one of the only CW shows to pull off everything right because they work more on the story than the costumes (my dumb option anyways). The choreography is also pretty horrible. Honestly, the show has potential. but they need better costumes, better music, better choreography.",-0.7667,301

There's a scene were the brother from TVOne is doing a commentary where he asked why others are considered heroes but Black Lighting is seen as a vigilanty.

"You really should try out the other CW DCTV shows, if you don't watch them now. Black Lightning is a little more socially conscious than the other ones, and I get why you would start with that one--but they are all really, really good. I like Supergirl and The Flash more than the other two but they are all good.",0.8387,66
