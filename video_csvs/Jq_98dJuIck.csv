I know the movie is sc-fi/ fantasy, but why take liberty with common sense and rationale?¬†There are other minor inconsistencies that could have been corrected with very minor changes in the script. One character floating around in space unharmed. Two characters sneaking off to a surreal Vegas like planet to find the code master or was it the key master? (Matrix plot) Benicio del Toro for no reason knowing the rebel plans. Smaller resistant ships escaping the larger resistance main ship suddenly are magically within firing range.

Your reality distortion field will shut down and you will be left (like the rest of us) empty of any emotional investment for this cinematic pulp.¬†

There is nothing that makes this movie even mildly enjoyable, I forced myself to stay for the full movie when I wanted to go and get my money back, but that's not likely to happen in our current society. It's a complete waste of time, a absolute waste of energy. There is nothing that even remotely makes this a movie much less a movie to carry on the Star Wars legacy. Any practical use of a character was defecated on by the script and director. Absurdly cliche, horribly dragged out by a lack of a story. All dialogue was nothing more then quick line liners of terrible attempt at humor. I should have waited til last jedi was in the dollar bin at a goodwill.

- [ ] Make it the same as the original trilogy, but also make it different. Don‚Äôt change anything. Make sure to include some surprises, but not surprised we don‚Äôt want, in fact AVOID SURPRISES. But don‚Äôt rehash anything, also don‚Äôt try something new cause we won‚Äôt like that. Make sure we do justice to the cast, but we don‚Äôt say how. Make sure we get it right, I want it to be exactly the way I want it, just a bit different, also the same. Make sure we know the backstory to all the characters, even the incidental ones cause we all speculating , and you better be reading my mind, but leave it mysterious at the same time . No cgi , keep it practical , make sure to expand the universe like the prequels did ... you know using ... cgi. Also don‚Äôt do anything the prequels did or force awakens or the original trilogy, but make it like those films too. Give it some humour, but don‚Äôt make it too funny. Show us some new force powers, but not ones we haven‚Äôt seen before cause new powers are ridiculous. DON‚ÄôT KILL ANYONE, it betrays my childhood , but make it unpredictable by killing off a few characters.

"Why are people liking this video? It says SPOILER FREE in the title yet it gives every event in chronological order, WTF is wrong with you people whoever wrote that title should be fired.",-0.6705,37
Wonderful story filled with complex and vulnerable human emotions and relationships. Much more relatable as it is being told in the most realistic way possible for a film of this nature. I think Rian did a great job.,0.7845,41
Would've been 9.7 if they didn't butcher and weaken Luke,0.3252,10

"You could cut 1 hour out of this 'film' and have a better final result. The blue milk scene is so f*cking stupid it makes me want to cry, the Rose & Fin 'relationship' is complete nonsense especially the side mission to find the 'code breaker', who is a complete waste of story line. This steaming pile of shite makes The Phantom Menace look like a masterpiece.",-0.7769,80

"‚ÄúFunny film?‚Äù What? No it wasn‚Äôt. Force Awakens had a good balance of humour but Last Jedi had too many jokes (unfunny cringeworthy ones). Too much that you can‚Äôt take serious moments of the movie seriously. Last Jedi is a joke. Good job Rian, good luck JJ abrams.",0.9677,64
‚ÄúRians biggest success is that the bloated subplot doesn‚Äôt completely ruin the movie‚Äù. Uhhh ok.,0.204,21
