Fake but nice work keep it up,0.3919,7
"Fan-fucking-tasic! At least this fan trailer establishes a better tone and features shots that look distinctive than whatever generic action movie starring Tom Hardy that Sony was marketing in the film's first trailer. Great job, bud!",0.9171,40
"For a fun little trailer edit this was pretty decent Bill, obviously better than whatever that official teaser is, so well done <3",0.9179,25
Great man!,0.6588,3
Great moving watch for real,0.6249,5
Holly crap! Great work.,0.4199,6
Horror Knight I saw it on CBM!,-0.6114,8
I wish the actual trailer took this much time and care.,0.7096,12
"If this was the actual trailer, everyone would have complained that it showed too much. With the trailer we got, everyone said it showed too little. Few teasers ever get the balance just right, like Hulk 2003 which has the perfect teaser trailer in my opinion.",0.2682,52
Jeff Mitchell its from the daredevil netflix show,0.128,8
"Just like regular folks making way better Cosplay costumes, average Schmoes making better trailers than the so-called Hollywood ""professionals"". Hollywood needs an overhaul in their ""talent"" pool.",0.8074,34

"Let's hope the movie has plenty of venom scenes, can't wait either way. Nice vid",0.6908,17
Looks a cool movie,0.3182,4
"Love the Life tie in...the prequel theory exists in my headcanon. Also, Sony should hire you to do the trailers and tv spots",0.6369,27
Marvel should definetely hire you before dc comics does! I’d love to see more from u because this was really good!,0.8951,25
"Nice job! This was nicely done. Hoping the next trailer is more like this.
Shouldn't click-bait though, seriously. Add ""Fan Made"" in the title and don't put ""full trailer"" or you're bound to get loads of ""fake"" comments.",0.9246,50
Now I realize this is a fan-made trailer with clips from other movies but this was a million times better than the piece of shit trailer we actually got OMG if this was the movie it would be epic love the Spider-Man Clips being tossed in,0.6956,46
Now THIS is this horror element that the teaser should have had! Well done especially for being fan made,-0.4594,20
Now this is a Venom trailer! Great job!,0.6892,10
"Perfect, just perfect.... Venom is such a great character,  I can only hope they do the symbiote and Eddie justice in the actual movie.",0.9337,28
"Pretty sure it's been confirmed that whatshisname is going to show up, at least as a cameo. He may show up as a different character, but I think the actor is supposed to show up as a wink and a nod, which makes sense because Sony is going to need some help after dropping the ball on the original trailer.",0.85,65
Rami Al-Omari it is,0.0,4
Really cool work here! Very well done! Just thought the last scene kills a bit of the venom themed feeling you created with the clip up to that point.,0.5529,32

"This is fantastic. It made the movie almost interesting.  I was going to call your editing professional grade, but seeing how the ""professionals"" cut trailers now a days. It would be an insult to your talent.",-0.1018,43
This is the trailer we needed,0.0,6
"This is what the teaser trailer should've been. A perfect balance of the horror, sci-fi, suspense thriller and superhero genres, while also mantaining proper connectivity to the MCU Spider-Man Universe. A bit of inspiration from John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, along with some flavor of the works of Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon. Just the way I like it.",0.6486,67
This looks better than the actual trailer,0.4404,7
This looks way better than the actual Teaser Trailer.,0.2263,10

"Very cool.
I'm hoping the first act of Venom will have the Infinity/Spidey nods we're hoping for, but I'm loving this horror vibe.",0.485,28
Well i'll admit...this was pretty good...but still why does everyone think Spider-Man is gonna show up in the venom movie..also everyone still upset that venom didn't show up?..get over it already.,0.4019,41
What we should have gotten . I appreciate this man.👌🏾,0.4019,13

"You much talent, sir (or ma'am). Keep up the amazing work. Hopefully, this goes viral and equates to a job at Marvel Studios.
Or a job at WB/DC Studios cuz let's face it.....they need the help more so than Marvel nowadays lol",0.9607,53

"no it's not. It's one of those ""trailers"" that show whole movie in 2 minutes, I'm sick of trailers and teasers and what not that show you all good bits. The offi ""Venom"" trailer was a trailer that gave you smting but not everything, it gives you hype for looking forward  to see movie.",-0.2846,63
