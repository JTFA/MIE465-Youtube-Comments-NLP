"""There's no Filipino version here....""

Because when Pokémon first aired in the Philippines, the English dub was chosen to be shown on TV, (so there's no song adaptation done for Filipino even it was locally dubbed at a later time). 

Since we watched it on English, that makes Filipino kids back then believed it's a US cartoon while it's actually a Japanese anime ( and some of them who already grew up can't still believe that  Pokémon is an anime), so all of us Filipinos, though known to be highly exposed to anime, we're more familiar with the characters and Pokémon species by their English names instead of their Japanese names, so we know more about Ash, Misty, and Brock than Satoshi, Kasumi, and Takeshi, then also the same goes that we know more of Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur than Hitokage, Zenigame, and Fushigidane.

Anyway, we enjoyed it a lot, and it's also a hit here, I'm just sad that popularity of Pokémon is continuing to decrease here over time because the animé is not airing continuously. I hope that The Pokémon Company will fully allow GMA Network (who first aired the animé here  in the PH) to air the anime continuously once more just like the old days and not minding if they end up catching up with Cartoon Network PH for airing episodes. I want the kids of our generation feel the joy that we had on watching (and also playing) Pokémon.",0.716,278

You shouldn't have ignored the indian theme in this, A large section of the Pokemon fanbase (anime atleast) consists of Indians, as stupid as Indian youtube may seem (just put a video with a girl with some flashy title and boom 10 million views in 1 day ) there are still a lot of loyal fans who follow Pokemon and have played the main games as well. Please don't ignore us.
Sincerely 
A Pokemon fan from India",0.8726,87
