The Ant-Man & The Wasp Teaser Trailer Was Fantastic. Now I'm Definitely Excited For This Film. My Only Question Is. Does This Film Take Place Before Or After Infinity War?,0.4215,34
"The Black Panther reactions I've seen & read last night have been nothing but heartwarming, empowering and adds to my already high level of anticipation. So excited to see this world on the big screen and celebrated by comic book and non-comic book fans. And not to forget, the purple 'royal' carpet premiere was flooded with beautiful outfits and people. Shoutout to Ryan Coogler for rockin' that Ikiré Jones scarf, to (King T'Chaka) John Kani, and to the costume designers, cinematographers, etc interviewed. This art piece will no doubt do numbers and make an impact! #BlackPanther P.S. Lupita and Danai every time, whoooo boi 😍",0.8573,125
"The Kingkiller Chronicles are fantastic (especially the first book, The Name of the Wind). It is perfect for a television series, because the story is so sprawling and episodic. I question how the film is going to work though- and I'm not entirely confident in Sam Raimi directing it because fantasy can get cheesy fast, so you need a director with... restraint.",0.6657,72
The Kingkiller Chronicles are some the most elite fantasy writing of all time... just finished the second book! Check them out if you have any interest in fantasy literature. I think it might be a better tv show... these books are incredibly dense. Excited to see an adaptation either way!,0.8467,56
"The Name of the Wind wasn’t a musical, but music played a very important role in the story, so I’m glad Lin Manuel Miranda is on board. The rest of the plot of the book is kinda meandering though, so I’m curious how they plan on adapting it in a two hour movie. The main feeling I had when I finished the book was “wow, I just read almost 700 pages and pretty much nothing happened”... so we’ll see how this goes.",0.9616,100

"TimeForAReview I read Blood Song a while back and Gardens of the Moon last month, only the first books in their respective series though. I'll probably pick up the Malazan series again when I have time. Man, Erickson really throws in the deep end on page 1. I felt a little lost that first 100 pages or so. With Blood Song it was an issue with the audio book narration that kept me from going on but a good story. I'm so busy that 80% my books are in audio form, I'll give Anthony Ryan another look though. I'm always looking for good books and suggestions are always welcome. 
 Late last year I was into the Book of Destiny series (Cast under an alien sun), The White Tower, the latest entries of Kings Dark Tidings and one of my all time favorites The Expanse series (Persepolis Rising). 
This is one occasion that Movie Talk stumbled on to a topic about which I might consider myself a sweaty, lol.",0.9661,188
"TimeForAReview i'm pretty all major studio has their hands on the rotten tomatoes. They just won't tell you that straight up. Time warner, disney etc. Who cares about rotten tomatoes ratings. Trust your own viewing and personal reviewers outside of rotten tomatoes is the best option to me. Rating system don't mean shit in the real world eye viewers except for the studios and it employees. You as the viewer has to personally either like the movie or don't and just move on. No need to force opinions down each others throat.",0.837,101

Marvel may be formulaic, but in the last few years it always ends up being a well constructed film.",0.899,86

"WeasleyTwinsProductions Tim Gerard Reynolds is one of the few audio book readers that I don't need to listen to a sample before I pull the trigger. My favorite audio book series is Joe Abercrombie first law series narrated by Steven Pacey. The first book is The Blade Itself, takes a little getting used to but in my opinion it's the best pairing of reader and material I've ever heard. I've listened to it time and again. The subsequent novels after the trilogy that are set in the same universe were originally narrated by Michael Sullivan and I went back and re-bought them with Stephan Pacey narration, he's that good.",0.9127,116

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
