"@Stu B... Of course, YOUR post is completely nonsense.  Not everyone that voted for Trump bought into his theatrics and his lies.  They voted for him because they are struggling with nothing to lose and wanted change. Hillary was obviously not the change candidate, she tied herself to Obama the moment she officially started her campaign.  It doesn't take a genius to look at polling statistics and focus group data to understand what's going on.  The fact that the democratic primary was closed off to so many general election voters, it created an illusion that Hillary Clinton was not only the better candidate to Bernie Sanders, it also projected a false sense of security in which Hillary Clinton was not the riskier choice compared to Bernie.
If the people that voted in the general weren't restricted from voting during the democratic primary, then maybe a lot more people (majority Hillary supporters) would have seen the Hillary loss coming.

Mid-terms ARE coming up and voting in the democratic primary is still restricted.  If you care about replacing Trump, it would behoove the democrats to learn from there mistakes by listening to general election voters or be doomed to the same result.

So if you and Kerry really care about people voting, they maybe speak up now about the voting restrictions, purged voter rolls, etc within your own party.",0.042,249
"@black sparrow   Identity driven democrats seem to have this arrogant dismissal of statistically facts which is part of the reason why we all have Trump.  You think you can just ""label and dismiss"" your way back to power.  Saying ""conservatives are usually one issue voters."" is simply not objective reality.  I'm afraid those days are over.  Identity driven democrats are now gonna have to acknowledge objective reality to win.   Trump has ZERO social principles because he doesn't care.  At least all republicans know this.  Trump IS what people tell him to be.  He got the Evangelicals to turn out at 85% despite of his non-evangelic behavior.  Republicans sucked it up and voted with there party no matter what and it was a HUGE mistake for Hillary Clinton to waste her time chasing republican votes.  HUGE.  

If she nominated Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to her VP instead of Tim Kaine (a socially liberal republican), Trump would not be president today.  That one move lost her the election.  Hillary decided that she would much rather risk losing the presidency to Trump with a center-right VP than to seal the win with a progressive VP because she knew a progressive VP would hold her feet to the fire.   All Democrats have to acknowledge and accept this reality in order to not to repeat it.

2018 & 2020 are coming.  People are wising up to the Neo-Liberal gameplan of faux-change.  The middle class is being destroyed by both parties.  All democrats need to do is flip 1 out of every 50 Trump voters in Penn, Michigan, and Wisconsin to win in 2020.  And 9% of Trump voters voted for Bernie in the democratic primary.   FYI... Penn was a closed democratic primary won by Hillary.  Michigan (open primary) went to Bernie and Bernie landslided Hillary in Wisconsin (open primary).  

A progressive has to at least be on the ticket in 2020 in addition to all primaries must be open without restrictions or purges.",0.4382,369

This Justice Democrat organization started in part by TYT Co founder Cenk Uygur is really gaining momentum. Across the country with regular people running for office and not taking a single red cent. From any corporate or special interest backers nothing but small donations from the people they hope to serve in office.",0.9609,106
Charzard king01 I agree with you in the need for qualification. But I can also see how it is becoming more and more necessary to fight fire with fire and utilizes someone’s fame to get a good person elected who can atleast combat he horrific interests we’re seeing and who can atleast bring some decency to our politics. I don’t believe Oprah would be a good  fit anyhow. Politics is a dirty business and it will taint almost anyone who enters it. I don’t think even oprah is immune to that.,-0.1189,105

Charzard king01 I don't want Oprah to be president.... I'm just saying Trump is far less qualify and foolish then her.

"Wrong... 
She's married so it's ""Mrs.""
She didn't change her name during her marriage, so her last name is still ""Washington""

Therefore its... Mrs. Washington

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
