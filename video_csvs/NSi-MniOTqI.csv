"hello~ just a few tips:
- you should go to an asian market for rice, if you have one in your area. the prices are waaaay better than the bags that andrew showed you, which he probably got from trader joe's. at asian markets, you can buy a huge bag for cheaper, plus the brands in asian markets have quality ranks (which is hella important cause it determines its import prices). for jasmine rice, you should get the ""extra super quality three ladies brand."" for japanese rice, i'd recommend the kyoto brand (it's all in japanese lol so just look for the kanji for kyoto). also, if you get the chance, try blackberry rice! it's super nutritious and delicious. jasmine white rice, japanese white rice, red rice, black rice, and blackberry rice are my favorites.
- all soy sauces have different tastes! it's really up to you, but all brands have their own slight differences.
- ^^^^ same with fish sauce. pro tip: when the fish sauce in the bottle gets darker, that means it's old. don't take several months to use one!
- sesame oil is awesome for the korean salt/pepper dip, meat marinates, and finishing fried rice!
