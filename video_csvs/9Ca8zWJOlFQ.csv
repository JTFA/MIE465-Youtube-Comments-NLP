"One thing that people don't realize is that if you buy a phone with your contract, the cost is reduced significantly. For example, my iPhone X was half price with C-Spire, not to mention I traded in my old phone, bringing the cost (+$200 for Apple Care) to $600. And with Apple Care, if something happens to my phone, it's replaced free of charge. Most phones with wireless charging have glass backs, and I use a case so it's not a big deal for me. And honestly, the only headphones I use with my phone are the earbuds, which come with the phone so, once again, not a problem for me. And as you so well put it, the notch just disappears.",0.8979,145
