- Look this one up. I can't remember WHY this was determined. I know that it was done by NASA. Don't ask when. It was years ago. I remember because I was extremely excited. 

2) Intelligence is what allowed humanity to rise as the dominant species. If there are aliens out there (which is mathematically more probable) that have strength as a bigger portion of what makes them stay dominant as a species, then we will likely outclass them by far with technology by the time we find them. 

- Example? An ape is always stronger and faster than a human. But that doesn't matter when at the press of a button (and a turn of two keys, etc) we can nuke the jungle and extinct their entire species as well as dozens of others in the blink of an eye.

The assumption that advanced life (Life that's been around longer) would have the same colonial, conquering, assimilating attributes we have is just just hilarious. If that's the case there would be nothing we could do about it anyways. But finding a species or an entity with extra dimensional thinking or attributes would be amazing. And in no way negative as all we could do is try to learn from it. So the filter needs some retooling for bigger thinking.

"I don't think there is one ""Great Filter"" as mentioned and described in the movie...

I think there are several filters...

Each one becoming more and more challenging as Life becomes more and more complex...

Perhaps Humanity has a few more filters to get through before we can finally be a truly united and stable species...

Or be destroyed going through those filters...

This could explain why the Galaxy seems devoid of sentient and intelligent life like us...

Animal races and species will reach each level of those filters and barriers at some point in their evolutions, and either break through them, stagnate and plateau, or die off completely in the process...

Also, the success of sentient and intelligent life forms like ourselves may be completely dependent on the failure and dying off of other animal species in order for them to have the chance to grow, develop, and establish themselves...

Without the extinction of the dinosaurs, the mammals (including us humans) may never have had the chance to grow and develop like we did to where we are now as a race and species...

Our planet has gone through many hurtles and filters throughout it's 4.000.000.000+ years of existence to get where our race and species is now...

We still have more hurtles and filters to go through that will determine if our race and species will live or die as a whole...

One of those hurtles is simply learning how to get along with ourselves and one another...

A lesson we still haven't learned and are pretty much failing at...

I don't believe however that there is absolutely no other life at all within the Galaxy we live in...

Those who can't accept that there is other life beyond our planet once it is finally found are pretty much those who are in denial and can't handle change and the real truth when faced with it...

People refuse to believe a lot of things that were proven to be contrary to what they believe in...

It's only a matter of time before other life in the universe is proven to be true as well, and that we are not alone after all in a place of such big open space...

It's only a matter of time before Religions are fully and completely proven wrong as well... If they aren't being proven wrong and false already...

If anything... The proof of existence of life on other worlds other than our own may also prove that God and other Religions who believe in Gods are truly wrong and false altogether...

I don't think a Jew, Muslim, or a Christian will be able to ""spread the good news"" to other sentient intelligent life forms not from our world...

Especially when they have their own beliefs that contradict and conflict with our own...

Good way to start an unnecessary holy war or another crusade if you ask me...

Life outside of Earth will be the end of Religions...

"I just had a thought. If there is a great filter in front of us, something so obvious that all life forms would eventually take that path, then there is several obvious ways it could happen. One is creating matter. We know taking matter apart creates energy, and now we are working on creating matter from energy. What if that causes an unexpected result that wipes us all out. Another could be faster than light travel. We all heard of worm holes, teleportation, and gravity plane shifts to get us faster than light, but each has problems and possibly disastrous consequences.

Seriously though, is this not smelling of total bullshit to anyone else? By definition, the only thing that scientists have come up with that would qualify as a 'great filter' [something that would truly be impossible to surpass] is the eventual heat death of the universe.

If we find bacteria, that would mean that the filter between dead particles and simple life is not so great... or that that planet was able to get past it the same as us; If we found complex life, that would mean the filter between simple and complex life is not so great... or that they also surpassed it like us, and if we found dead civilizations (interesting how they're just gonna skip over the possibility of finding a live one.. it's just not possible that other bits of life could be on the same tech rung that we are, just very far away, apparently...) that would mean that they found the great filter that we are destined to also find...  or that they were killed off by a rival civilization. OR that they died on one of those 'roadblocks' you mentioned that we may or may not get caught on.

To say that there must be a 'great filter' just because the universe appears to be empty... I mean that's _basically_ like walking into a dark room you've never been in, and then deciding there must be a serial killer on the loose because you can't see anyone.

"The problem with the ""Great Filter"" hypothesis is that its not taken to its logical conclusion... there is a great filter at every stage of evolution, everything mentioned is a great filter, and it filters out 99% of all life at every stage.

Even if life is found on other planets, its not indicative of anything because the great filter hypothesis is based on the most common mistake of statistics. the statistical chance of A does not preclude the statistical chance of B subsequently also being true. 99% of life could die at stage 1, and then 99% of all that survive will die at stage 2, so on and so forth, humans by that measure are the 1 in a million chance, and Terry Pratchett quite accurately stated that 1 in a million chances tend to happen 9 times out of 10 (because the other 999,999 did not happen and hence wend unobserved).",0.9156,173

We, in the civilized part of the world, are not interested in them, either. So we don't visit them. For the same reason, galactic civilizations are not likely to visit uniplanetary species like us. They won't be interested in us.

Also, we are assuming that multiply and spread is a natural behavior of all organic beings, and that is not the case. Probably there are a lot of species which control their own populations and/or territory. Not all of them will be interested in conquer galaxies, nor growing exponentially in number of individuals.

"What if we are in the middle of one right now. It seems very likely to me that if there were a great filter, it would be most likely to be war among the planets own life. I think it's safe to assume most life at the very least has some sort of instinct to survive and even as early as molecular level, life tended to consume other life to live purely for the energy and resources. This, while I cannot be 100% sure, this seems to be the only trend  I can actually imagine being universal for all life or at least a popular thing. I am willing to guess if other planets have as many species on it as earth does, then it is rather likely that they will kill themselves until becoming civilized enough not to. Even if this is not that hard of a filter and life has made it through, it almost assuredly is enough to slow down the process of life growth.

"When I think about the Fermi Paradox I keep coming back to ""how much metallicity is needed?"".  Especially outside of galactic cores.  The galactic core is full of dangerous things like supernovae (due to the greater number of large stars), but those same supernovae are the source of elements higher up the table than helium, which are seemingly essential for life, and beyond that crucial for technological development.  Get dolphins smarter than humans and they are unlikely to develop technology because its hard to develop fire (and later smelting), and they don't have a good ability to manipulate even simple tools with their appendages, so another filter might be at least semi land based (so amphibians yes, cephalopods not so much), and yet another filter fine manipulation of objects.
