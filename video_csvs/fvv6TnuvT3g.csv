"As a physician, I would say that too many people look at life style changes and medications as separate options.  They are perceived and dichotomous opposed.  The reality is that both in combination are needed.  It does feel like in this video that doctors are blamed for starting medicines too early based off of clinic BP measurements that are inaccurate.  As one who does not sit in the ivory tower but lives in the front lines, much of the challenge is that despite asking patient to check home BP they in general don't, particular my poor patients.  So often times I will have to decide on pharmaceuticals based off of limited data.  This is my reality. 

With regard to the AHA/ACC, I actually think the oversimplified blood pressure goals and made a blanket statement.  I feel that they should of said that if a patient is older than 50 without diabetes or stroke and either has CKD, CVD, or framingham score >15 should have a goal of 120.  But they thought us doctors too dumb and said that 130 for everyone to make things simple.",-0.7285,204

"Healthy diet and exercise habits are always recommended as the first line treatment for hypertension. However, millions of people have hypertension that persists despite a healthy lifestyle. For instance, if you are born with arteries that have a narrow diameter then you might naturally have a higher pressure. 

Also, statin medications are effective in lowering blood cholesterol and low density lipoproteins thereby reducing the risk of conditions such as atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. They aren't actually useful in lower blood pressure.",-0.7823,90

"I'm not personally a fan of the SPRINT trial, and believe its unconventional method of measuring blood pressure is a fatal flaw that prevents drawing any definitive conclusions.  However, it was primarily funded by the NIH, and had no pharmaceutical support.

Thank you for this public service.,0.3612,7
"Thanks for pointing out that the methodology of studies matters, in this case, who could be enrolled in the study. The sections or terms to look for in a study publication or on clinicaltrials.gov are ""inclusion"" and ""exclusion"" criteria, meaning what conditions people had to have as well as could not have to be eligible for the study. It reminds me of a National Lampoon parody issue of Consumer Reports years ago. It rated an automaobile as ""unacceptable"" because it did not have outside rear view mirrors or space for a child car seat. They were rating a Formula One racer -- the criteria matter for the subject at hand. As for a dietary approach to lowering blood presssure, I suggest looking at the DASH diet, designed specifically for that purpose by the American Heart Association. There are no crazy or highly restrictive recommendations, just a guide to healthy eating in general. It nearly always comes out on top when dietary guidelines are rated.",0.743,185

"The ending to this video is absolutely amazing: too many times we consider the benefits of publishing a study without taking into the consideration the bigger picture or the risks associated with this type of fear messaging.
