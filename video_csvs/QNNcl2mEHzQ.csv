"I thought this movie was very good. Atmospheric, gritty and dark. Leto's character had that quiet, brooding, time bomb quality reminiscent of old Clint Eastwood western anti-heroes, or Ryan Gosling's character from Drive.

As for those complaining about the 'white guy joins Yakuza' plot, fyi it's kind of the point of the story, hence why it's called The Outsider.

"Shame to see such a potentially interesting story ruined.  While it's got nice sets and cinematography, it's storyline is a disaster.  Here's what I see wrong with this film:

1. It needs to be a series because clearly there is a lot of background that needs to be known for any of it to make sense.  Where did this guy come from?  Why is an American in a Japanese prison in the early 1950s?  Clearly his transition would have to take years; not weeks or months.  How does some low level non-member flunky get to talk to the head of a  crime family?  That never happens and for good reasons. 

2. It's preposterous.  The chances of a white guy who can't even speak Japanese of getting into the Yakuza are roughly equivalent to the chances of a black guy becoming a made man in the Mafia, exactly 0%, and for the same reason.  The Japanese don't like mingling with whites as equals. Japanese criminals really don't like it. 

3. They could've made the movie a thousand times more plausible by having the main character be a Japanese American who could speak Japanese work his way into the Yakuza.  But that would require the idiot white liberals who make movies to grasp that Japanese Americans are every bit as American as white Americans.  Which, of course, does not compute in the minds of the kind of patronizing, racist, liberal white jackasses who make movies.

All in all, then comes off like some self-hating white liberal fantasy of transitioning into another race.",-0.984,290

"The Outsider is by far the worst and most unrealistic ‚Äúmovie‚Äù Netflix ever did with so many inconsistencies and historical inaccuracies. It seems like Netflix conducted absolutely zero research on Japan and post war occupation dates. 
1. The US occupied Japan until 1952 (except Okinawa) but yet the movie is set in 1954. They do find a way to throw Anti-American propaganda with the helicopter overhead like they do in all Hollywood movies. It is a way of insinuating that America is an imperial country that is occupying a country for its selfish reasons. 
2. All the OG‚Äôs are seen openly carrying firearms throughout the ‚Äúmovie‚Äù. This was strictly against the law and still is in Nippon. 
3. The Yakuza is about as closed of a organization as possible. The idea that some some random American would be accepted into the oldest organized crime group is beyond absurd. Impossible. The  Japanese are extremely xenophobic to begin with and the idea that the equivalent of Lucky Luciano would accept a foreigner into his gang is ludicrous. Imagine Al Capone recruiting a Chinese man back in those days as his muscle/enforcer. Does anybody think this is cool? No. 
4. If he was a former POW WHY WAS HE IN A JAPANESE PRISON. A POW would have been rescued and repatriated. Their was SOFA (status of forces agreement) then like there is now, meaning when the Japanese authorities found out he was a soldier they would turned him to over to US Forces Japan, unless he was convicted of a serious crime. I 
5. Last but not least is Jared Leto; ‚Äúdo you speak Japanese?‚Äù..‚Äù a little‚Äù. Speaks zero Japanese the whole movie. Not even a Konichiwa or arigatou. Did someone say Leto has won a fancy Hollywood award. If that is true, then he needs to return that damn trophy immediately.  Leto is not a believable tough guy. Not for one second would anybody believe he is capable of beating someone down. 
Netflix should seriously consider pulling that movie from their app. It was as if I kept watching it because it was so horrible, no research conducted prior to the movie, horrible acting and the plot was so unfathomable that I couldn‚Äôt look away. Imagine Tom Cruise and the Last Samurai meet Leto and the Yakuza. Would never happen.
