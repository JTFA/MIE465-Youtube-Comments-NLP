The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends! 

Repent and believe in Jesus!
He loves us! He is not angry at us, and neither does He hate us. 

He came down to die for us, and on the 3rd day, He rose again. He assured us of our redemption! Hallelujah!

Find love, peace, and comfort in this Holy Truth!

He will save you from your sins, all you have to do is call upon Him. He will wash you, and make you new. He will deliver you! I have personally experienced The Lord's Working Power. He helped me overcome, and delivered me from all my sins. 

The Lord promises He will never drive anyone away, so don't let anyone stop you from coming to Jesus. 

He will also deliver you from
The oncoming judgement headed towards this earth. He already made a Way to escape; His Body on the cross. Thank You, Jesus!

So my friends, if you do not know Jesus as your Lord and Savior, make today you call upon Him in truth. You will be saved. No fancy prayer needed, just admit you need help and that you are sinner who has fallen short. The Lord will pick you up! He LOVES you. He is full of Mercy and Forgiveness. So don't be scared, be in AWE of The Lord! 

Shalom, friends.",0.9954,270

"That was a ""bit"" a made up story comics often use. Either you are very old or you may simple just be very...special. I respect people who earn my respect your sex doesn't not afford you my respect. Needless to say the first comment was not disrespectful in any sense of the word. If you said it about a man i would laugh because anyone intelligent would see it was a joke about being married. You on the other hand strain your small intellect to make it a horrible thing to feed you victim complex. At no point in my joke did i call the  hypothetical woman a name or do anything disrespectful. You on the other hand have slandered me telling me how i am based on a few words. In-fact you don't know if I am a woman or not, what you see is a handle used by a person you do not know. You seek to judge when you think yourself better than. I would say you your self have been more disrespectful than I. Nancy i think you should talk to your therapist about this... you seem to be lashing out at what you assume is a man based on a very docile joke. It seems possible some pent up rage towards the opposite sex is the cause. Maybe you hate your husband or couldn't get one. Or perhaps one hurt you and you seek to vilify all. I think at the end of the day this comes down to the fact you do not grasp humor. If that is so I am sorry everything will always offend you delicate snowflake soul.
