It works really well and doesn't mess with the consistency.",0.1675,70

"Your ideas are always useful and tasty!! Can I suggest another challenge for one of your future videos? In my country buttercream is not a favourite kind of fillings or frostings. But it seems very suitable to ice a cake as it gets firm very quickly and as a filling it makes the levels very straight. 
So the question is: can you find a delicious kind of cream that is not so sweet and greasy but still steady??
Thank you in advance!!! ",0.8378,93
