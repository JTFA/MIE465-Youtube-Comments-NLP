"First song I've heard, they're pretty good",0.7269,8
"For songs that sound like this check out their 2003 album “A Mark a Mission a Brand a Scar” (a mouthful I know but so worth it). Also from their albums Dusk and Summer (2006) and Alter the Ending (2009). I would also highly recommend their even older stuff, like their first ep “So Impossible EP”, “Swiss Army Romance”, and “The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most”. Their earlier stuff is more just Chris the lead singer and an acoustic guitar, but it’s  so worth it. I hope you check them out, they’re seriously amazing!",0.9615,125

"The Lord Jesus Christ is COMING, my friends!

Repent of your sins and put your faith in Him!
He is NOT angry at you! HE LOVES YOU!

He died and rose again for us, so that we may live forever with Him! Hallelujah!

Whatever you are going through in life, The Lord wants to be involved. He is waiting on you to call upon Him, He WILL save you! You will be washed, you will be redeemed!
The Lord has delivered me through all my sins and addictions, this is why I am sharing here with you all, that my Lord truly loves us!

So please make today the day you call upon Jesus in truth, you may not get another chance.
Judgement is swiftly approaching, and Jesus came to make a Way for us to escape, and we can only escape by the Only Way out - through Jesus Himself. He took all of our punishment upon Himself. THANK YOU, JESUS! AMEN!
To die without The Lord Jesus Christ is very dangerous!

Shalom, friends!",0.9643,204
