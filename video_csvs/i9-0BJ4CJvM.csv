"Advertisers pay big money to sponsor the NFL and rightfully expect a return for their investment. The sponsor has every right to speak out against the behavior of the NFL if that behavior causes them loss rather than the expected gain. It's too bad PaPa John's can't sue for the losses. Schnatter built the company from nothing and is naturally upset to see it take losses over the bad behavior of the NFL.
The new CEO agrees that the losses may well have been the result of the anthem protest so what in Hell are these fools afraid of?",-0.9725,104

"Besides his outcry, I never really liked the founder. I know that he is a bit unresponsive and had a lot of trouble In the past. Honestly, like a business person shouldn‚Äôt blankly state something that is politically correct in their views.",-0.4676,49

"DON RAMON DE KHALIFAS excellent retort! Although I find your existence, much more *offensive, than your stupid comment! Please don't respond. For your own sake!",0.5386,32
"Don you're a typical millennial, know nothing, do nothing loser, sitting in your box, lashing out at the world. You are obviously delusional in your own world, yet to continue to babble off nonsense as if it were actually true.¬† I guess it's true in your world, whatever world that might be. I guess it gives you some sort of mental relief categorizing everyone that sees your BS, into some sort of box that fits your whacked out narrative. Mother's basement, liberal?¬† That might be your world, but you clearly don't know me, my politics or my history. Get back on your meds, ask mommy for another PB&J, and try to wake from your slumber and do something with your life.",0.6953,142

"He should just say fuck it, and shut the whole fucking thing down.  Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you.  I've made my money  effective immediately Papa John's is longer doing business.  Take his money, his fucking Camaro get drive off into the Sunset.  Thisshit is getting ridiculous, meanwhile Hillary and Podesta are STILL trafficking children and FUCKING little kids!!!",-0.9386,71

"Hopefully enough people will agree with that, so that Kathy Griffin can bounce back. I don't want to have to fly to another country to see her preform because no one in the U.S ill hire her.",-0.0057,42
I guess turning Papa John's into the official eating establishment for Neo-Nazis was not the best way to sale more pizzas huh?,-0.5216,23
"I know the truth hurts Don. Maybe some day you will actually accomplish something in this world on your own.¬† But for now, just sit back, bask in the glory others have earned for you and lob worthless insults.¬† Seems that's the only thing you can do.",-0.0516,53
"I will always resent Papa John's for their branding nonsense of ""Papa Slams"" ... sure I could blame MLB At Bat for sending stupid notifications when other baseball teams hit a grand slam, but trying to co-opt a four run homer with your brand identity?  That's wrong.  This is America, and I will not purchase a pizza because you try to buy the language of a sport.",-0.8126,74
"Mad paul, just sit there in your comfortable life, bought and paid for by the veterans¬†and their families who gave it to you.¬† Now you can point the finger of ""morality"" while you bask in it's rewards.",0.4939,44

TheCwhite137 why should anyone respect a flag covered in blood? You obviously lack the ability to think for yourself. Do you boycott Khazarian goods after their attack on the USS Liberty?,0.3527,35
"Want to know a secret? Schnatter wasn't ousted for his comment. Likewise, the PZZA ticker wasn't in decline because of less NFL viewership. The stock isn't likely to bottom before crossing below $50. Maybe even $45. But once it does, I'd wager on a full recovery. Hope this helps someone.",0.7351,61
"We have entered a new age of censorship.¬† I will never order another papa john pizza because of this. This man has the right to speak the truth. NFL and its sponsors need to realize they have a fanbase that is outraged over it's behavior, and someone with guts has to stand up and do the right thing. Boot players that don't respect the flag.",-0.5795,71
"Well, Don, I am happy to disappoint you that I am a raging heterosexual (I like women in case you didn't know what that meant). And being a veteran, I can say your ""family members"" that served are probably very disappointed in you.
