Apparently Utah didn't have somebody to do the job good thing they brought Mitt in to do itt. I think some of you need to probably should do your research.

The only thing Russia seriously threatens is the US military's illegal proxy and regime change wars in the Middle East that have harmed innocent people and create massive amounts of refugees that flood into Europe.

Russia has the approval of the Syrian government to assist in stabilizing the country, while the US is there illegally. Mitt Romney supports interventionist military policy like this that has proven to do more harm than good in the Middle East over the last decades. Vote for Mitt if you want more of this.
