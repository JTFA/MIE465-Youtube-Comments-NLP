+Frikzo Even if you were the most oblivious around you have to be aware that you represent the shit in this equation purposefully spreading your toxic and moronic opinion where it is no good for anyone.,0.25,38
"+Frikzo Its not about sticking to anything, but simple logic. If you have a shit attitude and behavior (which is necessary to spew the bile you did in op) then naturally your opinion will likely be toxic garbage.

Normal people who don't like a song or artist simply does not listen and watch their videos while you spend time writing comments for what ever reason. This is not exactly what healthy people with good judgement does so we can of course not trust your opinion either (which is painfully obvious considering how ridiculous it is).",-0.9584,105
"+Frikzo Just as you projected shit in your op here you are projecting your inbreeding as well. 
Inbreeding give a high risk of mental disturbances which could make someone susceptible to develop sociopathy which could explain the garbage you spew in your op.",-0.7184,46

"Just like in the movies
It starts to rain
We're the broken beauties
Blindfolded minds collide and we fall

When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our stories after the end

Like strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Memories in photos
Too easy to rewrite
Left us lonely shadows
Holding each other tight and we fall

We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Think we got it but we're made of a dream
Cause we've got a feeling of what we could be
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
Think we got it but we're made of a dream
Cause we've got a feeling of what we could be
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Not like in the movies
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
