So please, if you do not know Jesus as your Lord and Savior, make today the day you call upon Him in truth. You will be saved! You will be forgiven! You will become new! Hallelujah! 

He knows what you're going through, and cares a lot more than what you think. He is waiting on you to call on Him. He will come! He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so don't let anyone stop you from seeking Jesus today.
