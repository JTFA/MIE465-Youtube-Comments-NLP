"As much as I hate working at a fast food joint dealing with customers that manager has gone too far. I currently work at a burger joint and something similar to that has happened to me while I was taking this assholes order a few months ago. On that day this guy pulled up to the drive thru and I answered his call I said ""How can I help you?"" He said something and I couldn't hear him at all because the motor of his car was too loud and then I said, ""I'm sorry sir I can hardly hear you, is it okay if you can pull up to the window and order it from there?"" Somehow he got annoyed and yelled out in rage ""I JUST WANT TWO FUCKING ROOT BEERS!"" I yelled out ""JESUS CHRIST!"" and then he said ""I wanna speak to your manager!"" Then he pulled up and my manager took his order. I was so glad I didn't get in trouble because the manager hated him too.",-0.8854,194

"Ben, when a customer uses profanity which she die prior to taping they have every right to kick them out. However you are right the manager does need to be fired. But the woman needs her children taken away from her. Apparently she took her anger towards the manager out on her daughter because her daughter needed to use the washroom and they had to go back. Then she accused the BK manager of making her so angry that she took her anger out on her child.",-0.9696,93
Both customer and manager are in the wrong. But when the mother beat her child because she was angry at the manager she should have called the police.

She refused to leave when asked. Then when she finally left, her child asked to use the washroom. She started cussing at her child,  pulled her hair and threw her to the floor and blamed the manager for forcing her to hurt her child because the manager made her too angry to think straight.

"Madmax578 I can appreciate your scenario and I agree with your point about knowing what foods kids eat, but I have a different take on things. If your kids don‚Äôt get takeout very often then they don‚Äôt know what kinds of choices the menu has and that takes a second. The woman says there was no one else in line, so she didn‚Äôt feel rushed and probably took the time to read items off to the kids. All of that is acceptable behavior at a fast food joint. I waited tables and then because a manager at a restaurant many years ago and I know for sure this one thing hasn‚Äôt changed‚Äîyou do not treat customers like this! If this manager gets ticked off over something as small as a slowpoke orderer just maybe this isn‚Äôt the job for her. She probably thinks that corporate will not care and she will be proven wrong. Corporate knows incidents like this can have an effect on their bottom line and they will wonder if she is not following policy in this then she probably will not follow policy somewhere else and they love their ‚Äòcorporate laws.‚Äô Mean people suck!",-0.9089,223
