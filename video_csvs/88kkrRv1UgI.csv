"Hypothetically speaking uploading your mind is pointless unless it is to be used as a autonomous AI. Conscious you (real you) wouldn't benefit from uploading your mind because you wouldn't be able to experience what uploaded you would. once (real you) passes away, everything that makes you, you goes with it and uploaded you would continue on as if real you was just a stranger with similar past experiences. Real you wouldn't experience anything uploaded you would and vice versa because neither real you or uploaded you are linked together or have the ability to share experiences. Once you pass that is it, you're gone and no chance to further experience what uploaded you will. At that point Uploaded you would just exist, where as Biological you either already passed on your genetic code (DNA) and completed life's final goal: sustaining life, or you didn't and your genetics cease at biological you. Unless Uploaded you has the ability to pass on genetics also via sperm/egg storage or copy itself with minor defects in the digital code to introduce variances much like how life does with mutations in which it would require twice as much storage. Granted if uploaded you even has the ability to further increase neural pathways and learn new things without filling up its storage space would be rather interesting. If all humanity uploaded their minds the power required to fulfill that would be astronomical. We would have to jump to a type 4 civilization just for the power requirements and technology which I would highly doubt we would ever achieve purely because Humanity is to concerned about what pronoun to call someone and resorting to violence when someone gets it wrong. Plus humanity is really good at killing each other so half the technology predictions are rather optimistic.",0.4509,326
"I believe you have pushed the idea forward too fast... What most probable thing will have is we will start to substitute all body parts with mechanical parts and eventually the brain will be substituted by a full working ""computer"". The idea of uploading and have a copy will not make any sense. But extend your life forever make the biological sense. If the upload work, it may become a backup in case your brain get destroyed or something similar. I´m speaking from the biological point of view... So, I suggest you make another video as an extension of this one. When you will not be you anymore after so many parts exchanges. If you lose 100% of your body (mechanically or not), your backup can continue to live?",-0.6369,148

Plus, humanity would need to keep pockets of about 2,500 people for breeding age alive within a six month walking distance or there wouldn't be enough genetic diversity to protect humanity from genetic damage due to inbreeding.

Now, assembly lines are more procedure than machine and we're probably not too far gone to survive the loss of computers.  But once you get rid of the steam engine, everybody dies.

"You guys can see the positive side of this, but imagine the negative side. Have you watched White Christmas, an episode on Black Mirror? Your consciousness can be uploaded to a ""Cookie"", basically a digital room where you can kept for eternity. Time can be made faster than reality, so 1 minute can equal to 1000 years. You'll have emotions, you'll be just like a real person, but with nothing to do, totally alone, for a very, very long time. This is terrifying.
Yes, I know this will take a long time to do, but eventually it will be possible. You might say that people won't let this happen, and that there will be laws and rights for AI. But imagine, a little computer, not bigger than a pair of headphones, hidden somewhere in a room, offline. Who can detect that? 
More beings can be added when these ""Cookies"" are advanced and can run more minds, but when it is new, the people who run them will have to run extremely small simulations with only 1 person. Basically, a person sitting in a box for a million years. You can't die, or sleep, or harm yourself, or break the box, you can't experience hunger of thirst too, because all of it is just code.

"what ive been imagining throughout this video is, if i copy paste my brain to a computer and say, i abuse it, like verbally, how sure am i that the negative impact on that brain will be the same as mine. does our willpower controlled by our brains? so the will to choose...will it be the same? will our track of thoughts will be the same? 
and say when i upload it, i can make it more honest, will i be able to actually learn and know more about myself from the robot?  if the robot knows i'm the biological one and she's the robot one, won't that affect the robot?",-0.3542,126
