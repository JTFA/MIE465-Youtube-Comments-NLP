"Rassmussen, IBD/TIPP Polls: Americans ‚ÄòOverwhelmingly‚Äô Believe Obama ‚ÄòImproperly Surveilled‚Äô Trump Campaign
http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/10/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-believe-obama-improperly-surveilled-trump-campaign/
by John Nolte                10 Feb 2018

An IBD/TIPP poll shows that ‚ÄúAmericans overwhelmingly believe the Obama administration ‚Äòimproperly surveilled‚Äô Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign.‚Äù

Despite the disgraced American media‚Äôs best and most cynical efforts to bury the truth, and to even stop the truth from ever seeing the light of day, this poll (and another addressed below) demonstrate that the American people are almost entirely tuning the partisan, mostly-hysterical news media out and looking to alternative media for the truth.

There is simply no other way to explain these poll results, which unambiguously prove that a majority of the public believe the exact opposite of what an unceasing, coordinated media campaign wants them to believe ‚Äî which is that President Trump colluded with the Russians to win the 2016 campaign and that the heroic FBI is being unfairly smeared by Trump‚Äôs  defenders.

Well, despite more than a year of this relentless propaganda coming from all four corners of the mainstream media‚Äôs fabricated reality, here are the results from all four corners of actual reality‚Ä¶

A clear majority of 55% believe it is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù that the Obama administration ‚Äúimproperly surveilled the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.‚Äù That includes 31% of Democrats, 87% of Republicans, and 55% of Independents.

A clear majority of 54 percent want a special counsel to investigate ‚Äúwhether the FBI and the Department of Justice improperly surveilled the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.‚Äù Only 44% said no. The partisan breakdown shows that 74% of Republicans and 50% of Independents want a special counsel ‚Äî as do a full 44% of Democrats.

In this particular poll, one fairly positive result for the FBI and Justice Department is that only 35% believe these institutions attempted to outright frame President Trump for colluding with the Russians.

A just-released Rasmussen poll, however, shows that a full 50% of Americans ‚Äúbelieve it‚Äôs at least somewhat likely senior federal law enforcement officials broke the law in an effort to prevent Donald Trump from winning the presidency.‚Äù Only 40% disagree.

Another Rasmussen poll from this week shows that only 42% of Americans believe Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election more than the FBI. Moreover, a full 34% believe the FBI meddled more than the Russians, while 24% are unsure.

In other words, we now live in a country where 58% of Americans either believe our own FBI meddled in a presidential election more than a hostile foreign government, or are not sure the FBI did not.

Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs approval rating is running ahead of former-President Obama‚Äôs at this point in his failed presidency.

"Wendy S They told us that the world was going to end. They told us nuclear holocaust was going to consune the world and destroy everything. They told us that american government as we know it would be permanently changed and the county that we loved would be permanently destroyed. Well as it turns out only one of those is partially true. The american government as we knew it before 2017 has completely changed but its been changed for the better. All the things i mentioned above were leftist mantras before the election and before the inauguration of president trump. Despite their fear mongering and doomsday prognostication things are actually going pretty well in the u.s after his first year. There is only two thing that trump can do to lose my support. One give amnesty to illegals aliens. Two get us involved in another pointless war. So allow me to give you an analysis of trumps presidency. I will identify the strengths and weaknesses, and the areas he failed. Trump has done a lot of great things but he isn't perfect. 

So with that said lets break his presidency down into six categories. administration, economics, domestic policy, foreign policy, immgration, and meta poltics.

Trump has done an adiqute job of managing his administration. After a few rough initial months. The administrative staff seems to generally be doing a good job John Kelly appears to have cracked down on the leaks coming out of the white house and is enforcing a tough code of conduct. Also he is preventing ivanka and jared from having influence on the white house. Unfortunately I'm not such a fan of Sarah Huckabee Sanders as press secretary as i listen to her she doesn't strike me as overwhelming competent and comfortable adressing the issues. Also she doesn't have the ability like Steve miller to manipulate and humiliate reporters. However she hasn't made to many mistakes so i can't be that hard on her. As for the rest of trumps cabinet things are generally going well. The person i do have a few problems with is jeff sessions. He began the year by recussing from the russia investigation which was a key mistake. considering how it allowed rob roseinstein to appoint rob muller. The doj also declined to prosecute Lois Lerner the former head of the irs for her unlawful targeting at the irs during the obama administration. Which was a big mistake as well as the failure to hashtag lock her up goes without saying. I'm not a fan of Christian Nilsson at the dhs she has a tendency to constantly voice her opinion on immgration policy which isn't her job. A bit more deportation and a little less political commentary please. 
Overall i give trump a 3/5 on appointment and overall management.

I'll admit i was not the world biggest fan of the gop tax plan. I think the corporate tax cuts should have been combined with tariffs and incentives for company's to move their factorys back to the u.s. The gop tax bill actually incentives companies to sell to foreign markets instead of america. While simultaneously lower their tax burden. It seems like a better deal could have been reached here. Aside from that the gop tax bill was generally quiet good as a healthy person i don't need health insurance. The repeal of the government mandate was a big win for me and millions of americans. I like the individual tax cuts obviously and i like the tax credits for having children. Increasing birth rates will be essential for the american future and making it easier for middle class familys is a good move. Many people are crediting trump with the success of the stock market i am generally weary of this strategy since their are millions of factors impacting stock prices. You don't want your administration to be held politically acountable if it were to crash. It is undeniable however that the stock market is going up as is consumer and business confidence. The Trump administration is making it more difficult for foreign workers to come here and take jobs that could be filled by anericans this obviously is a good thing. 
Here i would give Trump a 4.5/5 2017 started off with the death of the trans Pacific Partnership and this year i would like to see more focus on tariffs to bring manufacturing jobs back to america.

Next is domestic policy, the trump administration has not pursed many domestic policy objectives. One of the major attempts to change domestic policy was the attempted repeal of Obamacare. However as we all know that didn't work out so well, but Obama was effectively repealed later with the removal of the individual mandate. Trump and his administration simply haven't made alot of changes here, one area of domestic policy where trump really did impress me was his reaction to the Charlottesville rally. Instead of doing what every other weasel politician did and condemning thise who went to Charlottesville trump did the honorable thing and stood firm. He told the truth, there were good and bad people on both sides. And that the violence was brought primarily by the left. I do disagree ""suposed"" war on weed but ultimately there is no war on weed. I doubt his choice to allow federal prosecutor investigate individuals for pot will actually result in more productions. Prosecutors know they have better things to do than go after marijuana users.
I have to give Trump a hood grade here in 2018 i would like to see him domestic policy such as national conceal and carry reciprocity and something similar to paul nelans anti-censorship legislation for social media companies. I give trump a 4/5

Now for foreign policy, this one started kind rough. The missile strikes in syria were a really bad move. Thankfully however they did not lead to a prolonged engagement. Trumps signalling support for the iran protests was shortsided and indicates that he hasn't learned a lesson from America's past backed revlotions. Thankfully no action was taken. Also the u.n appointment Nikki Haileys making threats to other nations over support of Israel was horrible. It would be nice to have a u.n ambassador that acted in our interests first. The war against isis is nearly over and the middle east is stabilizing. We're getting along great with key asian partners. However i do wish we were doing more to build up our relationship with russia. There is no reason to continue this advisory political theater. In 2018 i hope trump invites Putin 
To the white house for a visit.
I can't give a prefect grade here for reasons previously mentioned but its still a 4/5

Immigration for me it is the most important issue. Understand that the way we as americans discuss immigration is in the middle of a massive paradigm shift. Americans never got to decide wether or not we wanted to change from a European American country to a multicultural mess of a country. fortunately people are now questioning this. President trump has been making a lot of good pro american changes on immigration policy. Obviously DACA is currently the topic of contention. With democrats going as far to shut down the government over protections for illegal alliens and future Democrat voters. The jury is still out on wether DACA will be put into law by trump i doubt it will but politicians are capable of going back on their promises. As previously mention h1v visas are getting harder to get. This is great news american tech workers deserve to be the ones getting these jobs not foreign workers. Plus a shortage of labor will help raise wages in this feild. The trump administration is also working on removing people who were only suposed to be here temporarily. Including Haitian then Salvador migrants in addition the 2020 census will only count americans and not illegal alluens which will drastically remove the power of illegal magnet states such as California and Illinois. Its a little hard for me to give a definitive grade gere since we are in the middle of this massive immigration debate. I like the direction the talks are going in and i like trumps refusal to not include the wall. Based on what we've seen so far and how he has changed the debate on immigration like no Republican ever would i have to give him another 4.5/5 now. Let me make it clear if he flips on DACA or the border wall if goes from a 4.5 to a zero. Immigration is a issue that shapes all of our other issues. No country will stay the same when mass immigration is forced on it. 

Now for meta poltics and the state of the American poltical discussion. Trump hasn't been prefect on any administrative issue he has been nearly perfect on the way he has shaped the american poltical landscape. In the first year of the trump presidency we have seen a complete democratization, lose of identity, and fracturing of the american left. Now that they are out of power their various idenity groups are fighting each other. We've also seen a complete demolition of the Overton window. It was unthinkable that the republicans would take a hard line and want to cut back on legal immigration. Now its basically part of the party platform. The republican party that has been out of touch with its voting base for the last 2 decades now realises what it has to do to stay relevant. They have to listen to their constituents rather than their donors. G.W.B neo-conservatism is dead largely thanks to trump. No President is perfect and i have had issues with trump this year but he's doing as good of a job as you can expect. Considering he has had to battle almost single handedly against a system dominated by rootles tran-national globalist ellites and their cronies. I give trumps first year a solid 4.25/5 he's playing the long game in hopefully three or seven years that number will go up.",0.9398,1815

Does that mean we shouldn't try to limit it as much as possible? If Kennedy thought like you, the world would've ended decades ago. We knew that if Hillary lost, she'd accept it. If Trump lost, he'd throw a petty rich boy tantrum. That's the whole point. It was about the candidates, not the voters.

"You're not a racist by my logic. You're a racist by logic. There is no my logic. There is only logic, and it has rules. You fit the definition of a racist. When Trump called Mexicans rapists, he didn't include other races in that comment, you dense prick. He was specifically insulting Mexicans. Your idea of ""allowing citizens to defend their life"" has deadly consequences. Are you ignoring the plague of gun violence we suffer from here? And terrorism in Europe is due to proximity, not their immigration policy. It's important to note that we should vent for terrorists. We should not vent for Muslims, however. And no, not everyone is racist. Don't assume everyone is as racist as you. Racism is a taught weakness. There are plenty of people who aren't that stupid and weak. There won't be a race war. If it does come to that, there will be racist whites vs everyone else or more likely, racist whites vs the police for a few minutes. Haiti is not a shithole country. Those people have been repeatedly beaten down by colonization and nature itself, yet they endure. It would be a privilege if one of them wanting to live and work in America. I can't afford luxury vacations, and you should know better than to accuse me of referencing that. It is significantly harder to become a citizen here compared to Canada and Mexico. What are you talking about? Did someone teach you wrong as a joke? And why would we need to go back to 18th century thinking for everything? That's not cherry picking. I'm not citing the founders as an infallible source. Most of them were pricks and they got a lot of stuff wrong. Welcoming immigrants isn't wrong. Freedom isn't wrong. Jefferson advocated that homosexuals be castrated. That is objectively wrong. Washington owned slaves. That's objectively wrong. We're allowed to recognize right and wrong. Cherry picking what's right and wrong is only bad when you claim to live your life by a single source like religious texts. The constitution and this countries history isn't infallible. There were good parts and bad parts. Recognizing the difference is how we progress.
