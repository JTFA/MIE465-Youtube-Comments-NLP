"+Alex Smith Are you really that ignorant and entitled? Because it had been far more hushed up and underrreported in the past. That recently it's become a vocal issue (and now not just for rape, but for sexual assault and misogyny too) brings awareness and attention of something that has been happening for decades. You can through in the reality that female college (and workplace) enrolment has been consistently rising which increases the likeliness of these events even more.
I don't want to sound like an SJW and use words like ''mansplain and male privilege'', but god damn; there's never been a better example than your comments. Just pure ignorance.",-0.7565,128

"Ain't no Slice the evidence is surveys conducted by people that aren't ideologues asking people if they were victims of rape. There is no ""hushing up"" in a victim survey. It is regarded as the gold standard for the very reason it bypasses police reporting, ""hushing up"" and other authoritarian interference. And the surveys show that rape is is dropping and is far lower on colleges than outside of them. And what the hell would my theoretical privilege have anything to do with that? Just listen to yourself. You sound like a religious person spouting passages from the bible which you've heard over and over again but which make no sense. Solutions based on lies don't help victims, it harms them and others.",-0.9389,137

"Fraternities are not about women and girls, its male bonding. The chant is trolling, if you don't like it or take it seriously then don't go to their parties. 

But women want to be at those parties because they want access to charismatic, powerful and well-off boys. You can't have it both ways. 

You can't make someone deal with you on your terms, they will only deal on theirs. You have the option not to date or party with them, those should he your terms. 

Complaints about sexual assault not being taken seriously is bullshit. Dozens, maybe even hundreds, of boys are expulsed each year for things they were just accused of without evidence. 

It sounds to me like these women need to go to an all girls college.",-0.7663,145

"Hey, I hate people who sexually harass and get away with it, but I gotta say that these situations are completely avoidable. If you know that a fraternity has a ‚Äúrape reputation‚Äù then don‚Äôt go party at that fraternity. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Don‚Äôt expect to be treated like royalty when you literally go solo or even with a friend to such events, and also the excuse that ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt know better‚Äù is complete BS.

"It is unfortunate that they feel unsafe but I don't think that the risk of damaging someones reputation and character over a potential false allegation is the answer.

"Women are afraid of stigma? Have they looked at the present day climate and the fact that male college students are routinely ""tried"" on charges of rape and sexual assault with little in the way of qualified investigation, actual evidence, or proper legal representation? Rape and sexual assault are terrible things, but everyone is supposed to be given the presumption of innocence in this country. 

Additionally, what some people might consider as creepy or inappropriate may not be illegal or technically wrong. The resent story involving Aziz Ansari is prime evidence of that. Was what he doing kind of sleezy in a way?  I suppose depending on your perspective, but he didn't do anything illegal or outright morally objectionable.  He asked for sex and tried to encourage her to engage with him in that but she didn't give direct answers at first, and when she finally responded firmly in the negative he responded reasonably. 

Perhaps part of the issue is that women need to change their expectations and behavior in that area as much as men need to change theirs.  A truly balanced compromise can only be reached if both sides give equally, and with regards to any sort of legal or para-legal matter by the state or some other governmental agency or other institution: the rights of the accused must be upheld and respected; as two wrongs do not make a right.",0.7061,254
