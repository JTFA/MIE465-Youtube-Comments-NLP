"Beautiful. Wanya gave charlie his stamp of approval at 3:30. this is what makes beautiful music, the ability to see past race and ethnicity and convene to reach common ground and just make beautiful sounds for the world to hear. i listen to music like this to remind me that the world isn't as messed up as the news says it is.  thank you for never giving up on this horrible industry Boyz II Men.

"There are definately elements of some kind of Heterozygote Hybrid Combination / Amalgamation - in ""If You Leave Me Now"" - 

of - 

R. Kelly - I Believe I Can Fly - 

and - 

Take 6 - A Quiet Place - 

Some 1940's Classical to Mid - Term Era Disney Musics - 

Mixed In with a little bit of - 

Stevie Wonder - 

and/or - quite possibly 

some earlier  - 

Phil Collins - like - may be - the - True Colours - Acapella Medleys - ? - potentially - I do not know - only you can tell us/me - haha - 

may be - 

some Michael Jackson -",0.7964,119
"There aren't a lot of people in our generation who appreciate any of the best era's of music - you are awesome man,",0.9001,24
"There aren't many kids these days in our generation who appreciate any of the original era's of music - it's a good job that my parents were that musically orientated as well ey - they were almost identical it seems to yours in the sense that - they were both classicaly trained musicians - and in one part of the day as a kid - it was a case of Claude De Bussy (most likely Claire De Lune) in the morning (in the Week Days - before school) - or Gustav Holst - The Planets Suites - in the morning in the weekends - 

get home - a little bit of Disney - Paul Dukas - Fantasia - followed by some Jungle Book - I Want To Be Like You - 

and then suddently it was  a little bit of - (1990's homage here) - Daft Punk - One More Time - next - some 1990's ( pretty much all 1970's Jazz - Based / Inspired) Rhythm And Blues - R. Kelly - I Believe I Can Fly (obviously in homage to Space Jam) - followed by - Ghost Town Dj's - My Boo - coming on the Radio in the middle of the day -  The Backstreet Boys - everybody at school pretty much, with some friends inadvertently listening to Five - Keep On Moving - all listening to our Cassette Tapes - ALBA Walk Mans - and/or - CASIO Cassette Tapes Walk Mans outside in the Astro Turf courts - 

and then getting home - the parents sitting in the offices (coming out of their Technics Vinyl Record Players) - with a little bit of The Temptations on - next up Bill Withers - next up - Lionel Ritchie - Earth Wind And Fire - Full Force - Stevie Wonder - Miles Davis - Chick Corea -  Next Up - John Williams?!?! (The master of course) - randomly, some Jurassic Park - and then some Star Wars - a little bit of Hook - The Extra Terrestrial - Indiana Jones - with an epic ultimatum of Superman - 

then paying homage to Sir William Walters - The Battle In The Air - watching The Battle Of Britain as a kid to just pretty much analyze each Reciprocating Piston Engine Bi - Plane and try to further link it's anecdotal associations with George Lucas mysterious connections in it to his original Star Wars franchises -  

then the weekly stint of Top Gun per protocol - Take My Breath Away - Berlin on the VHS Videos Cassette Tape Player - 

Grand Parents come over for the Week End and my Grand Dad starts playing a Jazz Swing version of Edvardo Greig - Piano Concerto in A Minor - Opus Number 16 - with the first 20 seconds regular and then suddenly breaking out it to some Jazz Swing overture rendition (obviously his own personal one, indubitably) - and then breaking out in to another Jazzified Swing version of Fly Me To The Moon - Frank Sinatra on the Grand Piano - 

play a little bit of the orginal Game Boy colour - later watching with the mini-crew - some Celebrity Death Match in the middle of the night - and all subsequently trying to stupidly replicate said choreography in real life and videoing it on the Retro Video Recorder Camera - combined with obviously - The Rock Dwayne Johnson's - People's Elbow - because all of these neo-aged Superficial Millennials - are - well just - pretty much - JABRONIES - 

watch a little bit of Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Toonami, Trouble (Keenan And Kel, Saved By The Bell, Recess, Hey Arnold, Dragon Ball Z, Dexters Laboritory, Courage The Cowardly Dog, Johnny Bravo, Ani-Maniacs, Cow And Chicken, The Fresh Prince Of Bell-Air, My Wife And Kids, Naruto, Pokemon, Digimon, Gun Dam Wing) - 

some - Biker Mice From Mars, then - The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, Captain Planet, Captain Scarlet, Thunderbirds, Looney Toons, Disney, 

play on a little bit of the (Platform Style) - Sega - Mega Drive (I think that you guys call it the Sega - Super Saturn may be / possibly?) - Play Station 1, Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Atari, Commodore 64, Sinclair Spectrum) - with the friends - 

and then by the self - in the evening - some online Strategy Games - Command And Conquer - Age Of Mythology - 

and some friveoulous ones - Rollercoaster Typhoon - The Sims - 

and a little bit of online Frivelities - Runescape - Neopets - 

followed by replacing School Work in classes with making Adobe Flash Videos and Adobe Flash Games to post on the News Grounds websites - to then get home in the evening with the gang and use said website for nothing other than of course - to use the Celebrity Sound Boards - mainly Arnold Schartzenager - and - yeh - actually - pretty much any of them yeh - to make prank telephone calls to the local Chinese Takeaway - lolz - 

I go up in to my bedroom - and - on my 1990's Hi Fi - and start listening to the Randy Newman - Toy Story - Compact Disc - (whilst playing on my Tamagotchi obviously)  - and then for some reason - after I had as a kid decided to order the  original Compact Disc version of the Classical Pokemon era Sound Track - using that as the Theme to accompany some Trading Pokemon Cards Battles with the friends - after a bowl of Lucky Charms - and a bottle of the ORIGINAL Dr Pepper - maybe throwing in a little bit of Marsh Mallow Fluff in their - or - just - the entires jars - or Peanut Butter - or - just - the entire jars - ha - 

some Robin Williams, Jim Carey then required later - watching Jumanji and then buying the Jumanji Film Score Music Compositions on Compact Discs - and the same goes for - The Mask - 

at 15 - 16 going in to the local ""Satchmo's"" bar/theatre and pretty much hi-jacking the Grand Piano with some friends to play some Louis Armostrong renditions - or more like - trans-mogrifications - and then all getting free copies of Vinyl Louis Armtrong Discs and a Satchmo special Hot Chocolate Liquir (with Marsh Mallows on it?! - yeh boy)  to take home for our dues - because they knew our parents - slightly under the age parametres but who cares ey - 



comes a trip suddenly for the month to the local Theatre - to watch Martin Taylor jamming away with Steve Howe - some epic Acousitc Jazz Gutiar Medleys (pretty similar to Django Reindheart [also epic] to be quite honest) - 

go on to MSN (Micro Soft Network Messenger, that is - for any deprived Milleninals), ""all right man, Counter Strike 1.6?"", "" yeh kool, see you on it"" - 

in the mean time - using Basic to try and actually code a hack for the coding script in the Maps - and/or - to make Modfications for the servers - and/or - to basically - Pwn any N00bz who are utter Campers and Boom Head Shot them - in the - Office - Maps -  


In the mean time obviously, the siblings next door - listening to some James Brown and Michael Jackson one minute - and in the next hour - suddenly some - say what? - Blink 182, Sum 41, New Found Glory, and Fall Out Boy - HA - later turning in to - some - Emo Alert - only for Scene Kids just here - Under Oath - and/or - some - Funeral For A Friend - 

Later I am in my bedroom - on my 1990's Hi Fi - listening to the Sound Track to True Romance - Hanz Zimmer - You're So Cool - followed by some Thomas Newman,",0.9959,1441
