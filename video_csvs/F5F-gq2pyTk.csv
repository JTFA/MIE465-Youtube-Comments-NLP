"Thecooltransition 
Listen, shut the fuck up. You can clearly tell she loves it and is having fun. When she gets old enough and doesn’t like it, she will obviously stop. She won’t grow up to be like Logan and Jake Paul, they grew up to be assholes. She definitely is being taught to be grateful and happy in life.",0.9274,71
