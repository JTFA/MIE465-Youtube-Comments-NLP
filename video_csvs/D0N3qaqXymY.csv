"1. The receiver was on his way to the ground upon touching the ball, this makes him a rec not a runner. Therefore must maintain control throughout the catch.

2. His knee down means nothing as it is not due to contact from a defensive player. This means he is still in the process of catching the ball.

3. His action of reaching for the goal line is part of him going down not after a ""football"" move.

4. Upon reaching his elbow  (still not caused by a defensive player) hits the ground on, from here he still must maintain control of the catch throughout the play.

5. You can clearly see where his left hand comes off the ball, it starts to spin then the ball hits the ground and then regains control,  if the rec had complete control the ball would not have moved like this and it would of been a TD.

6. Once a ball touches the ground upon a pass play without complete control it is ruled incomplete per nfl rules, they applied the rule just like a receiver falling out of bounds needs to maintain control throughout the catch when they drag their feet or are pushed out after not making any steps or football move. 

Sadly, while people complain it was rigged the nfl stayed consistent with calling this just like the dez Bryant catch against GB. If dez isnt a catch then this isn't eaither.                                                  

RULE 8 SECTION 1 ARTICLES 3-4

Item 1. Player Going to the Ground. A player is considered to be going to the ground if he does not remain upright long enough to demonstrate that he is clearly a runner. If a player goes to the ground in the act of catching a pass (with or without contact by an opponent), he must maintain control of the ball until after his initial contact with the ground, whether in the field of play or the end zone. If he loses control of the ball, and the ball touches the ground before he regains control, the pass is incomplete. If he regains control prior to the ball touching the ground, the pass is complete.

Bottom line: It was an incomplete pass. The ball clearly touched the ground while the receiver did not have control of it.",0.522,428

"Almost no one's talking about the conclusive evidence rule, that supersedes the (terrible and inconsistently applied) catch rule - from the NFL rulebook, Rule 15, Section 2, Article 3: ""A decision will be reversed only when there is clear and obvious visual evidence available that warrants the change."" No one can honestly say there is ""clear and obvious"" evidence that James didn't maintain control, because his hand was under the ball when the tip hit the ground. Part of the ball is allowed to touch the ground if you have possession - and doesn't having a hand under the ball holding it with the other hand on the side gripping it indicate not losing control?!? Either way, the replays are definitely NOT clear, thus the call on the field should not have been overturned.",0.9675,154

"But what you describe has NOT been the definition of a catch in the NFL for 10 years now. At least for a catch while the receiver is in the process of falling or ""going to the ground."" When a receiver is falling while catching (which clearly he is), the rules absolutely 100% clearly state that the receiver must maintain control throughout the entire act of the fall. He is not completely on the ground yet when the ball is clearly rolling on the ground. Incomplete pass, clear as day. In the same way as if he caught it, made a football move, but only one foot was in bounds. Same concept. Pass is incomplete, all other moves, lines, etc. doesn't matter.",0.5631,143

"Did anybody here *actually* see the ball hit the ground, or did you merely see the ball move and *assume* that the movement was caused by contact with the ground?  That's the sticking point that nobody's talking about. If the ball didn't touch the ground, then it doesn't matter if it moved or not, it's still a catch and TD. So did it touch the ground, or not? Overturning the ruling on the field requires *indisputable video evidence* that the initial call was incorrect. I have yet to see that.

Half of u know nothing what ur talking about smh 🤦‍♂️,-0.3182,14
He actually caught the ball. He had control(two hands firmly on the ball) and two feet down before ball is bobbled. This is a touchdown because all he did was recover his fumble in the endzone and no touches him the whole time. This is like when a receiver catches the ball. Has two feet down and firm grasp on the ball and then gets cracked and ball comes loose. This would be ruled and incomplete pass. But... since he had the 2 rules of possession control and two feet down. It should be a fumble from a vicious hit not an incomplete pass. But if the hit from the defender was timed to where the receiver does not control or two feet yet and then the ball comes loose from a vicious hit. Then that is incomplete.,-0.7845,152

"He caught the ball and reached for the end zone.  They really need to get rid of this ""complete the catch"" crap.  Once the player has the ball and makes a move, he becomes a runner and he should operate under the same rules as a running back, he broke the plane, it's a touchdown.

Which the Patriots also benefited from against the Jets earlier in the year.",-0.7003,103
He clearly dropped the ball at the end. Had he got touched maybe because his knee was down but he was still in motion.,0.2144,26
He definitely  made a catch on one knee with clear possession of the ball. He even pulled the ball into his chest and had control of the football. The catch rule is no longer in play. He then gets to be like  a running back and lunges into end zone still in full control of the football and once it crossed the plane of the goal line it is and actually was called a touchdown.

Nothing about that call is wrong.",-0.802,69
He lost the ball on the way down,-0.3182,8
"Heres what you people fail to realize: 

You CANNOT OVERTURN a call unless there is CLEAR evidence that he didn't catch the football. If you cannot verify 100% that the catch was incomplete, by default, you have to (Key Word: HAVE TO) have the call stand. You can't say ""I think he didnt catch it"" and overturn it. That is incorrect. We don't know if he has fingers under it, we dont know if the ball ACTUALLY even hits the ground. The camera's cant show us that. Therefore, Referees SHOULD have had the call STAND due to not enough evidence being seen. 

The NFL catch rule didn't rob the Steelers, the Referees robbed the Steelers. Probably a Patriots fan, or wanted the Patriots to win. That's the only explanation because that was clearly favoritism by that Ref. Nobody knows if it was a catch or not.

NFL rules are purposely written like this full of holes to help cover the spread easier. Vegas money betting. Helllo!? Just like pass interfence. It can be a huge penalty yd as far as the qb can throw (most over 60 yd) which hands the team a td and the win. These may well be the best 2 examples of rules/penalties the nfl uses to cover the spread and win their money and Vegas wins theirs. NFL is listed as entertainment before sport and listed that way for a reason. So they cant be sued for rigging games if they get caught backed into a corner.

"So let me understand the logic that you simpletons are using. The game was rigged because the refs made a call that was consistent with the call that was made on the Dez Bryant play? And the NFL would rig a game for the Patriots after literally trying to destroy their golden child’s legacy just two years earlier? Seems super legit lmao. The fact that I have to defend the Patriots is stupid, but you guys sound way more salty than you do smart.",0.6199,92

They robbed them of 2 more plays to get in the end zone? Nope.,0.3167,16
They ruled this a catch on the field then overturned it but really there's no clear cut evidence the ball ever touched the ground.You can assume it touches the ground but his right hand remains on the ball in control of it blocking any view of it hitting the ground.. Horrible that they reversed this.....They call this incomplete but look at the 3rd qtr TD they gave Carolina against Green Bay last week. How in the hell is that a TD?? Byrd doesn't have complete possession till after he lands out of bounds!!! Terrible inconsistency in the NFL. This awful  rule will be changed within the next few years guaranteed.,-0.9742,121

This is a Catch, recovered fumble in the end zone and a Touchdown for the steelers.",-0.2714,76
"This is the Dez Bryant and Megatron catch all over again. At least they are consistent with the call.

"This is why I don't get too involved with football, too many people being nothing but arrogant, rude, obnoxious and disrespectful. So many football fan's behavior is like football is their life and when one thing goes wrong they berate others and behave as if their life just ended. It's a sport. Yes it's what gets the players paid, and that's good for them, and I understand the emotions of the PLAYERS when a game doesn't end in their favor, although I don't agree with fighting the other team because you're mad (I was in marching band, even though it's definately not football, we have the same emotions as football players) but, hello, fans aren't the ones being paid for watching the game, fans aren't the ones making the plays and risking career or life ending injuries. In the end, it's still just a football game. There's always the next, and there's always next year. I get that there are rivalries, but you seriously can't be respectful to anyone else? I'm not saying everyone is like this, but so many people are.

Watch the laces on the football in slow motion. They spin as soon as the ball hit the ground. showing that he didn't have control of it at the moment it his the ground but he quickly regained control like a quarter second later. Not a touchdown tho IMO.,0.5023,53

"Whether or not his knee or elbow touched or even if his hand was still underneath the ball you are all missing something.

Wrong rule and, in this case only, wrong call both on and then off the field.",-0.7506,75
While I hate the rule. A knee down does not make you a runner guys. All it does is say you made the first step in the process of making a complete catch. What people are ignoring is a knee down with the ball is only one half of it. Hitting the ground is considered part of the catch so if the ball hits the ground at any point and moves in the middle of that. It's incomplete. He's not a runner so crossing the plane is last on the list of the process.,-0.7506,101
Why haven't any sports network s shown this alongside the Ertz TD catch in the SB?,0.0,17
With the rb they make it like the classic game for super Nintendo pong. The ball touches even a mm past that white line/threshold its the same as ur ball passing the paddle before it got there in time. Even if by the smallest measurement you get pong or in our case TD. My comparison is to show that the goal line is a barrier like that in pong or blaster wild ball and 1 sec of control and 1 mm past that threshold of the end zone should be automatic td. Should be treated the same for rb and receivers. 1 sec of control anywhere in that end zone (2 feet down in certain cases) is TD. The survive the ground part only belongs outside of the end zones,0.8591,140

"i want too just run this by everyone again.  the rule of football.  first  a player maintains a catch once they pull the ball into the chest or holds the ball for at least 5 secs.,.   both were done by james.  first when he catches the ball he pulls the ball into his chest immediately. (which you can clearly see at one of the angles they show it from) then goes to one knee.  some people are saying hes down at the 1yrd line.  (no) because, he is untouched by the other team still.  which means,  he has the right to get back up and stretch or run which ever over the line. once he was untouched (as you can all clearly see) he then turns and stretches out over the line.  (TOUCHDOWN)  even with his knee down (TOUCHDOWN)  now he goes down and his left hand comes slightly off the ball.  which is 100% irrelevant because the ball already broke the goal line.  so his hand coming out from under the ball meant nothing at all.  he was still by that time still untouched.   for anyone who thinks this was not a catch your either a ne fan or you dont know football. or your just plain stupid.  this has been a rule since the beginning of football.  if a player is not touched he can get back up and run.  he can fumble the ball and recover his own ball laying on the ground and get back up and the sec that ball breaks the line the play is dead over touch down.  the steelers clearly got screwed.  and even though.  they kicked the living shit out of ne.  in the playoffs with a healthy antonio brown tom ladie and friends don't stand a chance in the dark.",0.644,338
