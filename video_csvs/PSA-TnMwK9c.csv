The Knicks would be a good destinatiin for him I mean he's from New York and they need a good PG,0.7003,21
"The New York Knicks would a perfect for Kemba (in my opinion). The fan base is solid and sound: not to mention they need an uptempo point guard (much respect to Jarred Jack). Having an uptempo guard, a do-it-all small forward, and a lights out center seems to be the direction that the NBA is headed. 
Porzingis and Hardaway (hoping he develops) are all ready there. They need a player like  Kemba Walker to go to the next level (guaranteed playoffs/top 3 or 4 for the 5 seasons).",0.9287,106

"The only looser here is going to be Dwight Howard, he was restarting finding his mojo, with a such a nice point-guard, who has fun and can laugh whether he makes a shot or loses it.  Chemistry is an issue. 

The Hornets should try to ship Kemba together with Dwight Howard - it is the best situation for him (they really don't want to handle him after Kemba has left) and a Kemba is a good chip to get someone to accept his contract.

The Knicks should try to do that: keep Porzingis and Tim Hardaway and make everyone else tradable, and bring in Kemba with Dwight Howard.

Now you can have Kemba spacing on pick and roll at the top of the key, while Porzingis will be aligned with Tim Hardaway on another side. Any other person who would not be traded on the roster, who is defense minded and an average shooter (good on non-contested shots) will do as the 5th player: with the spacing Porzings, Tim and Kemba provides, that lad would have sufficient time to shoot non-contested shots.

Just fantasying.",0.9477,205
