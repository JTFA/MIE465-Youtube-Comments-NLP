"For an almost 60k car that's disappointing. 
You can get autopark with cars costing 20-30k. When you hit 60k thats premium territory, model 3 is not premium and interior is beyond disappointing. Obviously the self drive features are a plus, but I just can't see why anyone would buy it. I get if it was under 45k for the top spec version, not 57.5k. 
UK base price is 35k, I'm assuming the version MKBHD drives would also be ¬£57.5k. 

Audi A7 Sportback starting price is ¬£55K. 

I'm a big fan of Tesla, 35k is certainly affordable but there's still a long way to go. If I could afford one, I'd go for the Model S (my favourite car without a doubt), Model X is also up there with my favs. Model 3 is just not appealing in any way, shape or form.",0.6187,167
