"Dearest people.. I don't know who you are and where you live, but my arms are open for you. Not only for you, but for everybody. Maybe I'm not near by you, but just think about this message and me. My arms are open. One day, a random person can see your pain in your eyes, while you hide your tears behind your beautiful smile. He or she will not ask you what is wrong with you, but will say: My arms are open.. <3",0.4118,99

"I would like to know your opinion on the Freedom Child album. I thought the album was ok, it was cool for them to try to experiment with a new style but I believe they didn't quite succeeded, they didn't fail either. They have some songs that are great, others that appear not so great but they grow on you over time (Rain was like that for me) and others that I probably won't be playing as often. I don't know I guess I was expecting something more of the album or maybe is that I was expecting something more familiar. I would like to point out that I'm not bashing the band as they are one of my favorite, just stating my opinion and I would like to see if other people feel the same way or is it just me.",0.9851,153
