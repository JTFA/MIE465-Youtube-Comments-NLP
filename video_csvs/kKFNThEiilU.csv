I'm positive that Roy Moore will win. Now, I'm not telling OTHERS what to do, but here was MY thinking when I began defending Moore. Others pointed to Democrats accused of sexual misconduct.

How does that exonerate Roy Moore? Others pointed to Hollywood and the news rooms of America.

How does that exonerate Roy Moore?
I'd never seen the piling on when it came to Roy Moore.

Before I began researching him, I thought it was strange that I'd never heard these allegations before. By using old articles in newspapers and magazines, I determined that over a forty year career of making powerful enemies, Moore had never once been accused of this behavior. From 2003 to 2005, Moore was a global celebrity whose fame was based on a moral code.

THAT would've been the time to destroy him with these accusations. Destroying Moore AT THAT TIME would've demolished the movement that saw him as one of its greatest exponents.

And yet...nothing.  None of the accusations against OTHERS meant anything to me.

All I cared about was, ""Is it possible that Roy Moore did these things?""  By researching Moore, I discovered that he's a man of stunning discipline and self-control.

He's been dealt VERY bad hands, both personally and politically.

Yet he always perseveres.

Roy Moore has lost more fights than he's won, but by FIGHTING, he shines light on issues.

THAT is his goal. He wants national debates on issues. REAL debates. In courtrooms and the houses of Congress.
Therefore Roy Moore will make a great senator. He's going to shake up the status quo.

I support him despite disagreeing with most of his social positions.

He's not a lunatic or a martyr. He fights in order to make people THINK.  The attempted destruction of Roy Moore shows that we need to rethink how such accusations are handled.

Why didn't a single journalist actually challenge the accusations?  Why are Roy Moore's ""allies"" to this day refusing to believe him?

I believe him. He's fighting back tooth and nail

If I'm wrong about Roy Moore, so what? All it means is that I believed someone but my belief was misplaced. But I believe Roy Moore because I researched his entire life.

I did so because I've NEVER SEEN such an incredible piling on and rush to destroy. It wasn't right, and somebody had to take the time to actually look at THE MAN. Roy Moore's record speaks for itself. HE convinced ME that he's innocent, and he didn't even have to say a word to me. When this comes up again, look at the ACCUSED. If there's no actual evidence, research the ACCUSED. Roy Moore's record is out there in plain sight. It's the record of a man who never once in forty turbulent years was accused of these things. That's why I believe that this was a coordinated political hit job.

The spin you’re putting on it is a too simple, don’t you think?

Since when do the words ‘rumors’ and ‘victims’ belong in the same sentence?

innocent until proven guilty

right to a fair trial

due process

Do those phrases mean anything to you? 

Also, let me ask you this...even if the Republicans didn’t like Moore and wanted him out, then why would they publicize these stories themselves? Wouldn’t they just quietly threaten him that they would release the stories unless he dropped out? If he refused to drop out then I could see them going public with these stories, whether true or false, but otherwise your logic makes no sense. There’s no point in making public something that puts the words ‘republican’ and ‘pedophile’ in the same headline. Not unless it was a Break Glass In Case Of Emergency type situation.
