I'm pretty the development time and the size of the team who developed this LABO thing was waaaaay smaller than the Zelda team, so how can they ask more than 60 dollars for this? I could see this being 60 dollars. Maybe 40 for the software and then 20 for the cardboard. And even then it would something overpriced.",0.8079,128

That would defeat one of the main strengths of Labo - no plastics peripherals to gather dust in some storage place and clutter the garbage bins. Cardboard is a lot friendlier to kids and DIY crafts over plastic that can have sharp edges along the cut lines and dusts and chips that can hurt them and have the flexibility that plastic does not have (try making use of plastics in DIY and one of the essential equipment is a heat source to soften the plastic for shaping).,-0.3818,91

And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.‚Äù
