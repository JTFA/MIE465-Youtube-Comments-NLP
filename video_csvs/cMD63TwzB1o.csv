"OK SO, I can also see this being about sza and only one SZA. The weekend. The beginning is the wait for the weekend? In the black on the balcony, dancing so longingly. The next outfit in the parking lot? The weekend? High energy. Happy shes still with this man, even though it hurts. Shes doing this over and over, hence the repetition at times. On a checkerboard. Maybe shes playing a game? Not taking it seriously? Its the WEEKEND damnit! Im so happy she could be saying. But when the weekend ends. Or maybe while shes trying so hard dancing,(also peep, usually at the timing the weekend comes up chorus, shes on that damn checkerboard in the outfit) she remembers that ultimately, she doesnt have a real man. Shes just a pit stop JUST A GAME. And she wears the checkerboard just seconds after being on top of it. Now in the next scene, SZA wears this red outfit, and shes dancing like she mad asf. And at this part of the song, She questions her needs/wants, after the weekend most likely. She wants more days with this person. She wants a little bit more. But again ultimately shes still alone. Eventually we come back to the black SZA and shes back on the balcony hanging over it. It must be a weekday again or something. One opted out phrase pops up in the last scenes. Shes tired of the cycle, broke it? And became this magical sparkly person? Just my interpretation. I love the video. It really makes you think, and I love the fact she didnt just give us all what we wanted, NOW this most definitely looks like Cranes in the parking lot , but it definitely has meaning to it. I think this was done right. Shes not expressing overtly how she is a side hoe.

I feel like she had someone. Who has someone else. But she wants him so bad that she takes what hes giving. Each part of this video is a representation of her loneliness. Shes alone. Shes alone waiting for the weekend. Shes alone in reality ON the weekend. And shes alone after the weekend. The only way to be alone and not hopeless. Was to opt out.",-0.679,441

dumbest video I ever seen,-0.5106,5
"everyone in the comments like “i don’t get the video!”, let me explain from my perspective.




the whole entire song is about her (SZA) being a side chick. the lyrics after the first chorus are “i gotta say i’m in the mood for a little bit more of that, i mean i’m saying what kinda deal is two days? i need me at least ‘bout four of them, more of them, more you, on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah”

she misses “her” man, but since she cant interfere with his main relationship, she can’t do anything about it. she feels seductive, but again, can’t do anything. therefore, she’s dancing around in lingerie in isolation. she wants to “satisfy” him, but can’t, and is feeling alone. hence, the video.",-0.63,183
