((   ‚úù  )) like totally love this song that Sugarland did. Truly is fantastic I will say that so is the music video to. In a way I am glad that Jennifer Nettles went back to Sugarland. however I think she should had stayed by herself and doing her solo albums. I'm just being very open and honest and given my opinion. The other band mates in Sugarland are totally cool and fantastic don't get me wrong. I just think Jennifer has been so much better on her own as a solo artist. Don't get me wrong I love sugarland's music. they are really fantastic I went to see them four times in concert already. Definitely got to say a fantastic show that was. The other thing is I tried to Google Sugarland. To see when their new cd comes out + also to see what is the name of the cd as well. However nothing came up yet. And the other thing is this I also been watching cmt off and on to see if sugarlands new music video is on there still the same so far I haven't seen it on cmt yet. But anyway just want to say gratulations Sugarland on getting back together. Cannot wait until your new CD comes out also once again I love and I enjoy your new song and music video for still the same. Also hopefully I could see Sugarland again in concert and also hopefully you guys come to the Sands in Bethlehem Pennsylvania.,0.9962,273

"1.  Two things that are still the same:  She's still gorgeous, and she still has the chops.  (And damn, what chops.)
2.  This woman is 43 years old folks - let that sink in.  Talk about well-preserved - she must bathe in formaldehyde.
3.  Her hair has NEVER looked bad...ever.  No matter how she fixes or cuts it, it always looks sexy and gorgeous.
4.  Now on to this tune - it's mildly pleasant, but nothing to write home about.  The hook line is just barely hanging on.
5.  How to make a bazillion dollars in show bidniss:  Start a group, have a great attitude, and get real lucky (See: him).",0.9403,140

Sugarland still sounds great it's like they had never broke up that's how good sugarland is. Supposably I was told that SugarLand has a new cd coming out. Here's the sad thing about that. Nobody knows for sure when sugarland's new CDs coming out. I am hoping it comes out in Spring. Also the other thing I'm surprised that TMC does not play this music video by Sugarland that all. The other thing is supposedly Sugarland is coming to the Allentown Fairgrounds in the fall. Not too far from where I live. I am hoping the tickets aren't that expensive cuz I want to see Sugar Land. I know sometimes the tickets can be a fortune and other times they are affordable. I'm just glad Sugarland his back that's all.,0.98,162
