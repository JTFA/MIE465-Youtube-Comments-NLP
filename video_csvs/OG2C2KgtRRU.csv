"I found your videos when looking how to fix a zipper stuck in dress lining, and found a lot more. Our family is learning how a zipper factory works, and it's fascinating! Thanks for the videos. If you could add a video about my problem, I'd really appreciate it. So far the lining's ripped and won't come out, and I'm going to try using what other sites suggest before removing the slider like Hyram shows.",0.8169,84
"Sadly I was unable to find out who uses your zippers. I prefer my dollars to support American companies and would prefer to purchase locally made items with locally sourced base components. Can you provide a list of some of your largest customers so we can support them, who in turn would support you?  Thanks!",0.8172,60
