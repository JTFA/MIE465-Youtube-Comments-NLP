"Hi Marques, could you please do a review on the new energizer smartphone... might need some more insight into the said phone",0.6597,24
"Hi Marques, lots of love from the hot West Indies.  I really like your videos.  You don't go over the top/try too hard or seem fake.  I especially like that you really try to give thoughtful and rounded reviews as opposed to just sounding like an out and out ""fanboy"".   In addition, you always look well groomed and that counts for something! In your quest to improve - which is pleasing to see and hear, just remember: stay true to what's got you this far.  Let your professionalism and honesty drive you.  Continue to give thoughtful and meaningful reviews - which is why we're all here.  Try to keep your feet firmly grounded so your ego and your dignity stay in check.  Don't go after views cause that's when the wheels will start to come off.  Don't let making money overtake you and lead you to become self-absorbed and assine.  It's the thing that has separated you from being like most of the run-of-the-mill YouTubers who are just outright immature, tasteless, melodramatic and trashy, and it's what makes your work refreshing and positive.   It's okay to enjoy the fruits of your labour but remember to STAY HUMBLE & STAY CLASSY!

May this be your best year yet!",0.9874,232
