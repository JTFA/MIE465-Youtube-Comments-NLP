"""Cabrona""

Change has got me feeling new
 Changing my intention for attention from you
 I said I faded, faded like the days
 Losing my attempt to draw a picture of you

 So I get up, get down
 Get up, get down
 Get up, get down
 Get up, get down

 Bad girl taking back the lead
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Got no room to please
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Leave you just to see how long, how long
 How long will it take you to show you need a girl like me
 Show you need a girl like me

 Jaded, jaded with the weight
 Hung up on a yesterday not going my way
 But I made it, I made it out alive
 The only question now is what direction to choose

 So I beat up, beat down
 Beat up, beat down
 Beat up, beat down
 Beat up, beat down

 Bad girl taking back the lead
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Got no room to please
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Leave you just to see how long, how long
 How long will it take you to show you need a girl like me
 Show you need a girl like me

 Feet don't fail me now
 I'm a different lady
 Feet don't fail me now
 I'm a different lady
 Feet don't fail me now
 I'm a different lady
 Feet don't fail me now
 I'm a different lady

 Bad girl taking back the lead
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Got no room to please
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Leave you just to see how long, how long
 How long will it take

 Bad girl taking back the lead
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Got no room to please
 Yeah I'm a bad girl
 Leave you just to see how long, how long
 How long will it take you
 Bad girl

"Lyrics:
Verse 1-
Changes got me feeling new

Changing my intention for attention from you

I said faded

Faded like the days

Losing my attempt to draw a picture of you.
So I get up, get down, get up,get down

Get up, get down, get up get out

Chorus:
Bad girl
Taking back the needy(?)
I'm a bad girl
Got no room to please you
I'm a bad girl
Leave you just to see
How long, how long,
How long will it take you to show you need a girl like me
Show you need a girl like me.

Verse 2:
Jaded, jaded with the wait
Hung up on a yesterday not going my way

Boy, I made it, made it out alive,

Only question now is what direction to choose. 

So I beat up, beat down, beat up, beat down.

Beat up, beat down, beat up beat down.

(Chorus.)

Feet don't fail me now, I'm a different lady (x4)
