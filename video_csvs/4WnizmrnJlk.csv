I get such a kick out of just how tormented miserable  liberal snowflakes like Seth Meyers are at this presidency. It reminds me a little bit of Ronald Reagans first years. Back then the liberals went ape sh%t and said many similar things. Its going to be a long seven years for this clown and what will make him more miserable each and every day is knowing he can't do anything about it. The democrats have no response to Trump's agenda. Obamacare is a mess. We really do need immigration reform and secure borders. The Tax Code does need revamping (hasn't happened since 1986). We do need to become energy independent and a strong economy raises all boats. If Trump makes progress on the economic front and addresses these other issues it will be very difficult to run against him if your only solution is to mock and condemn him because you cannot stand his personality.  The progressive left are little more than socialists and communists that want government and elites to run our lives. Their poster child is out of office and as James Carville once said on why Clinton won a second term......it's the economy stupid. People vote their wallets and the fact that the MSM is so blatantly unfair to this president means his base will be very secure because he is taking on the propagandists. Good luck Seth....enjoy the misery of every day and your hate that you love to spew.....its all coming back to you.....,-0.376,274

The parallel here is how somebody cant just use their gender as a way to wiggle their way into office.

I shouldn't have to explain this but I feel obligated to. Political candidates are chosen based on their policies and ideologies that appeal to the largest crowd, thats how a democratically elected system works. Yet your pre-recorded crowd chanting ""woo"" at the fact that a woman is running for a seat just because she is a woman rather than a man seems to agree with the contrary. 

What does Dana Nessel do? Shes a woman? But what does she do.... we're done here? Ok. I guess when you have so many children who grow up still believing in the philosophy of democracy based on hair color, you have to appeal to them so you don't get bullied at the lunch table behind the scenes.",0.9191,195

But I'm going to stop saying it now JUST BECAUSE THAT ORANGE IDIOT TRUMP WANTS IT SAID.  From now on, it's only going to be Happy Holidays. The guy raped and sodomized and beat a 13 year old girl at one of Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile parties, and he has been known to creep on young women - the younger the better - for 30 years. Much like Moore, he has had a reputation for being a stalker of young girls for DECADES, but the people who claim to be conservatives don't care about that. Apparently it's fine for young girls to be raped or molested in their book. If Moore is elected, I think that ""Alabama is for Pedophiles"" should be the new graffiti slogan down there.  And when the inevitable waves of old perverts start kidnapping young girls, we will know who to blame.... every jerk who voted for Old Roy.  Just like the waves of racists crawled out from under their rocks to scream all loud and proud after Don the Con was elected, Moore is going to be an impetuous for the pedophiles to think that society is okay with their crimes, too. Don the Con was the poster boy for the KKK, but Moore is the Pedophile Poster Boy, and it's going to lead to young women being kidnapped, raped, sodomized, molested, and probably murdered in record numbers. And it will be in part the fault of every person who votes for him, just like our current huge mess is the fault of all those who voted for Don the Con.",-0.9909,329

If he used this sinister button to close the doors and they locked, all you'd have to do is unlock the door and open it.

This is just sensationalism.  I don't know why people can't just report the story without trying to find the most sinister angle.  It makes sense that a journalist might want a secluded office so he'd have privacy on his phone calls and with his guests.  It makes sense that if his phone rings and it's a confidential source or a conversation that needs to remain private, he'd have a button that closes his door.",-0.9646,168

"Let's put things in perspective.  This is not meant to defend sexual harassment, but to get people to think about the demonization taking place.  I am seeing words like ""monster"" and ""creepy"" used to describe men guilty of sexual harassment.  They are being portrayed as the very worst sort of people.  I do not condone such behavior, but ask the reader to think about what constitutes truly bad behavior.  There are men who beat up their wives or girlfriends, giving them bloody noses and knocking out teeth.  To me, a man who beats up a woman (actually, anybody who beats up another person) is far worse than a person guilty of sexual harassment.  There are people who commit violent physical assaults, armed robbery, people who break into homes, etc.  ""Monster"" seems much more appropriate for describing these truly serious crimes.  

If you've ever been extremely rude to another person, you're not all that different from somebody who is guilty of sexual harassment.  Do you feel you would deserve to be publicly shamed in the national media because you were extremely rude to a co-worker?

It is interesting that all these cases of sexual harassment came out all at once, over a period of about a month, starting with the Weinstein case.  Did sexual harassment suddenly become far more common recently?  Of course not.  This has been a deliberate campaign to focus public attention on the topic of sexual harassment, by broadcasting every single allegation of sexual harassment against famous celebrities, all at once.  So it seems like the media has been rather biased in choosing which stories to report on.  I'm sure there have been just as many violent crimes to report, as ever; but the media has adopted the agenda of trying to program the attitudes of the general public, by serving up a high dose of sexual harassment cases all at once.  

It is good to draw attention to sexual harassment.  But I do have a problem with portraying these men as ""monsters"", that deserve nothing but scorn.  Their behavior was wrong, but they are not like men who beat up women, or men who commit violent sexual assaults [as far as I know; I haven't read the details of most of these cases, actually].",-0.9985,430
