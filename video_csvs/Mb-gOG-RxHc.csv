AgarTron you act like the only thing to happen in thirty years is tax cuts. Also I believe that their are times when we need high taxes and others when we need low taxes. The gov got to learn when that is and actually be able to implement it correctly. Also why is it the job of the upper class to support the middle class? Shouldn’t the middle class be able to support itself? If not than they are living on a false economy will soon fall regardless of tax rates.,0.6072,99
AgarTron you want to back that up with some proof? It’s not like they cut the upper class taxes and raise taxes on the middle class. They cut everybody taxes. They also did not dramatically cut domestic programs that hurt the middle class. Also who said it was okay to hurt the upper class to help the middle class?

"To truly show the world what they want you have to show them what they need and wait for them to want what they need. A change of perspective can ignite the passions of the mind and heart. All things are not created equal, nor are all men. We are a spectrum of lives as complex and unique as anything else in this world. Unlike nature we have the ability to choose, to understand the effect of our choices, and act upon the information in future situations. We also have the abundance of knowledge of generations before,  we have analyzed ourselves throughout history.  Now we have an ability to take everything and analyze it to the point of putting a face on reality.  We choose not to see the true face of humanity because it would be like seeing the Face of God, and to see that which our hearts cannot bear to witness we fear that we would burn in the light. We look out in space for life and destroy the life right here in greater numbers than the first million planets that surround us. We wish to see sentient life and yet are divided ourselves by race. Religion defined by minds that are too limited to conceptuaize the mind of another human being and yet believe they know the mind and will of God. Humanity has so much wasted potential if the people who actually understand the world would stop trying to rule it but guide it for the betterment of all, show the world the path and have them help to build it. We don't need a leader, we need leaders of all races and creeds to stand up in the name of humanity, to help raise others, to allow the growth potential of humanity to truly be defined by mankind.  The information the average person can find in a newspaper is more than most people ever had in a lifetime only a few hundred years ago.  Information isn't the problem,  we are bombarded by information every day,  but the information drives the economy, politics, public opinion, and the ways that the average person can do in their communities is lacking significantly. Help people make the world around them better by opening up opportunities for them to participate in making changes towards a better humanity.",0.9894,419

the sun was actually cooler during the time of dinosaurs. The reason for warmer conditions on the planet during their hundreds of millions of years of existence was the fact that there was no polar ice caps when they were here. There was no land masses at the poles when dinosaurs lived. Google images of what the Earth looked liked when dinos did exist. Remember the super continent Pangia? No land at the poles means no land to support polar ice caps. No ice caps mean much more radiation bombards the planet. Mammals existed during dino time but were forced to live under ground and only foraged at night. It took the ice ages to create conditions ideal for mammals.,0.6187,129

william louie I’m a Democrat but Rand Paul actually answered that question in an interview when the host confronted him about his vote. He said that he believed that money is more wisely spent by the people than it is by the government. A tax cut has the small chance of boosting our economy while a budget deficit definitely does not. He voted for the tax cut with the belief that a Republican Congress would try to cut money from the budget being that they’re conservative. A little naive but good intentions.,0.4279,101
