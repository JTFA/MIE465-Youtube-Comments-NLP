"Aside from needing to be compassionate with others and not overdramatizing our problems... Lesson #1: Sleep early.. wake up early.. make it a daily ritual.. have your coffee or whatever at home in peace.. start off your day relaxed and positive.. Lesson #2: Be careful with women. Choose your partner wisely. Well.. Western women nowadays are privileged. Personally, I‚Äôm shocked to see how horribly many women treat genuine men these days. Men HAVE FEELINGS TOO! They can be HEARTBROKEN TOO! Men can have the softest and most delicate hearts. Fidelity, divorce, rejection, etc. can tear a man‚Äôs world apart. Women, treat men as you wish to be treated and stop always acting as the victim and taking advantage of the once dark history of women :) 
I‚Äôm a girl by the way. And I know that women are still oppressed in many countries and all that. I‚Äôm talking about women in developed and ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù countries.",0.6421,193

"First of all, as you can guess, I am not perfect in English. I appolpgize in advance for any mistakes. Secondly, this is one of the worst videos about social workers Ive seen in my life. Not only you show us in bad light but also the purpose of social work. This guy here is a classical frustrated, arrogant, heartless clerk who exercise his power over the needy ones. You clearly know nothing about social work realities. I mean, we are already under heavy pressure, being criticized every day for incompetence. But also thanks to social workers there are many people who got back into the society. People who got sober, people who got employed, families reunited, domestic violence prevented. Media tell nothing about that, they do not care. I mean, social workers are also humans and to be clear - we are no superhumans. But our job is superhuman. I have a lot of respect to everyone who decide to graduate in social work and enter the field because I know how frustrating it can be. Low salaries, stress, working over time, bureacracy. Videos like that will only undermine social work value and discourage young people to study it. Btw work demand for social workers is incredible high. Thanks for attention.",-0.9902,244

"I am from Poland, English is not my mother tongue although I will try my best. I appologize in advance for any grammar and other mistakes. I am a social worker. This video pissed me off and I am gonna defend my field. This video shows us, social workers, as frustrated jerks who exercise power on fragile needy clients. Furthermore it suggests that social workers are the ones that need fix. Common belief is that when you enter social field and want to help people you are just trying to help/cure yourself. Thats why psychologists and therapists are thought to be the most troubled people. Same goes with social workers. I would like to clarify that. We are just humans with their flaws and sins. We have the same problems as our clients. But we support the needy in order to empower them. Its our job and we shoud stay professional and ethical about it. Ethics and integrity are crucial values in this job. Without it you will end up as another lifeless, heartless clerk. Bureacracy is another serious problem in social work. Tons of papers need to be done everyday. Where there is time to spend quality time with your clients? When? It is always easy to criticize something when you are an outsider, not engaged. Social workers are in the media, whenever they make a mistake but they are never shown when they prevent domestic violence, help unemployed to find a job, assist disabled person. Its a long topic, I could go for hours but I am not here to complain. I am here to speak the truth how it is so go on ask my questions. Thanks for attention.",-0.1582,318

"I can absolutely relate to this short film.¬† My job title is not¬†'Social Worker', but as a family counselor, it is essentially very similar.¬† I will say that the cold disconnect that the social worker character in this film seems to display seems more than a bit¬†of an exaggeration of reality (he says things to the homeless character that I nor the majority of my colleagues would ever say to our clients even on the worst of days).¬† Yet I understand that for the sake of a short story, exaggeration was necessary to provide a contrast between characters quickly.¬† What the homeless character experienced and described... unfortunately that is only a scratch on the surface of some of the stories and events I often hear about from the families I work with.¬† Overall, this was well done, poignant, and true to life.¬† Most people are quick to assume the worst about people without knowing anything about their life.",-0.8765,178

"Puts things into perspective, doesn‚Äôt it?   When I was young, in my mid-teens, I had very low self esteem because I didn‚Äôt like myself and I felt ugly.  So, I thought it would be helpful to see a counselor.  And, it was VERY helpful because when I walked into the counselor‚Äôs office, feeling ugly, I took one look at her and realized that maybe I wasn‚Äôt the most beautiful girl in the world, but I sure wasn‚Äôt ugly... I felt that the COUNSELOR WAS UGLY!  It was a wonderful eye opener for me.  It was then that I realized how meaningless our appearance is.  This counselor was short and fat with wiry hair, yet she glowed with kindness... she grew more attractive as I spoke with this kind person.  I‚Äôve never complained about being ugly again.  Our actions and behaviors shape how others see us.  Now that I‚Äôm old with a hunched back, droopy eyes, and saggy skin, I am neither beautiful nor ugly. I am simply happy.",0.9404,207

"You see the acting of the social worker and it's that ex-millennial, post Hangover, The Office essence of style.  Then you meet the homeless man and whenever he is asked a question, he gives this glazed over, outer body blank stare and think, ""Deadpanning the snot out of mental illness and substance abuse.""

Then he begins to talk and the story is complimented well by his emotion and soft, subtle complexity of the tension between each event - losing a sister, memoralizing her with another friend using the illness of substance abuse, walking past his ex-wife and daughter and the tension that created expressed through his countenance reaction -  you can see how much it hurt him to see them, to be recognized by his ex-wife and the 15 years between them.  Then he gets acted and you can understand the shamefulness of his attackers, the humiliation he suffered and his innocence, helplessness and sadness felt when he says, he didnt do nothing or say anything to them. The loneliness and sadness that we know we felt when he first heard of his friend dying throughout the encounter with his ex-wife and kid has been revisited in this explanation of this beat down and professing his innocence. All of this culminating in apologizing for the ""smell""; the damage done by these events and his illness, now brought to bare when he confesses why he came to the facility, ...""don't think I will make it.""

This is tremendous acting.  And it catapults you into orbit when you discover that the two men in this story are one and the same.  

The same man performing both roles superbly, is the very same director.
