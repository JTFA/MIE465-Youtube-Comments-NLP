"(This is a rant) I'm absolutely sick of companies like buzzfeed, picking out the new ""trends"". As a makeup artist I like to experiment and be creative with my looks and I know many beauty guru's on insta like do that to. But as soon as they do something creative and different it's then considered a ""trend"" when it's not! People enjoy doing beauty creatively and it shouldn't be then publicly outcasted for its differentness. It's like the feather eyebrows and Christmas tree eyebrows, the person doing them wasn't trying to be a trend setter but doing it for their own enjoyment. Rant over. This video was really funny and really reflective of whacy 2017.",0.9495,130
