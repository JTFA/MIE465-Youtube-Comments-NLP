Anything but something public. In addition to that, if she was truly mature and confused to as to why KC wants nothing to do with her, why the continuous interviews of answering questions about it? Why all the ""I'm innocent and confused, why is Kim saying these things?"" She should of declined to even speak of her if she truly knows KC had a huge problem with her, but instead takes on EVERY question about the topic.
