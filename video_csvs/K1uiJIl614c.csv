All you did was write words about something that doesnt apply to you. So yeah it was a string of pointless words. Kind of like your original post.

I stated from the beginning that I had no dog in the fight, that does not however forebode me from having an opinion. I made that very obvious in my comments.

So don't let the devil, or anyone, scare you from approaching Jesus today. 

He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him (John 6:37, paraphrased)

So come to Him today. Call upon His Holy Name and He will save you. 

He will forgive you, wash you and make you new. He will also deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth.

Everyone should talk about politics because silence and/or apathy regarding politics helps no one and allows corruption to spread throughout an ignorant populace.",-0.7882,97
