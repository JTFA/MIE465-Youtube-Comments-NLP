"...and I got my disk today... should I keep it in the wrapper?
...then when she looked over I was gone... Is it here or am I it too?
... in the carpet or was it grass? every thing is wrong...
... when I wrote wrong right or write then and there was nothing and...
carpet.  ...but it was over and he came out... Keep it in the wrapper for ever?
it loves. What loves? My Universe. Well then it lives then. Really? Wow.
Is your garden in love? is love in your garden?
love it. love what? Love Earth. why? She is your sister. Oh.
Love it. Love what? Sol. Why? He's your brother. Really? Yup.
then it is alive then? Yup ""it"" is all alive and you are it...
...then she was walking and smiling when all the sudden... Or should I open it?
Parts of nothing are in between everything else... Missing you missing me? 

... she never saw it, loved it, touched it... it was in the beginning with her.
...he saw her with it; in her; with her; they were everything together...
Union... you in... u in verse... prose


...stand facing yourself across the room... Gray, smooth room empty and full of you...
Open your eye and see yourself cry...
It was there with you. ...nothing was simple in the beginning.
Born of one Breath his beat began to turn... Storm on into the room with her heart.
Listen? Yes. Why? She is your answer... 
thanks Bjork for asking good questions then.

"Bjork will always be Bjork. ¬†There's no questioning that. ¬†But, as serious long-time fans like myself, let's really look at this latest work through a critical lens. ¬†She honestly has stopped progressing in her musical style. ¬†It's almost as if letting ProTools go crazy on her computer spits out another atmospheric, minimalist record! ¬†I could play Utopia, Biophilia and Vulnicura back to back and they all sound the same. ¬†I long for the days when Bjork wasn't afraid to try new musical styles and truly push the envelope. ¬†Debut was iconic progressive house, ¬†Homogenic was mind-bending. ¬†Medulla was risky yet set a new benchmark for instrumentalization with the human voice. ¬†Volta set the record straight that Bjork could do hip hop HER way. ¬†But, Utopia and Vulnicura could easily be seen as more Arca records. ¬†Even in videos. ¬†What would be rebellious for her - try storytelling narrative, use a different lens to establish a mood, incorporate a cast of actors to convey the meaning of the song, etc. etc.. ¬†The green screen is so outdated and lazy. ¬†It's almost as if she's making music and videos for herself and not her fans. ¬†Why should this matter? ¬†Because if she is out to move the world with her art it must be ART in the first place that pushes the boundaries. ¬†True, if I don't like it I don't have to listen to it. But, as fans let's all be honest- the emperor has not clothes!",0.846,278

"H√° 20 anos eu simplesmente amo esta mulher. Acompanho cada fase dela desde ent√£o. Sua obra at√© ent√£o me √© incorrupt√≠vel, de manera que disfruto cada m√∫sica e cada v√≠deo clip, eu a sinto em suas can√ß√µes (em vulnicura tanto que eu queria ir l√° dar um abra√ßo e dizer que tudo ia acabar bem), mas neste novo trabalho ainda n√£o consigo identificar a Bjork, n√£o consigo identificar-me com as can√ß√µes deste √°lbum - que j√° escutei algumas vezes. S√£o espet√°culos visuais, sem d√∫vida, mas falta algo. A vibe vespertine de ""blissing me"" me deixou content√≠ssimo, mas fiquei na ilus√£o. N√£o sei ainda que tipo de desconstru√ß√£o ela prop√µe com esta obra que sim, eu sei, √© genial. Que me dizem vcs outros f√£s da diva n√≥rdica???",0.5171,149

"I don't really get self-love from this song - more codependency than anything. She does literally say she's being needy... Can't relate. Still, it's a lovely song.",0.5859,32
"I dont think ""success"" is something she worries about. It's art, being successful or not is really not the point, it transcends this definition you're trying to reach. You just have to feel the music, feel her, feel what she wants to express, i think this is the whole point of her music. Of course i would like to see more people enjoying her art as much as i do, but not everyone has the sensibility or patience her art demands, and i dont mean to sound pretentious, but from my point of view, a lot of people just are too immediatist, they want fast, cheap, easy and disposable music, and bjork antagonizes all of that, her music is difficult, often dull and hard to get into, but in my opinion, this difficulty is what makes her music such an epiphany when you finally get it.",-0.5908,169
"I dunno, all this time in her career her music/vids are her vision and what she wants to experiment with. I don't know how Biophilia and Vulnicura and Utopia sound the same to you? Each album is so different haha. It's like saying all classical music sounds the same.",0.7769,56
