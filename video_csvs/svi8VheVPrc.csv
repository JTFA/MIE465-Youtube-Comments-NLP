"Ah, so wireless charging was all the rage when iPhones didn‚Äôt have it, but now iPhone has it and the Pixel doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs suddenly not a big deal?

And if you already own a Macbook that‚Äôs charged via USB-C, you‚Äôre flat out lying if you say the Pixel is the better fit. 

That same Macbook and its charger also negate the ‚Äúyou have to buy a separate fast charger‚Äù-argument. 

Lastly, while I agree the stills of the Pixel 2 are slightly better thanks to Google‚Äôs vastly superior image processing; the iPhone X is miles ahead in terms of video. Not only does it do 4K 60fps, but you can actually listen to the recorded audio without your ears starting to bleed. 

The Pixel 2 XL is a great phone, and I‚Äôm seriously trying to convince my brother to get one, knowing it‚Äôs the perfect phone for him. But the iPhone X is the better all rounder",0.9852,191

"Apple didn't have to get rid of the Home button. They could of reinvented it by using Samsung's idea of a underneath the screen button. *shrugs shoulders* Overall I didn't choose either of these phone's due to the lack of a headphone jack. If you pair the headphone jack with a DAC, like the LG V30, you can get superior audio quality and still have Bluetooth 5.0, but I would say the Pixel 2's dual stereo front facing speakers were inciting.

I always have both Android and iOS, but my iPhone tends to be my daily driver. So I can accept a few concessions, like a weaker camera, in the Android handset.

"That voice assistant query on The Post goes both ways. With Siri, it's making you aware that there's multiple movie's with ""The Post"" in the title.

What if you were looking for one of the alternate ""the post"" movies? Also remember that Google Assistant has not associated your account with interest in that movie. Apple doesn't care and hasn't breached your privacy.",0.0956,111

"You can check the time on an X that is resting on a surface by tapping the screen twice.

Aside from that, this is a great comparison. I would however argue that the Pixel 2 XL has a litany of bugs. The headphone adapter for USB-C has numerous problems from sound cutting out to odd loud noises that make wired listening unbearable. It is the main reason I returned the phone after using 2 Google adapters. I am not alone in this. There are also Bluetooth connectivity issues. The screen takes getting used to, but it was still sub-par considering the panels on the X, S8, Note 8 and LCD options on the Xperia XZ Premium or the HTC U11. Google Now has taken a bullet to the head as the focus shifts towards Assistant, so that experience is  disjointed. The camera is outstanding, but it is extremely comparable to other flagships. And the biggest issue is ecosystem. Chrome OS and Android still feel separate and Android Wear is a dumpster fire. 

I will see what Google has to offer in their 3rd Pixel lineup and see if they create a more reliable and cohesive ecosystem. For now, I would stick with Apple or use Samsung flagships with Gear smart watches and a PC as your productivity device since integration has vastly improved between Android and Windows. This is just my opinion. Different strokes for different folks.",0.8545,260
