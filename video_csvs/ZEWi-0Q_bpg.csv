"@artix: more touches will not necessarily build rhythm. If that were the case the Hawks wouldn't have performed so badly against the Cavs in the playoffs and millsap and horford wouldn't have left. Flow is not a product of ball movement: When Lebron was point guard he was mostly standing in one spot and nailing dudes with 10+ assists and that was the greatest compatibility their offense ever had (also was a defensive boon because he mostly at the top of the 3 point line, so during turnovers he could anchor the defense with his threat as a shot blocker in the paint). Ball movement without the right coach and personalities is actually dysfunctional, and neither Lue nor the players around Lebron have the mind that kind of play.",-0.174,140

In Bosh's case it was because he was overrated af and had no reliable low post skill.

"And lastly, it really shocks me how selective the memory of the average NBA fan is. Last year, before injuries hit the Cavs, Kyrie was consistently dropping double-assist games because Lebron was changing his style into one incorporating spot-up shooting (similar to how he's becoming a serious pick and roll threat with Thomas, whereas he never really set serious screens on the past, only using them get switches for the ball handler etc mostly, not did he ever really commit to the roll for offense). Which means that Lebron is willing and able to adapt whatever style of play is most effective.

Assists are completely dependent on your teammate making his shot.  You do understand that if his teammates hit those shots they aren't in the position that they are in now.  An assist is the most unselfish stat in sports because everyone else gets the points.  If there is a stat to pad that is the most unselfish one.  If he was jacking up 40 shots a game instead of setting up his teammates then you would have a point,0.0,83

"Charles Hamilton Not all assists are created equally. Controlling the tempo is only beneficial to LeBron and it won't get everyone else involved because they're not touching the ball. The Warriors thrive on ball movement and hockey assists and everyone else getting the ball. Imagine if KD and Curry come down every possession, holding the ball until they find someone wide open. That would mess up the offensive flow of the Warriors system. There's a thing called the hockey assist and it's passing to someone who passes to the player who ultimately makes the shot. That's an effective way to get everyone going and it keeps the ball movements sharp. Holding the ball is not a good strategy in today's NBA. The Cavaliers has a roster of very capable shooters. LeBron needs to learn to pass even if the pass won't turn into an assists.",0.4565,156

"First off, look at Kyrie's improved efficient with Lebron. Didn't shoot over 40% from 3 until Lebron came for example. Was also far better in terms of assists than even this year, and before the recent stretch against booty teams his numbers were overall backup caliber. Wade also improved in efficiency etc with Lebron. So yeah. Without injuries those seasons probably would have been regarded as some of the best by anybody at his position. Moving on from that point though (contd)",0.9688,93
"Forever Gooner and who would that be exactly? JR has been straight garbage, Calderon has been the only point guard. Crowder looks absolutely awful he can't even hit an open jumper or a layup, him getting more touches doesn't exactly do anything for him if he's straight ass on offense. Let's not even talk about the bench. Only Wade can get his own shot and that's in spurts. Before IT came back the offense was literally geared around Love if you watched a Cavs game they'd make sure he has at least 10 plays total for him in the first quarter alone and at least 5 of those would be in the post. 

The Cavs are a top 5 offense with LeBron ""dominating"" the ball because he doesn't, his usage rate isn't even that high. Stars such as Kyrie (even in Brad Stevens system) and Westbrook hold the ball way more than LeBron does. There problem is on the defensive side of the ball. They're dead last there. LeBron has been their best defender was that's bad because he plays half-assed D in the regular season.

They are more concerned about ball movement than they are about making shots. So who is the real problem here; The guy who waits until his teammate has a good shot opportunity, or the guys who can't hit those shots?  Also, do you know what an assist pass is?  It is a pass that results in a bucket. He is trying to get their scoring numbers up.  If he really wanted to pad his stats he would jack up 40 shots a night and try to win a scoring title.  He looks to get his teammates buckets before he gets his.  An assist is the most unselfish stat in sports because it depends completely on your teammates, right up there with completions in football (although you can pad those by throwing dump off passes in garbage time).  What is more important; how many passes are made, or whether those passes result in points?  It doesn't matter how fast the ball moves, if you don't hit the shots then all you did was play a glorified game of hot potato.",0.9429,282

If he was padding stats why's if he only shooting the ball 16 times a game lol why's he shooting well over 50 percent from the field lol n most of his passes turn into assist because if his high basketball iq .....n the fact that they haven't had another consistent pg or ball handler all season ...🤔hater will hate ....smh IT will slowly along with rose start to pick up assist n handle the ball alot more since they're healthy now ..  Cavs will be a different team to fear by the playoffs... keep hating n dissing lbj because he just gonna shut everyone   up in the playoffs ... Beating gs is probably impossible but God I hope they can lol people will shit themselves n talk about how great the Cavs team is n it's a super team n all that noise knowing they be the same ones right now who said the Cavs roster sucks n it's lbjs fault lol because he chose them players ...

"LeBron works almost exclusively out of the iso. It's a great strategy since one-on-one there's no one who can shut him down and iso plays make it harder for help defense to join in, plus it ices the defender.

The problem with iso is that it *also* ices everybody else on your own team. They're not involved in the play, they're just standing around watching and hoping they'll be the one who gets to shoot *if* there's a pass.

Everybody complains every year about how streaky most of the Cavs shooters are - well, it's not going to change because that's the game LeBron plays. One other guy gets the ball regularly, and that's it. Last year it was Kyrie, this year it was Love (which is why he was doing so great), but now that IT's back *he'll* get all the touches and Love will go right back to being a streaky shooter who can only hope that he'll be involved.

Only reason this terrible style works is because LeBron's such a great talent. Imagine how great the team would be in a *good* system.",0.9834,211

"Lebron has never had an ""ideal"" team. His first finals team had 9 pgs and no backup forwards (you can easily check this on 2K). Last year he was complaining about the lack of a playmaker to run the point as a floor general and the lack of center. The front office then went out and got yet another shooter. By the time they looked for those positions they were out of options, particularly for the center. It was reported also that Lebron at one point wanted Paul over Kyrie, which shows that an ""ideal"" team would have a legitimate point guard capable of running the offense. He didn't get that until this year, and even then Thomas isn't fully healthy. Still doesn't have a center and apart from Mozgov he never has had one. Keep in mind btw that this is not a center that can shoot, but one like Mozgov who can be counted on to be a center. The point here being that an ideal Lebron team isn't ""jump shooters"". In fact, the reason that he likely valued Thompson so much is that initially, before meeting Khloe, he served the missing rebounding link of a center as well as provided great inside presence as a scorer due to his massive motor. And while Love can shoot, he's also a great rebounder and has a reliable inside game (which again, Lebron has no problem feeding to). I think secretly for example, Lebron actually wants the Jordan trade because he's Thompson 2.0, even though most people think he wants a center like Gasol who can shoot the 3. While Lebron values the spacing that shooters give, simply having shooters is not his ideal. Anybody who thinks so is a low-iq casual with no knowledge of even the most basic news surrounding the NBA, let alone analysis of the actual game.",0.9778,349
"Lebron has to hold the ball its the only way he knows how to play. These guys acting like lebron teammates are crazy for wanting the ball to move around. Cavs players want fluid ball movement like the warriors. The ball doesnt stop at curry,kd,green etc. It constantly moves around if green gets the assist to kd its fine. Thats not the case with lebron he holds the ball so he can make the play for his stats. His teammates are tired of it.",0.7571,95
"Lebron holding the ball is the ONLY reason that the offense works. People need to STOP trying to emulate other teams and do what works for their fucking team. These niggas are too in disciplined and too poorly coached to try and swing the ball side to side. I have never seen  moment in a Cavs game where I thought ""God Lebron should have passed it sooner"". What is he passing it into exactly? Like wtf lol. It's the only reason they function in the half-court. The problem is that they play too much like other teams, forcing 3's. They're at their best when playing inside and the best looks for those shots come when Lebron waits for a play to develop or Jeff Green mini-Lebron's his way to the basket. These dumbasses should be exploiting that by using off-ball movement and misdirection but that's Ty Lue's coaching for you. (Ironically, no one seems to mention how much Wade hurts the team with unnecessary pump fakes, which is what really hurts the offense. He'll have an open shot and fake for no reason, which not only slows down the offense but erases smalls stuff offensive rebounding positioning, forcing the entire offense to reset.)",-0.9818,226

Which means that Lebron is willing and able to adapt whatever style of play is most effective.
