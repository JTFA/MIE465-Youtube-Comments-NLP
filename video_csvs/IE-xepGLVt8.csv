People are so dumb nowadays and want to remember their loved ones as good people no matter what it's disgusting. This woman should of accepted the horrific act of her husband and feel shame and embarrassment for having a coward on another man's face,-0.9318,45
"People who commit suicide aren't cowards.  They're very troubled people who have gotten the mistaken notion that everybody would be better off without them.  There was more to Rude than his suicide.

He was, likely, a very good man who made a wrong choice.  He was an organ donor -- which shows that he was a caring and giving person.  No matter how he died, he wanted to pass on what he no longer needed.

It was fitting that his face went to someone whose failed attempt at suicide had cost him much of his own face.

His widow's decision to go ahead and honor his wishes to be an organ donor isn't honoring, celebrating, and encouraging suicide.  The message, instead, is that something tragic has taken place, but let's move forward and see what good can come of it.

I'm a donor, too -- and that includes my face -- and I made the decision to be a donor back in 1963 to be one after reading about Janis Babson who had seen a documentary about donating eyes and decided that she wanted to be a donor.

At the time, she was a perfectly-healthy little girl who had plans to grow up and grow old.  But -- just in case she didn't -- she let her mom and dad know what she wanted done with her eyes (one pair of eyes could give sight to two people in need of cornea transplants).

Sadly, Janis was diagnosed with leukemia not long after that and passed away after a courageous struggle.

Her eyes helped two blind people to see -- and her beautiful story got told far-and-wide, which led to others such as myself getting inspired to donate.

This didn't mean that Rita and Rudy Babson didn't wish that losing their daughter at the age of ten had been nothing but a bad dream but it meant that something wonderful had come out of something tragic.

Finally, keep in mind that even those people handpicked by God to do great things that made them go down in history as Bible Heroes had their flaws.

This man made a decision to become a donor, and the fact that his death came about due to a bad decision on his part shouldn't disqualify him from helping other people to have a better quality of life -- and, in this case, it didn't.

When it comes to an opportunity to help others by giving them something that you no longer need, there is no room for somebody else's self-righteousness standing in the way!!!",0.9716,475

"it's proof that organs include more than fluids and cells. Energy, frequency, memory. I wonder how people still believe it's a good and peace giving thing to disturb somebody in the natural process of dieing by cutting the body open and slaughtering for organs. ah, yes it's the invention of ""brain death"" right before the first heart transplant on a human was possible + big business cheered up with advertising campaigns.",0.8834,80

"these face transplants aren't what they're made up to be in the news. the french woman with the first partial face transplant in 2005 died in 2015 from two types of cancer caused by all the anti-rejection drugs she had to take. until they can come up with anti rejection drugs that don't kill the patient in a few years, and don't have intolerable side effects in the interim, face transplants are purely medical experimentation on humans. surgeons and big medical centers do them for the notoriety and to advance surgical techniques, but they're not good, ethical medicine.",-0.9041,106
