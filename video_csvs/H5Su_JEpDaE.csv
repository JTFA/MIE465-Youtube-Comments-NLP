"I had a crazy cat like that. He was a beautiful orange/amber colored cat and I named him Rico (it fit his personality). I had to put him up for adoption because my mom and I were moving to a place that didn't allow animals. It broke my heart! I loved him so much! The only comfort I got and still get is knowing that he was re-adopted that same day. We made our final move a few years ago and the cat I have now is a beautiful black/brown color. His name is Renaldo. He's literally the complete opposite of Rico lol! He's very calm, he likes to be petted and he likes to cuddle. I'm not parting with him under any circumstances! Well, I'm debating whether to leave him with my mom so she won't get lonely when I move out. But honestly I think I'm more attached to the cat than she is. It might be better just to get another cat for her. But anyway, I'm glad the cat in this video finally found a family that loves and adores his craziness.

 My love for cats came at a very young age 9, I was lost in the woods behind my house and it was getting dark. I was to the point to where I stopped walking and was just sitting down crying. I didn't realize my cat had followed me into the woods, suddenly I hear my cat calling me she lead me to the backyard of my neighbor's house. She rescued me and saved my life, since then I've always had a deep connection with cats. Truly amazing animals! 💙",0.971,136

"She is Amazing!😘❤️🐈
When I adopted my baby girl, they told me no one wants her because she wants to play too much and she bites when people approach her! They made her sound like a monster! Her foster mom was keeping her a cold wet dark basement infested with fleas because she was afraid of her biting her and her cats! She was collecting the check from adoption agency and was treating her like Cinderella! She was under fed and had no one to love or play with! 
When I met my baby girl it was Love at first sight! She was friendly and lovely! Her foster mom said if she doesn’t find a home they are going to put her down at the age of one & half because she is too hyper for people! 
I adopted her brought her home and she opened up like a flower. She start purring, she start playing and slept next to me that night I sang her a Lullaby and she slept like a baby! 
In 4 days we are going to celebrate her 1 year Anniversary living with us! 
She is a love of our life and we are very proud of her. She is loving playful smart and beautiful. She likes to play fetch also enjoy scratching her couch, boxes toys and she has a princess tent! 
I love her more than anything in this world and thank god every day that she allowed us to be her parents! Cant wait to celebrate many many many more happy healthy years with her in our life!
People don’t appreciate the beauty and grace animals bring and they expect them to be a living toy! They are and individual with needs they want Love they love to play and they have like or dislike like we do! I treat my baby girl as if she is a human I let her decide and she always make the best decision! I treat her with love and respect because her happiness it’s everything to me! ❤️",0.999,378
