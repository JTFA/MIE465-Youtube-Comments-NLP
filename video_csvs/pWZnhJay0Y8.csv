Yes. The 2009 one will ALWAYS BE THE DEFINITIVE MULAN for

TOTALLY AGREED!!! Liu's acting is BAD + BORING! I suspect
she was chosen because she is popular in China. I wanted Tang
Wei, who is a far better actress, is good with languages (speaks
Cantonese fluently), can sing (the film Office) + most definitely
fits the role of an iconoclast.(Lust, Caution). From interviews
here on Youtube, I find Liu's English to be lacking; she does not
have an American Cadence, although she lived in the States for
~ 5 yrs.",0.7994,104

Actually Crystal Liu was the leading actress for the movie of the Eternal Love (Aka Ten Miles of peach blossom). Where she had to show a stronger image of a woman especially since it was also gender bender. Basically having to disguise as a male. She also was required to do many fighting scenes and the Chinese entertainment industry is known for their martial arts in the air. The actors are usually pulled up by those strings which is pretty hard to move in.

However, nothing in the poem told of Mulan saving the country, or finding true love, or even coming back alive. So, the entire thing is open to interpretation, or, in Disney's case, their imagination.",0.9602,142

I wonder if Liu Yifei as Mulan could achieve the same level? I know some Chinese actresses such as Zhang Ziyi did great jobs in movies like Memoirs of a Geisha but even she couldn't handle a Hollywood blockbuster. And most movies add Chinese actors just for business reason and their roles are not important.Or Hollywood just doesn't many Asain leading roles so there won't be a chance for her to become another Hollywood star like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman? Maybe only one Hollywood blockbuster and then she has to come back to China. So what do you think? Does Hollywood have another chance for Asian actresses or it's just Gal Gadot? Also, a story happens in ancient China with a lot of Chinese roles speaking English seems weird to me. Btw, your pronunciation of 'Liu Yifei' was kind of cute.

When you look at the cast list for Aladdin they have clearly employed Middle Eastern (Iranian and Iranian-American) actors for other roles, Naomi Scott also has the look to pull of an Arabian Princess.  Most times I would agree but I don't really see why her selection is an issue just because she's from England.",0.5621,86

"You should consider doing more research. Liu YiFei in fact has played a role in which she has to pretend to be a guy before, although it was a rather short scene I'll say, that she pulled it off pretty well.  Also she is bilingual meaning she is fluent both in chinese AND english. No hate, but really, don't judge a person you dont even know well enough to talk about.",0.1901,79

Zhang ziyi  is an amazing actress so always thought she would be a great Mulan.
