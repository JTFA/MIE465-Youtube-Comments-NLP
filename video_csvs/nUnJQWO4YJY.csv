I’m going to try to not come off as a crazy vegan who’s trying to make everyone vegan (I feel like people are entitled to their own decision despite what I morally feel) but all of what I’m about to say is backed by science. There is so much Co2 in the atmosphere that we can no long plant enough trees to save us. Animal farming is responsible for 60% of gas emissions for animal agriculture which is killing the planet. Besides that, our bodies are not made to consume meat: Heart disease, diabetes (yes diabetes can be from consumption of meat), cancer and other harmful diseases and fatal conditions can be reduced and come to an end if the consumption of meat is either reduced or illuminated. Another example is the evolution of human teeth. Our canines are very small and we no longer need or molars/wisdom’s due to us not consuming meat the way early humans did. Overall, humans have been consuming animal product for an extremely long time and there’s no excuse for people who say that there are no options in the vegan lifestyle. From this, humans could not simply just stop all together due to that not being realistic; we would have to  gradually reduce the intake of meat/ animal products but for the people that would be more into just trying it out for a day, go for it. There’s even a thing called the Seven Day Vegan Challenge which is great because you can see what works for you and you don’t have to commit to it unles you feel like this lifestyle is for you.(if you do try this please don’t snackand just not eat. Once again there are PLENTY of options out there. By the end of the week you will feel a lot better) Simply just eating cleaner and healthier would do so much for our planet and our race, the HUMAN RACE.",0.5435,407

"I think this video is great and informative, however it fails to account for the impact of deforestation and for overfishing. Animal agriculture is the primary cause of deforestation. A vegetarian diet alone uses 3 times as much land as a vegan diet, and the regular diet of an omnivore uses 18 times as much land. 
Meanwhile, overfishing is destroying our oceans, causing species to go extinct, damaging the ecosystems of our oceans and creating ocean dead zones. For every pound of fish sold, approximately 10 pounds of “by-kill” are caught and end up dead, often larger predatory fish like sharks or tuna.
Reducing your intake of any animal product is important and effective and it’s wonderful to see a video with this message, however dismissing veganism as only marginally better than the Mediterranean diet is potentially harmful misinformation.",-0.5563,157
"I used to eat a lot more meat. I actually developed copper toxicity from my copper IUD birth control device, it gave me super long heavy periods....

I do tend to stick to a Mediterranean diet, heavy on protein but not all animal sources, I go for fish and chicken (I also like to eat LOW on the seafood food chain, bc predatory fish at the top are both A. Overfished and B. Loaded with heavy metals, and I’d rather have oysters or lobster over tuna or swordfish any day) , rice & beans, veggies & greens, and only crave red meat about once a month anyway.

"It’s true that livestock emit methane and nearly all aspects of agriculture have a carbon footprint; however, U.S. animal agriculture is much more efficient than in other parts of the world. In the U.S., livestock are responsible for 3.8 percent of GHG emissions while transportation accounts for 26.4 percent, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data. In California, 5.4 percent of GHG emissions are attributed to livestock and 37 percent to transportation, according to the California Air Resources Board.While it is vital that scientists in UC ANR, and elsewhere, assist ranchers to continue diminishing the carbon hoofprint, it is also important to recognize that meat can serve as a high-quality protein source as part of a nutritious diet. The VOX video does note that not all livestock is raised equally, and that rangeland can be used to sequester carbon, but it neglects to mention that grazing cows also provide numerous ecosystem services, such as eating plants that could fuel wildfires.It should also be noted how livestock fit into the larger food system picture. Almost 60 percent of the world's agricultural land is grazing land and is unsuitable for producing crops. Ruminants serve a valuable role in the food system by converting the forages humans cannot consume into a nutrient-dense food.UC ANR advisors and specialists continuously strive to improve livestock production practices; however, that is only one of many approaches we need to pursue to solve the challenges of climate change. Time, research and money should be invested where they will produce the most benefit for society. Encouraging people to focus on livestock, rather than on much larger sources of GHG emissions, can lead to policies that slow our efforts to develop more effective climate change solutions.""",0.9831,323

The best diet to fight climate change is veganism. Continue to eat meat if you wish but don't deny the facts.,0.6374,23
"The impact of meat is greater than climate, it's about our inhumane slaughterhouse practices as well. I think that local hunting makes sense when it's about population control and also a more humane way of killing animals while using more of the body for different purposes. I would love to see the artificial meat grown from cells kick off because that would greatly help the climate and animal abuse issue, hopefully the global food shortage as well. There will always be people who don't want to eat vegan or vegetarian and that's okay, finding a long term solution that's kind to our planet and animals is great though. You guys always have such information videos I really love this channel.",0.9621,128
"The main problem is that meat is very, very delicious. Vegetarian dishes are- well- meh.",0.5222,20
The thing that I don't understand is that even if everyone suddenly went vegan all the livestock would still be there emitting methane and taking up resources. If we don't want to kill all these animals for nothing - which I assume we don't - wouldn't it be more sensible to massively decrease meat production and use up the excess meat first before we drastically lower our consumption?,0.3217,70
"The trick to changing ur diet is to just DO IT. I used to love my chicken but i turned pesco- vegetarian (similar to medditeranean, the only meat eaten is fish) and its not that bad. At first u may feel a little empty but it helps to cut down on your weight and of course, help the environment. It’s quite refreshing after you get used to it, like your body feels physically lighter",0.8876,85

"This is all fine and well, but given how large corporations are do they really adjust their production according to intake if the adjustment costs more than the losses? Do corporations really respond to our habits? Whether or not you buy meat, they sell it.

"What I don’t understand is that not eating meat doesn’t really affect the production of that meat so how does it help reduce emissions? Cause the meat just ends up going bad and gets thrown away. And the farms will still keep producing the same amount consistently.

The amount of water and resources wasted on animal agriculture is criminal and could be used for human beings. We should not be eating from the ocean at all.

Renowned Marine biologist Sylvia Earle explains why eating fish is destroying the ocean and why she doesn't eat fish here: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2014/sep/18/sylvia-earle-overfishing-seafood-ocean-hope-spots.

"Yeah but grocers are the ones buying from the market and even if a significant amount of people switched to a less meat intensive diet, there would still be a market for meat and you and I both know that grocers are just fine with throwing away inventory cause the price they get it at is much lower than what they charge. If the demand shrinks due to people switching to a different diet, then the grocer has price changes which increases demand for the rest of the people who still want to eat meat and the market returns back to its original consumption rate.",0.4767,109
"Yes, livestock does have a significant climate impact. I do believe climate change is real and we must all contribute.

But don't also forget what it is that livestock usually eat. It is usually WASTE plants and animals. Which human will eat that?

Similarly, in many parts of the world, so called ""pasture land"" is simply NOT fit for viable agriculture. So you can't just swap one for another. Land is not like cash where if you don't use it for one product, you can use it for another, effortlessly.",0.2554,105
