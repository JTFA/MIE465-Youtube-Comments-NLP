"I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.",-0.0056,157

"I might try that face mask. I have sensitive skin so i cant use much skincare products but its nice to experiment. I cant even use soap on it or face wipes, or my skin gets all red and crocodile-y üòÇ So i just wash it with water, and once a week - usually fridays ill use a nose strip and ill exfoliate with this sugar scrub that agrees with me, and I'll moisturize- i rotate between a eucalyptus cream i got from Bath & Bodyworks or ill use a moisturizing face mask; i cant use eucalyptus too often because it can irritate, plus i have cats who rub up on my face and its quite a toxic plant to them... Id love to find a face wipe i can use, im thinking of trying the Burts Bees sensitive skin wipes for removing my makeup (i only wear it once a week but nonetheless) ....Anyway sorry for the ramble i just like to share and anyone who made it this far id love to hear your sensitive skin care routines!",0.9312,194

"Your appearance is ruined with this terrible ""look"" you've gone for. The shape of your face really calls for some kind of over hanging bangs if possible to cover, especially the side(s) of your giant, strange forehead. Also if you can grow facial hair..and that's a questionable ""if"", you really ought to wear a goatee. (It's not overwhelmingly in fashion now, so that should interest you) The ultimate reason being to add some substance and width to that feminine jaw line where it appears the sides of you jaw is tucking in, concave, under your chin. This might calm the effect where it seems the whole bottom half of your face is dissolving into your pencil thin neck. A neck that hardly exists somewhere above your inward collapsing, Mr-Burns-like-shoulders, only to be defied by the laws of physics in how it is able to hold up those expanding eyes. Between the nose, the the sideways-spreading eyes, and the strangely arched eyebrow- with a giant expansive plain between the two brows- it almost looks like someone has squeezed the bottom of a balloon and the top bulges. You've actually done the exact opposite of what would make yourself look attractive. Do some push-ups. Please. Get some sun, regularly. All this disgusting food you eat all the time is having an accumulative affect on your body. And you are wasting your life. It's obvious that you're aspergers or slightly autistic or something. But it's a real embarrassment for yourself that you should bang on-and-on about all this disgusting toxic food and cliche, novelty fashion; and still think you have some kind of style. God has given you the hardware many would want and plenty say is the top of the Human Lottery: White Male, Light features, Slim build.  Yet the software upstairs is just wasting any opportunity to do something with yourself. Snap out of it! (this could be why many people want to punch you)",-0.8669,373
