Bitcoin and other lesser known cryptocurrencies are scams. About 1000 individuals own about half of all bitcoin and they are manipulating the current hysteria to steal uninformed people's money! China and many other nations have or will soon ban bitcoin from their banking systems and what good is the bitcoin if you can't use it? Coreans love bitcoin because Coreans are really into making money and getting rich more so than other people around the world. That is for very good reasons. Coreans remember how desperate things were not very long ago during the Japanese occupation and the Corean war. Coreans work hard and smart to get money so that they will never again suffer as they did a few decades ago. This is why they will sometimes gamble and speculate to try to make easy money.,-0.2124,145

"I've been following your content for a while (I was the 150,000th subscriber!), but this is my first time commenting. I really like that you guys are expanding the frame of your content, and this is a really cool topic to handle (I recently saw an idol get dragged for mentioning Bitcoin on public broadcast so it seems very timely too). I have a couple of comments tho:

1. I think this video was too long. Maybe 7-10 minutes max would have been better? It is also a complex topic, and there are a lot of technicalities, so I wonder if it could have been a part 1 (intro) and a part 2 (in-depth). But I learned a lot. 

2. It is hard to see the subtitles, especially when there is white/ light backgrounds, so maybe having a low opacity black tab behind the subtitles could be good in the future. 

Great job as always, and good luck with 2018 endeavors!!",0.9803,191

On one hand, we're in this age of technological advent where it's only a matter of time before every physical item will have a digital equivalent so it may be worthwhile to invest in a supposed inevitable. On the other hand it's a volatile market of something that is neither a commodity nor a true currency, not backed by any tangible asset, and has no government regulation. Definitely a risky endeavor but with a potentially high pay out. But Tbh who really knows 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️",0.961,130

So to merge to another system to diversify your options is important. I had information that maybe Russia creates a cryptocurrency backed by gold, if it's true It will be a great succes.",0.9476,127

most in-depth and highest quality street interview video yet! keep up the good work! PS I'm definitely pretty skeptical of bitcoin and cryptocurrency; how can you give value to fabricated and intangible credit? It's not backed by anything physical and it isn't based on true market standards from what I can tell. My impression is that it will cause serious problems just like the unsupported credit system incorporated in the stock exchange in the '20s in the US. I mean the US dollar isn't really backed by anything ever since we went off the gold standard but at least it is supported by a stable economy. But I also think that overall governments tend to cause more harm than good when they become overly involved in the free market and take it as their responsibility to regulate what people want to do with their own money.,0.9332,155
