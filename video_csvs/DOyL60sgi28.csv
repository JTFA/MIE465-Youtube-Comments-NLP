"1) You're accusing me of being dumb when you're rejecting demonstrable science for political reasons and insisting there's a giant worldwide science conspiracy run by Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio and James Cameron.

 2) Gore isn't a billionaire. As of 2017 his net worth is between 200-300 million. Again I strongly urge you to reconsider your sources for information. 
  Just for comparison, how much money do you think the fossil fuel companies of the world have at their disposal? Exxon alone pulls in just shy of *$40 billion* a year. If scientists were all willing to fake their research for money don't you think they'd be faking it for the source that has *far more money* to offer?

 3) Yes, the info in my links is all fed by the same source.....science. You might want to consider such sources when discussing a *scientific* topic.

 4) ""There is billions to be made off of this agenda...""
 ...and far more being made from fossil fuels. So, again, why aren't scientists faking research for the fossil fuel industry? 

 5) Solar and wind were never 'unsustainable'. They were merely cost ineffective before the tech and infrastructure started catching up. They are more viable now than ever before and will only get more viable. Why do you think so many countries are converting more and more of their energy production base to these and other *sustainable* solutions? Why do you think the coal industry is dying? Fossil fuels are unsustainable...literally.

 6) ""But they're all tied into this new agenda of climate change""
 The same way hitting the brakes is tied to the agenda of avoiding a cliff.  But some people are insisting the cliff isn't there and its just a hoax to sell brake peddles....even though every reliable method we have of observing and measuring cliffs is telling us it definitely *is* there and we're driving straight for it.

 7) ""No more of your biased sources""
  I cite sources like the NASA and Nature journal on a scientific issue and you cite Slate and you have the nerve to call my sources biased?
 Are you on drugs?

  8) ""The democrats lobby for funding to further their agenda...""
 Can you not see your own glaring bias here? You keep coming back to political attacks because you know you don't have a scientific leg to stand on. If anthropogenic climate change is really just a giant hoax then it should be trivially easy for you to demonstrate that scientifically without any mention of politics at all.

 1) You seriously need to reconsider your sources for scientific information. While I'm citing respected scientific sources like NASA, NOAA, Oxford, Yale and Nature journal you're citing a few *politically* driven sources. What does this tell you?

 2) You should read the wattsup article you linked more closely as the Ljungqvist reconstruction Loehle is citing as his 'vindication' is *for the mid and high latitude northern hemisphere only* . Also, if you look at the multiple source graph I linked previously, you'll see that the Ljungqvist *global* temp data is already included and it closely matches the other sources (including Loehle's self corrected data). It also isn't a 'smaller scale' as you suggested. Here's some even longer term spreads:
 https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page3.php
 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/global-average-temperatures-are-close-to-11000-year-peak/
 http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6124/1198

 3) No one is arguing or even hinting that climate didn't change in the past. Science has been well aware of that for quite some time. The important point that science is showing us is that the *current and rapid* change in climate is driven by human industrial contributions and is accelerating.

 4) So, you're saying the worldwide scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change is due to some massive, logistically impossible conspiracy to fake science for money and benefit a single party in a single country? Really? Do you have any idea how unsustainable that argument is? Let us count the ways:
   a) The science demonstrating the current warming and its causes comes from multiple countries across multiple governments and political affiliations across several decades of research. Political parties do not control it (and certainly not a single party). If it did we would see scientific conclusions change with political changes (which we don't see).
   b) It doesn't benefit a single party because the problem it illustrates effects *all of us*.
   c) How exactly would such a conspiracy be funded? From what source? Who has the money to pay off hundreds of thousands of scientists and scientific organizations across the planet and enforce loyalty to the conspiracy? Mysterious trillionaire hippy iluminati lizards?
   d) How would pushing a supposedly fraudulent scientific concept about anthropogenic warming benefit anyone? What would a party gain from it? By contrast, its obvious how *denying* that scientific concept would benefit some...namely the giant, wealthy fossil fuel companies who want to keep raking in the money and the politicians they contribute to....but even their own scientists have warned about AGW.
   e) How could such a conspiracy be maintained across the world considering how scientific peer review, repeatability and independent verification works? Other scientists attempting to replicate those fraudulent data would quickly turn consensus *against* the concept. Instead we see the vast majority *verifying* the concept.

  5) Your last link is a particularly funny one because the only thing it indicates is that scientists know which party listens to them and which doesn't....which is the *opposite* of the conspiracy you're claiming that politicians tell science what to say. Nice work there refuting your own argument =)",0.9307,573
"Blue
 Perhaps you've not been paying attention but the overwhelming consensus of the worldwide scientific community and their research falls squarely on *one* side of this issue. I'll give you 3 guesses which side.
 Meanwhile the other side rejects that scientific consensus using purely political, religious and dishonest ideological arguments....and mostly just in one country (the U.S.) 
  So, tell me again, who uses the issue as a political tool without scientific backing? Here's a hint:

 1) You're using the worst examples of your opponents to generalize about an entire issue and anyone who cares about that issue. I could do the same by pointing you to all the Christian Conservatives crazies right here on Youtube who insist any 'bad' event (real or not) is judgement from a god against ideas and people they don't like.

 2) The situation *has* gotten worse each day. Yes we're struggling to find new solutions but at the same time  more and more of humanity industrializes (and population grows) and more pollution and CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere every year (30 billion metric tons increasing annually). Our atmosphere has now passed 400 ppm CO2 concentration for the first time since the Pliocene 2.2 million years ago and this near doubling of CO2 has taken place in less than a century. We are rapidly terraforming this planet and not in a good way.

Agreed. Most people who talk about climate change either puts all blame on people or just make up reasons.

 1) No, over the last half century only a *small percentage* of scientists have predicted cooling and many of those were referring to specific regions and/or time scales beyond human generations. The *vast majority* of published research and researchers have not only predicted global warming due to anthropomorphic contributions to the atmosphere but actively observed and measured it happening.

 2) According to what source are you claiming ""This is not localized cold.""? I only ask because all the scientific sources I've seen thus far distinctly show the planet warming:
 https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/
 https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature
 https://phys.org/news/2015-02-years-above-average-temperatures-climate.html
 https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201313
 https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/temperature-is-rising#.WlAKyTdG1hE
  Please note how I'm citing scientific sources and not political, religious or conspiracy sources.

 3) Exactly how do I ""sound like a liberal""? Because I'm asking questions? Because i'm focusing on reliable, demonstrable facts rather than political propaganda, conspiracy theories and personal insults?

 4) Don't you first have to attempt to engage in an intelligent conversation before you can give up on such? Thus far your only arguments on this scientific issue have been an incorrect assertion about science 30 years ago, claims of a conspiracy to make money, personal insults based on a spurious assumption about a complete stranger and oddly insisting that you haven't personally seen global warming in your 50 years so it must not be true. Where is your science on this scientific issue?

 5) Again, you're the only one here who has brought up money. Its clearly about money for *you* instead of being about observed and measured facts. Why do you think that is?
