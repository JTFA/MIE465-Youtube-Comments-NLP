"Ann Margaret Nene don't want NONE of Miss Haddish, trust. She best stick to them subs.",0.7703,19
As a fan of Nene's I must say I agree. She's naturally funny when she read you but being a comedian is NOT what I can see her doing but in order of getting your feet wet in that comedy field you have to do some shows whether you flop are not you have to keep going and I can give her an E for effort because she's trying..,0.7845,71

Cynthia is so gorgeous! She looks better every year!!,0.8718,12
Cynthia knows nene friendship is a trip but you rather be friends than enemies so let her do her little stuff and still be cool. Kenya is probably the best friend Cynthia will ever have because she needs love and nene sees that. That’s why her jealousy is sparking up.,0.9623,55
Cynthia seems like a real friend I got friends that I don’t pay no mind either like oh really girl okay see you later. Tiffany seeing nene drunk probably just loosening up but still a mess. Andy so shady I worked with nene is she funny.,0.653,51

Fadhil Ramadhani Being funny doesn’t mean you have to aspire to be a comedian.Nene just has funny catch phrases and mannerism that come naturally.She had said that while she was doing those shows she didn’t see herself as a comedian.,0.8126,45

"I think nene is funny lol but I can tell by her behavior when she's drunk everything in sight better come correct.   With her leading success on the number one housewives franchise as an OG, Nene leaks has created a credible brand.  She doesn't slide down poles anymore but she slides into meetings cashing checks.  I'm pretty sure her diva ways are magnified with a glass of merlot.  I can't hate her though. She worked her way up .",0.9746,85
I think the point is you should  go support the comics you think are funny instead of wasting time trying to get people to agree with you on something that's subjective.,0.6597,32
I thought she said on the breakfast club that she was really nervous about snl.,-0.3384,16

Phil J. you are also missing the point. This is a comment section where people can comment all kinds of things. And it is not strictly reserved for the fans.

electric mind it's basic stuff according to you. It's subjective. You don't find her funny but that doesn't mean she isn't funny lmao. Your opinion isn't fact.  and nothing can be learned from a group of people saying they don't find her funny other than there are people who don't find her funny. What a shocker. It makes no sense lol who cares? But if you're into superficial conversations with no substance then have at.,-0.9193,83
electric mind lmfao you're going to think what you want IDGAF point is I got what you were saying but I guess the internet means doing stupid shit just for the sake of doing it. It doesn't have to be a fan club but I'm never going to waste my time commenting on something I don't like or get the point of. You'll never see me on a Britney Spears video saying she can't sing because what's the point? Whether she can or not that doesn't take away from her success or the fact that there are people who like her but again you can  waste your time. Because that's what the internet is for :),0.6774,120
electric mind yes you're missing the point as well. It's subjective. Some will like her and others won't. Doesn't take away from the things she has or will accomplish so why waste your time wondering if anyone else finds her funny or not. It's not going to change anything.

these real housewives need to stay in their lane. when they try to do other things it usually fails. Being filmed going about your business is not a talent. Stand up comedy is a skill.
