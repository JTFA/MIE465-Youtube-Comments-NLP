"Dear Jeremy, 
I must protest a Sin.
Evidence;
11:02 -> ""Even though Spider-Man, Iron Man, Bumblebee, and Nick Cannon are all on this stage in a fantasy sequence, It's still more coherent than most transformers movies.""

Either you are saying that the scene in question should have been incoherent to show the mental state of the actors in question and therefore deserving of a sin OR the incoherent mess that is most fight scenes in movies like transformers should be as coherent as this scene. 

Either way, We demand that you remove a sin from this video final score, or re-visit every other violation of said sin and remove those demerits. What ever you do, Sin counter 2.0 is flawed and needs to be re-calibrated.

You can't have it both ways Jeremy.

Mike was actually born with super powers. But he decided he wanted a more ""normal"" life instead & bacame an actor instead (if you can call being an actor a normal life).

Anyway, the only part he could snag was of Birdman. During that time, he started liking the idea of being a superhero, so he quit the franchise, so he could continue his ""normal life as an actor"".

But, as always the case, he got pigeon holed by Hollywood as a superhero actor. So, he got out of Hollywood & moved to Broadway.

Over time, his urge to be a superhero returned. Mike couldn't live with that, so he tried to kill himself. When that not only didn't work, but he fully healed from his injury, he realized he had been denying what he was his whole life.

In the end, Mike embraces who & what he really is.",-0.6705,196
