"Enjoyed this one a lot. I love me a good red lippie, I try to keep one in my purse at all times. All the ladies looked amazing. And I love the energy of the crew at refinery.... so bomb and bright. Thanks! 💞",0.971,51
"Fellow redhead! I have this kind of coloring, and I've been on a journey to find a good red too! My lips are so pale that reds tend to look either hot pink or orange on me, and don't look good with my hair color. But a red lipstick I've found that is really flattering for my super pale/pinkish skin tone and my dark red hair is Rituel de Fille's enchanted lip sheer in ""love ache""! I love that when I build it up it can be a deep true red on me, or I can dab it on for a natural, sheer red vibe. The formula can be a little tough to work with (a little dry & crumbly before you warm it up) but it's worth the effort for the beautiful matte color, and it feels comfortable to wear! I also really like Glossier's generation g in ""zip"" (similar but leans slightly more orange, creamier formula) and Revlon's balm stain in ""romantic"".",0.9852,189

NARS Cruella!,0.0,3
"NARS Velvete Matte Lipstick Pencil in Cruella is my personal favorite! I got it my freshman year of college as a birthday gift from Sephora and WOW! I always felt (and sometimes still feel) like my other red lipsticks were too bright and coral or too dark and crimson for me to pull off, but this one has withstood the test of time and matched my complexion well year-round! I've also put some of my friends on it and our shade range makes the color pop in different ways but we're all obsessed!",0.9364,100

"Orianna Serrano NARS Cruella is amazing! It's the only red lipstick I can pull off. I'm have VERY fair skin and super dark hair. Most red lipsticks make me look like Snow White, but Cruella looks great! From what I've heard, it's a pretty universal shade too!",0.9617,54

"really liked this video - I have been on the hunt for a red lipstick matching my skintone. I'm a fair skintoned redhead so didn't unfortunately get a lot out of this video because all of the women has very different skintones from mine (olive undertones - i think?) where I have pink undertones in my skin, but I really liked the concept! :-) 
If anyone redheaded gal out there knows a really great lipstick for fair pink undertoned skin - please let me know. I would love to wear a darker red, just because it looks amazing on others, but have no idea how it will look on me.",0.9871,120
