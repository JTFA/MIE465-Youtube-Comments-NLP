"HARDWIRED to SELF-DESTRUCTION no ones trashing Saban because we aren't talking about him. Chip came into a playoff caliber team then dismantled it in 2 years. The exact same thing with muschamp. And then u say I'm not a gator because we disagree if he would be a good coach or have a dif opinion than you. People that truly bleed orange and blue have their own mind. We are allowed to think for ourselves. So don't resort to your bully tactics or your name calling to try to get me to conform to your way of thinking.

"So what you want about Chip but he is an offensive mastermind look at the stats and brought eagles to the playoffs. I personally think he is a better collage coach then pro but if he had the right players in the NFL he could been a nightmare for D coodnators but he should never of took the 49ers job there terrible and hurt his image a bit and getting rid of the good eagles players I don't understand what he was thinking. But I personally wanna see him with the gators I'm a die hard Bama fan but I have always been a fan of chip and his offense.

C'mon Gators bring chip to the Sec and also for my son which is a die hard gators fan!",-0.9275,133
"Stromboli , as I do realize that both college and the professional level are two different things, (how you treat your players, and if your players respect you)...that doesn‚Äôt change ..
