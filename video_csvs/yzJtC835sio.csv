"Love how pure hearted & full of light & love kelly is and honestly always has been.  

Btw shes looking wonderful! But i also love how confident she is no matter what size she might be here or there etc. she knows that its just human to sometimes be bigger & sometimes be thinner & weight naturally goes up-and-down and you can always change it, but the key thing that she knows so well because I’ve watched her speak on it before is that no matter what size she might currently be or hair color or outfit etc..  she she knows regardless of all that superficial outer image stuff that she is beautiful talented and amazing no matter what on the inside & so she always will be on the outside too in her eyes & that’s something we all would be so lucky to believe accept  master & own inside our hearts & minds in this lifetime.    She’s is i said truly a joy & such an amazing talent!  She’ hasn’t let fame or Hollywood corrupt her mind or her soul, she’s completely real and she knows what’s real and she keeps it like that💛💯😄",0.996,220
