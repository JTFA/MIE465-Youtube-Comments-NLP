"Sure, it's nice to open a gift that's tied up with a perfect bow
But the great present of all was given to me long ago
It's something I would never trade, it's the family that we've made
'Cause when we're together, I have everything on my list
And when we're together, I have all I wished
All around the Christmas tree, there'll be dreams coming true
But when we're together, then my favorite gift is you

I would travel miles and miles and I would follow any star
I'd go almost any place if it's any place you are
'Cause when we're together (When we're together)
I'll forever feel at home
And when we're together (When we're together)
We'll be safe and warm
Doesn't matter where we are if you're there with me
'Cause when we're together, that's my favorite place to be

'Cause when we're together, it's a holiday every night
And when we're together, then the season's bright
I don't need the bells to ring (I don't need the bells)
I'll know when it's here (I'll know when it's here)
'Cause when we're together, I could stay forever
And when we're together
It's my favorite time of year",0.9909,224

Lyrics from 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure'
Music and Lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson
Performed by Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell and Josh Gad

[Elsa:] Sure, it's nice to open a gift 
That's tied up with a perfect bow
[Anna:] But the greatest present of all
Was given to me long ago
[Elsa:] It's something I would never trade
It's the family that we've made

[Anna:] 'Cause when we're together
I have everything on my list
[Elsa:] And when we're together
I have all I wished
[Anna:] All around the Christmas tree
There'll be dreams coming true
[Elsa:] But when we're together
Then my favorite gift is you

[Both:] I would travel miles and miles
And I would follow any star
I'd go almost any place
If it's any place you are

[Elsa:] 'Cause when we're together
[Anna:] When we're together
[Elsa:] I'll forever feel at home
And when we're together
[Anna:] When we're together
[Elsa:] We'll be safe and warm
[Both:] Doesn't matter where we are
If you're there with me

[Elsa:] 'Cause when we're together
That's my favorite place
[Both:] To be
'Cause when we're together
[Elsa:] It's a holiday every night
[Both:] And when we're together
Then the season's bright

[Elsa:] I don't need the bells to ring
[Anna:] I don't need the bells
[Elsa:] I'll know when it's here
[Anna:] I'll know when it's here

[Elsa:] 'Cause when we're together
[Both:] I could stay forever
And when we're together
[Anna, Elsa and Olaf:] It's my favorite time of year

"そう 素敵なリボンで結ばれたプレゼントを開けるのはわくわくすること

でもとっておきのプレゼントは ずっと昔にもらっている

どんなものとも換えられない それは私達の絆

私達が一緒にいれば 全部が満たされる

私達が一緒にいれば 願い事だって叶う

クリスマスツリーの周りでは 素敵な夢が見れるのでしょう

でも 私達が一緒にいれば 私の1番のプレゼントはあなた

長い道 星の下を辿って辿って私は旅立つ

あなたがそこにいるのなら どんな場所にだって行く

私達が一緒にいれば いつだってそこが家

私達が一緒にいれば 怖いものなんてない

私達が一緒にいれば どこにあろうと問題なんてない

私達が一緒にいれば そこが私の1番の場所


私達が一緒にいれば 毎日が特別な日

私達が一緒にいれば 季節が輝く

鐘を鳴らす必要はない

私達はここに幸せがあると知っているから

あなたがいるのなら そこが私のいるべき場所

私達が一緒にいれば いつだって その日が1番特別な日",0.0,40
