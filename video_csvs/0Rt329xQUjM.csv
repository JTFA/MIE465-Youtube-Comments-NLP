"WRT pizza roundness, the way you get a round pizza is starting with a round dough. Your technique does not matter if your dough isn't round to start, and for the most part it will be round at the end if you started round at the beginning. You can even use a rolling pin if you want, it'll still pretty much be round at the end.

Also tossing pizza dough in the air is more about making a thin crust without tearing the dough. It's not a huge deal unless you're into really thin pizza, but it's also not as hard as it looks and anyone can learn it with a bit of practice.
