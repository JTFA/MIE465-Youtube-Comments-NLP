After I was done, I told them that every single one of their mostly Pentium 4/D PCs was completely outdated... and that running XP at that time wasn't exactly smart.

I had to write them specs for ""what PCs should we purchase"" and was expecting having to do all the Win10 installs ... but oh no... some smart person was purchasing 400 PCs IN PARTS, because it was cheaper, and I had to assemble 400 PCs as well as installing Win10 and the programs they use.

You can also imagine the kind and amount of calls I was getting from people switching to Win10 from XP.

"I'm IT support for a chain of Casinos and have zero of these as issues. Yes, THIS HAPPENS. But, that happens working at 711. Not everyone is tech savvy. Not everyone thinks before acting. Fixing issues like ""my email is broken"" or ""my computers going slow"" are usually easy. Figure out why, and resolve. You shouldn't be making fun of end user or yelling at the end user ""to stop"". You're not a doctor. You're support staff. You're there to help. I have worked with VPs and CEOs who have virtually no understanding of even what a Word Processor is, yet if they said ""my email is broken"" and I noticed she doesn't even have it loaded, I'd make a joke and smile and set the user up with corporate email. I wouldn't go to their secretary and tell Janet she's not tech savvy.
I wouldn't say IT is ""terrible"" ""hard"" or even ""stressful"". It's variable in job description, it takes patience, an understanding that knowledge is everlasting, and an understanding that not everyone knows the same stuff.
Now, you're in rudimentary IT Support. At possibly the base level of most companies; Or so you explain. Fixing a problem over the phone isn't hard if you understand it (""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"" comes to mind) and walking an end user how to do this should be very well rudimentary if you've been doing this for six years. Likewise; To state it's ""soul sucking"" is obscured -- It's not any different than figuring your way through a puzzle in a game...ESPECIALLY tech support. As for other parts of I.T.; Systems or Administration, Assets, Networking, Compliance, Security, Access, Programming; There are a TON of various different fields within I.T. Most of them are INCREDIBLY fun, especially if you work with or for the right company. I'd argue that Support ""sucks"", but after like 4 months of it, you sort of understand all your roles, and sure something new comes by at times. But it becomes easy. Simple. You understand and develop better management and people skills with this, especially a college graduate.
My point: I.T. Support has it's ""Ugh and it really was fixed by restarting it"" moments, but it's not the only path in this field. And, to be honest, it's incredibly easy if you know what you're doing.",0.9823,487

You are absolutely right. I worked as a tech support for contract for 4 months and it very much is soul crushing. Pretty much you gotta do nothing or just be bored sitting entire time but that's your job you just have to be there for users when they need  you. After working in IT as tech support for 2 jobs i decided to change careers.,0.6369,70

"omg, I helped someone try to recover a file that like, word decided to mysteriously lose (still no idea how they do that) and it turns out SHE LOST IT LIKE 3 DAYS AGO. No, she didn't come to the help desk THE DAY SHE LOST IT, she waited THE WHOLE WEEK, JUST before class, to day the assignment was due. She had like, 3 days to come in ahead of time... or you know... REDO IT, but no, she waited till last minute before class. Mind you, I was just chatting with some friends who work at the help desk, and they couldn't figure it out, so I tried my hand... it was no where to be found. 

Warning for non tech people: If you EVER lose a file, in word. DO NOT SHUT DOWN THE COMPUTER. If you shut down the computer, the file is lost for ever and ever, you will never get it back.",-0.7973,186

""warped?"" she goes yeah i had a problem the other day because my phone's pictures wouldnt load online because i needed cookies to be active, so i asked my mom and she said to bake it in the oven for 45 minutes at 375 degrees.. i kid you not this was a call..",-0.2263,128

me: please insert install cd.
customer: what? where?
