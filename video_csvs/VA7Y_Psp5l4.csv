"*Queen's Gambit Accepted:*
WHITE:                           BLACK:
1. P-Q4                           P-Q4
2. P-QB4                        PxP
3. N-KB3                        P-QB4
4. P-Q5                          N-KB3(?)
5. N-B3                          P-K3
6. P-K4(!)                      PxP
7. P--K5                         P-Q5(?)
8. BxP(!!)                       N-B3
(!!) White's move is very strong.  The intention is to meet 8... PxN with 9 BxP(Check), K-K2 (or Black loses Queen) ; 10 PxN(Check), PxP ; 11 Q-N3, Q-N3(!) (If 11...PxP; 12 O-O with a winning attack) ; 12 O-O, *QxQ* ; 13 BxQ and Black's backward development and exposed King should make successful defense impossible.  However, this variation offered better chances than 8...N-B3(?) Which leads to a rapid debacle.

9. PxN                            PxN
10. Q-K2 (Check)         K-Q2
11. B-B4(!)                    Q-R4
12. R-Q1 (Check)         N-Q5
13. B-QN5 (Check)       . . . .         White has an overwhelming attack.

Now if 13... K-Q1 ; 14 Q-K8 mates, so White wins the Queen and should mate quickly as well.

(This is match #86 in the book ""New TRAPS In The Chess Opening"")

"EMPERORS: Never ignore them.
   KARMA is shallow women with daddy issues having to watch tall ""hunks"" chasing the  petite chicks.😂😂
    They get mad and say catty shit but DEEP down actualy feel MUCH less feminine 😅
Women say eww to short guys. Here is what men say about tall chicks. MAYBE a path of love would destroy being shallow: 

""I think thats a dude""
""I cant hold her with 1 hand covering their ass"".

""Tall girls are awkward""
""Tall chicks cant be pounded all night in a small car"" 😉
""Big ass man feet"" 🙊

""When bullets pop off i want my woman down low with me. NOT the 1st one hit""😨
""Tall women NEVER have cute vioices cuzzz BIG voice box""😉

""No matter how hard they may try, tall women just arent cute""
""Tall women look Redickiliss in cutesy clothes. Stuck wearing suits and dresses made from curtains""
""Tall women shouldnt be so shallow, LUCKY if a good man wants them at all🤔 what with all these beautiful ASIAN women running around"" 😅
    MOST men cheat on TALL chicks with PETITE women 😉☺🤓😈
""Tall women usually walk hunched over, subconsciously trying not to be MANLY 😐
#TaylorSwift would be wise to help alter societies perception of short guys ☺
The HAPPINESS of BILLIONS depends on it!😨 not one love video includes one. Young girls, perpetualy stuck in a cycle of men standing over them! Way to re-enforce this hunny 😝 EQUALS my ass 😅 maybe the weak and stupid dont see the propaganda....1% do! And i applaude those women.🤗👏✊
(PS girl, i can be MEAN or SWEET as pie with little effort).
Have your bangers and mash i no longer give a shit...😑

"My experience of what was ""born on the 4th of July"" was that I walked up the street after waking up and couldn't tell if it was evening or morning, if night or day was coming. It was twilight or dawn and something irreversible had happened and I thought to myself, ""I'll just go back to sleep again before anyone can figure out what it feels like for the streets to be this ______"". Then I watched K-pop videos forever on public access televison. My neighbor was the crippled woman who had been left by her fiance in a coma I went in on. My AA sponsor was a former First Liutenant in the Marines, a Navajo man who shaved her and made her his 'bomb', Abeautiful rock n roll chick he made love to in a state of mute concentration while I ran a psychopathic marathon as the lover she had spurned. On the day in question I can imagine Taylor Swift waking up from the festivities of the party in Rhode Island. Creeping along the bannister guiding herself. Learning to walk again.",0.946,202
