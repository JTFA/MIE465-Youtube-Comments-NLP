Amber Mccoy she is a paid actress on the show they do that every year were they will get a girl to go on and act the absolute worst and be such as “the villain” to build suspense and create drama. At every ceremony they try and make you believe they will go home because if they wernt acting you know they would’ve been sent home but they are an important part of the show they kinda set the tone so at the last rose they will get chosen because they need them to stay on the show until the very end to keep the suspense and drama going.,0.0516,115

I would have been besties with her lol.,0.4215,9
I would not be surprised if the producers paid her to be on the show and to be that obnoxious.  Arie obviously isn't allowed to axe her.  He seems to be willing her demise with his eyes and his voice is like a dad who just ate an air conditioner's size box worth of cardboard when he is forced to address her.  The producers must have ordered him to her room to have a conversation.  He already seemed world weary.  5 episodes in and now he's just broken.  You can tell he has to psych himself into ignoring and placating her because the show needs ratings and she's the real star.  He seems to want to find a bride more than most of the weirdos on this show.  I think he does so good for him.,-0.8016,145

Plus, the first episode when Arie told her ""wow your voice is so soothing"", why did she not tell him ""oh its because I'm sick I sound this way.""?

And if you don't believe me think about it her voice is completely different on TV than it was in this interview. Not to mention I truly dont believe she is only 29 !!! Im 34 and she seems older than me.   The producers probably pay a contestant every season or so if they think there wont be enough drama and gives them a character to play.  Im sure the lead probably doesnt know as well as the other contestants . Just like Corinne going on BIP with a boyfriend at home . Who does that ? Ill tell you who a ""PAID ACTRESS""  And if they arent paid then they for sure are manipulated . Most of these people have a career that will benefit from the show . You usually see people that are Real estate agents, Actresses , people with degrees in broadcasting or that are trying to be in the entertainment industry in some kind of way.  This show will build Krystals clientele and in turn ABC gets a character with a storyline.   Why dont you ever see a contestant that works at Walmart ?  Well , the producers know they wouldnt be able to use them as easy . They probably say to some "" If you do XYZ it will further your career oppurtunities."" 
Just my two cents . I know some are there to really find love and be genuine but not ALL and not this girl.",0.8949,263
