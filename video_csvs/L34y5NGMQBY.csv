"Kisses💋💋💋 to Bughead moments. Adorable couple. Glad they are back together! Oh and the B&V duo. Betty+Veronica=Bestie goals for life 💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️
Also need to send my kisses💋💋💋 to Josie and her badass calling out on Chuck for exactly what he is: a chauvinist misogynistic harasser of women. 
Hisses🐱🐱 to bitch Penny Peabody and chauvinist misogynist slut shaming harasser of women Chuck Clayton. If the Black Hood were to kill those two next, I wouldn’t really mind. Put them in the hole of awful people on Riverdale along with Ms. Grundy and Nick St. Claire.",-0.9571,130
