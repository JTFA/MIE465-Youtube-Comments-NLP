"Getting to know the community, of Spokane has been interesting. Getting to understand the employee problems first hand has been a priceless experience. 

The city of Spokane should be ashamed the way you treat each other..  


Greg Geiger and his wife Jenifer Geiger are lying manipulative trash of people who really don't care about Spokane, disabled people or their employees. Jenifer Geiger called me a coward. So this is what I did. 

Greg Geiger said Spokane is a trash dumb and he didn't know why I wanted to live here because he said it is trash. Well Greg Geiger Spokane Washington isn't trash but maybe people who eat at Burger King are if they support bullying.. 

 If you eat hear you are part of the problem a bully and over all supporting bad people and a bad person yourself.

I got retaliated against because I called the health inspection and they failed by 30 points. The management is corrupt here  Amber Chelsea Adrian very poor quality people. 

I was simply refused to be sold a soda after even being offered a co workers phone number before I said good bye.. I was called the cops on and she was threatened to not give me her number. 

Amber and Chelsea and Gary called the police because they said I could not purchase a soda because I was not allowed on the property because i was no longer a employee. 

Costumers that I had helped and genuinely  listened too laughed at me with no care of anything else.. even a couple terrible people saying I didn't deserve a soda and that they would call the cops on me too.

 When I had done nothing but comply with everything except being removed for no reason for being denied service and me buying something allowed me to get my friends number. ..

 I just find it so terrible to be so careless of others to deny someone a chance to say goodbye. Not only is burger King a bully but this company should be ashamed of itself. 

Of course I did not sit and wait for three hours for the police to show ... because the police is in a budget cut lacking situation of their own.. I find it funny when greg Geiger owner of Burger King allows acid and drug to be sold here but calls the cops when they want personal justice revenge. 

 I can't imagine how much Money I have gave to help people, either customers or other employees. When I was their and I get this kind of retaliation response. . I have opened my heart my home to some and even my Facebook and I would never disrespect people the way I have been disrespected today..

"I think the way I understood it is correct, and this video did not help at first just confused me.

Burger King is representing your Internet provider, and the whole net neutrality is being represented as the whopper  (net neutrality is not so much about general internet speed you pay for, more about the provider being able to profit further from charging fees from specific Internet websites).

This is represented as the whopper, in net neutrality terms it could be your ISP charging you more for being able to use youtube at the speed you would normally be able to use if net neutrality was standing.

 Think of it as basically them forcing you to get their youtube premium membership plan if you want normal speed on youtube, as it is now. Their basically just saying f you, pay us more if you want normal fast service on that website. Much like tv providers, some say ""if you want these specific channels pay us more"".

Its more scummy than that though, since your paying more for just having freedom of speed in any website. Like it is right now. They decide to say ""pay more if you want to use youtube normally, or we'll reduce your speed on it. 

Its like a membership... within a membership, if that makes sense. Kind of similar maybe to pay to win vídeo games, you pay more on top of the game price, to have more fun. Why do that when there are other games who dont make you do this right?.

Except most people are limited to one ISP per location. In order to get another they would often have to move. Or maybe another ISP just has really shitty service and their not even an option. A lot of people are in this situation.

The main thing this video got wrong to me, and its more of peoples fault tbh for not paying enough attention. Is that food service is not a good representation, because theirs lots of diversity and options to choose from.

I see people in the comments saying ""ill just go to McDonald's""

If my version is correct, you're not getting the point. Again, they're representing ISP's. This is not food neutrality, its net neutrality.

As I said, most people dont have the option to simply change ISP, because its not like food service. They're not everywhere, much less several good options. A lot of people only have one option so if they did this, you would likely have to suck it up or move. Aka making you a prisoner if you want any service at all without the burden of having to move etc.

Another thing is, even worse, if every ISP does this, which they could now. We're all fucked. 

Instead of better faster Internet being the competition focus / edge, it would also be ""which ISP allows me to view youtube at normal speed for less"" etc. Keep in mind other websites could obviously be affected too. So It would be similar to tv like I said, kind of like ""social media package"" - ""news package"" - ""sports"".

But instead of channels is the speed limits of these websites. Pay to use them normally like you do now, aka if you paid for 100mbs as your Max speed. Youtube  is reduced in speed unless you pay for it to be normal aka the 100mbs. They could also say,  5$ 50mbs, 10$ 100mbs for youtube. If that makes sense. A membership within a membership.

This is what I understand according to the sources ive seen and trust, some people have different versions or more elaborate ones. Some just lie about it to trap people into screwing themselves.

People who say the whole 2015 thing, when we didnt have it things didnt get this drástic ofc, this is worst case scenario. But not having it does allow shitty practices and they have happened. This didnt start in 15 btw, around the 90s. In 15 they brought it back to combat some of the bs that arouse due to its absense.

"Reading these comments it's amazing how many people are still confusing this issue.  Net Neutrality has nothing to do with preventing the ISPs from having tiers of service speed.  They already have that.  For example: I have Xfinity Blast which gives me 75mbps download/15mbps upload when accessing the internet.  There are cheaper and more expensive plans. Net Neutrality does not hamper Xfinity's ability to charge for their access to the internet at different price points. It stops them from giving priority speed to individual websites that they deem fit, based on their own interests.  Even though I get 75mbps download speeds, without these protections Xfinity can now throttle (slow down) any website that I like to visit, giving me a terrible user experience (UX) unless I upgrade to a faster bandwidth teir in addition to the access I already pay for. They can also force competitors to pay them not to throttle their sites. Basically legalized extortion.  Ending Net Neutrality allows an ISP to legally, and with zero ramification, control the user experience of any website that does not serve their interests.  Since the net is all about user experience, it would give them complete control over everything you look at on the web.  This will trickle down to the end user paying more to the ISPs directly and paying more for the services they want as they pass their new ISP fees to the customer.",0.8333,262

"This was a very bad description of Net Neutrality. Everyone gets the same basic service, but if I want a faster speed I will pay for it. The basic speed and bandwidth has gotten huge compared to 5 years ago. I pay for no data caps and 200 Mbps which is fantastic as I can afford it. If you can't afford a Ferrari buy the Mustang, if you can't afford the Mustang, well buy a used one. I make $30k annually I pay $99 per month for unlimited internet. I am satisfied with my service. I don't use nor pay for cable. I only use my cellphones Wi-Fi feature and sparingly make phone calls. So post paying off my Samsung Galaxy S5 my phone bill is cheap. I sacrifice in other areas so that I can have the best internet connection possible.Last point is Net Neutrality isn't to protect individual consumers directly. It was designed so that ISP (Time Warner, AOL etc.) could not charge Netflix more for higher bandwidth. So during the era of Net Neutrality Netflix was making a killing off the backs of the ISP's. Repealing Net Neutrality reversed this and puts the burden back on to the consumer of the Data, in this case Netflix. I believe this is fair. As data storage and server services are not cheap, under Net Neutrality the cost of keeping up with demand was shared by everyone including the individual consumer. This caused prices to increase rapidly annually for everyone. With repeal of NN Netflix is responsible to pay for it's own increase in usage. My usage as an individual will not increase therefore I will not be made to pay for Netflix demands. In short with repeal to Net Neutrality I no longer forced to pay for Netflix's rising demands of more bandwidth and data, I am only responsible to pay for my share of usage. How the public can be so easily manipulated is beyond me. Do your own research people, do not rely on one group or another to tell you the truth.

Facetimed my sister in IN, I was awed, I never dreamed I would live to see this level of technology. Leaps and bounds every day. The net should remain neutral like electricity, water, and natural gas it's only another utility. Of course, I guess in other countries utilities aren't neutral either.Good job on the video very clever.",0.986,228
