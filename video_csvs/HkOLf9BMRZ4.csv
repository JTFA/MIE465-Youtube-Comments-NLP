"As stated, gadget isn't helping you yet browse an open directory of products, there is a clear conflict of interest, although a brand might recommend you products that actually work, you'll still be trapped under their ecosystem of recommendations, and you might not know what these algorithms are optimized to do; maximize profit? 
It would be ideal, from a consumer perspective, if all this information and analysis is provided and sold on a market like how Helix do DNA samples (in this case skincare, or hair care data) to sell you stuff on a diverse marketplace that is result driven, and not single company owned. 
Otherwise is just a inbred gimmick intermediary between you and a single company line of products.",0.9383,135
