"""I can agree he felt like Nanette was swept away from him but that's his fault for not trying harder in real life.""

Dude, what are you talking about? Nanette was never into him to begin with, why would he need to try harder? This is exactly what men have a hard time with rejection, because they think if girl says no that it's sign that he didn't try hard enough and that he need to try harder next?

"""King of space right here, King of space"". I don't think Daley is as bad as y'all make him out to be, it's a virtual world right, sure he's an ass in the virtual world but I'd have liked to see some of that spill onto the real world so I can really hate him but I guess that's where Black Mirror shines, it doesn't just wanna give you someone to absolutely hate. And it asks the question if an entity thinks like a human, acts like a human, should it be treated like a human? 

For me the real issue with Daley is that having USS Callister made it so he never had to deal with the problems in his life i.e. the problems he had with the people around him, it served as some kinda escape for him but it never made him better because he was still miserable and I'd have really liked to see that issue fester and affect him in a real world scenario. I though him getting trapped in his own game was very contrived because no one smart enough to build a system like Infinity would also be dumb enough to get trapped in there because of an update. Alls he had to go was exit the game when the update was happening so he wouldn't lose his permissions and he could've still gotten all their DNA from coffee cups at work so it would've been a setback losing his playthings but not enough to risk getting trapped in a game.",-0.9816,276

"Definitely a spot-on analysis, but I also think it’s incomplete. When I first saw this episode, I also noticed the subtle commentary on a phenomenon in the tech world. 

When Daly receives the acknowledgement that he was the “Golden Goose,” it easy to imagine that, like many a CTO, his personality became a burden while he saw all others take credit for his work. The truth is, if everyone had the chance to grasp the gravity of the minds that have given us what we have today, we might be celebrating Steve Wozniak over Jobs. And which one was pegged as an abusive cult leader?

I think the episode was designed in-part to allow us to identify with Nanette largely because she’s an engineer who saved the day with her technical know-how. If that’s the case, maybe the main victims had the chance to avoid the situation altogether if they grew up in a world that values intelligence over social skills.",0.9709,184

Obviously in the world of Black Mirror, cookies and similar technology in Season 4 were given rights at some point where they need to be able to express at least 5 different emotions if I remember correctly.

Also, I think the immaturity of Rober that you showed in this video is additionally underlined by his food choices ( pizza, chocolate milk - all what a middle schooler would consume while left alone home for ) and the way he treats people that he has some kind of power over ( not only the people stuck on Callister but also the pizza delivery guy).

"I don't think you can generalize (not that I'm saying you are) all men. I think when we simply atomize other people and ourselves into group vs group; it causes us to think in generalities instead of in nuance.

Once again, I don't think there is ever any excuse  to do harm to others; but if we simply chastise without understanding or asking why, we don't actually solve the problems and prevent the same harm from happening again from someone else. (Basically what I'm trying to say here is that I don't think you can just say ""yup that's a typical patriarchal male there - he just needs to check his privilege and stop acting so entitled."" Though on the surface that cliche fix all phrase addresses some of the surface issues - it leaves a vast expanse of complex and personal issues unresolved and could cause the person to only become embittered resulting in bad behavior justification. For me, the core of left wing politics is people - I actually think it's the duty of society to reach everyone on an individual basis to empower them to rise to a higher level and not simply discard someone because they belong to a particular group - I'm gonna end it here because its turning into a ramble!!)",-0.9718,268

There were some time between people realizing that this copies are sentient. So, most likely our character here thinking he is playing a game just like you thing you are playing a game when you play GTA(or any other violent game). Yes, he is a creepy guy who creates copies of the people he hate, but nothing more. This also very similar to the military tech they used in Men Against Fire.

Regardless of whether or not he had any respect in his real life, it did not justify the sick and twisted acts he carried out in his virtual world.",0.6207,115

"I think that this episode didn't explore both sides very well. It starts with showing how everyone is treating the main character badly in real life (Which is kinda exaggerated because I think if one was a CTO in a gamedev company, even if too nerdy or asocial, they wouldn't be treated like that but have some respect at least and they would all depend on his work. Also, maybe half or a third of the people there would also have similar traits) but then goes to paint him as a total psychopath in the game and the episode even ends with a triumph that reflects the opinion of the narrator of this video and many media reviewing this particular episode at the time, like it clearly taking the side that it's only toxic sexist/racist/gamergate fanboy virgin neckbeards and that kind of shaming crap. Not sure what the creators of this episode were going with this though, but few of the episodes on this season end up like kinda of a good people/bad people triumph rather than making you think beyond that dichotomy. Not sure I liked Season 4 much.

Also, as someone pointed out, maybe he thinks he is playing just a game and doesn't think or believe these are real consciousnesses being tortured, something that unfortunately the episode didn't expand on and instead finished with a cliche nerdy girl triumph against psycho male fanboy.",0.9418,258

She says it with contempt and disgust. Is Robert not a person too? The woman that lets him in every morning doesn't even look him in the eye. He's treated like less than nothing by these people.

As many of these people who might exist there are far more fans who are justly upset with the way the new star trek and starwars has been moving recently, something outsiders don't often take into consideration is that both shows were created by a completely different person now.

I never jumped onto the episode 1-2-3 hate train they all had their purpose but now without lucas the lack of vision is really clear, and Star trek has been going downhill since Gene died we are just lucky enough sometimes to get a good set of episodes in often poorly thought through series though i don't hate any yet, not even discovery but i still don't like it that much.

If you want a real Scifi fan to explain what my real issues are i'm more than happy to do so, but shows like this just boil opinions and feelings into a character who is a dick. and that isn't what is happening in the fandom of either show.",0.7799,220
"I wish more people were interested in actual empathy and compassion instead of just rhetorical empathy and compassion. I think everyone to some level deals with personal insecurities and also have very strange if not reprehensible methods of dealing with those insecurities. Though normal ppl don’t go around making life like avatars of the folks that “wronged” them and then torture them - I think everyone has to some degree a fucked up “real them” - that if exposed would potentially end careers/relationships/reputations etc. I think a better solution is to look for methods of being honest and transparent. Own up to your insecurities and flaws and be quick to forgive other ppl of theirs. I think the main issue is that ppl like playing the victim and like to find narratives that underline that narrative; and in doing so, excuse bad behavior done to others. (This is not a gender or race thing - it’s a human thing) and I think as soon as we realize it’s a human thing that we all are guilty of - we would swiftly move toward actual empathy and compassion. Daly was messed up and probably deserved his fate; but don’t we all? I’d rather look at myself and what I do wrong and improve; instead of reveling in someone else’s demise. That’s what I think is missing in this analysis and in the episode.",-0.1112,270

There were times where he timidly let his computer persona out and people thought it was creepy.

You know how the woman at the desk was fed up with him?  It's because he came in every day and never got his card thing fixed.  

The scene with the black intern seemed really racial where he was trying in his own spineless way to make a black guy do something for him.  Then when he got to the computer area he told the black guy what to do and only accepted slavish obedience.",0.7096,103
"I'm pretty sure the conclusion is meant to be much more symbolic than you're making it.
The point was that we shouldn't let these behaviors slide just because we feel bad/support the person in question.
Like TBBT, for example. The main characters are blatantly misogynistic, but they're painted as the protagonists. Yet their misogyny is never treated as a real problem. It's acknowledged, sure, but that's about it. The writers still want you to root for them.
Black Mirror is basically saying fuck that.
Plus, from the perspective of the AI characters, he is torturing sentient beings.
Thats pretty fucked up. From their perspective, when sentient beings are ready to kill themselves because of the abuse they're suffering, it would be hard to feel bad for their captor at that point.",-0.9865,152

But that’s just my two cents.",0.9806,91
"If a woman thinks highly of a man....she does want to sleep with him. That's literally true.

The issue is that women say that kind of respect is less valuable that friendship or professional admiration. Which it isn't, it's pretty privilege.

Ignoring it, and that need does a lot of harm. You can not replace that ""being attractive"" reference experience like you can't replace the words of a kind mother.",0.9532,104

"It's interesting that we root for these AI and that a real person dies, even though in the real world Daly didn't actually hurt anybody.

A quiet guy who shows up to work and isn't horrible to anyone. Also keep in the mind, the boss IS a shitty person in the world that matters, the real world. The point I'm getting at is, would we rather Daly be this horrible torturer in the real world, or in this digital space?  I think there's more commentary behind this episode that this video didn't talk about, in terms of how the writers were much more clever in holding a mirror to us fanboys. I'm not smart enough to eloquently summarize it, but it's something along the lines of how us fans can easily lose sight of what's real, and care too much about characters that don't actually exist. This based on us hating Robert Daly just because he decides to have anger management in his own digital space, not harming real people, and how we root for the boss because his son was killed (no he wasn't, his son was never harmed). Oh and this is a boss who takes credit for Daly's work.",-0.4868,257

In a “perfect” world ppl would listen and share their thoughts back and a solution would be reached...I guess my point just boils down to “get off your high horse”. I hate that society has devolved into calling people libtards or fascists just because you don’t want to hear someone else’s perspective.

He seems super happy and not used to the attention. Then he overhears Shania tell her to stay aways from him. When she comes back she barely smiles at him and swiftly goes to her desk, looking a little awkward. Still isn't a reason to do any of what he did, but i don't think it's simply because she wasn't sexually attracted to him.",0.7265,129

Eventually people stop giving fucks and vote for Donald Trump just to spite you. And when you see feminism where it does not exist, you look like fools. This video ignores all the ways in which this episode is CLEARLY not feminist and was never written to be feminist.

For instance, the heroine in this episode, Lt. Cole, slut shames Nannette in the real world to force her into breaking laws and committing felonies. It enforces the trope that women who take sexy pics of herself will do ANYTHING to prevent them from being exposed, further encouraging people to hack women. It says that women are ashamed of their sexy images, rather then feeling empowered by taking them in the first place. It further enforces that it is ok to use those pics as leverage against a woman if the ends justify the means. And it blames the victim for not deleting the images in the past. That isn't feminist at all, yet it is completely ignored in this video to make this episode fit a narrative.

Also, in the end, the character is only ""torturing"" imitation of life, so I challenge this channel to make a realistic analysis on another episode of the season, ""Crocodile"" where a woman kills innocent and real people out of pure selfishness.

He is perfectly happy with space fleet to the point that he uses it as a satisfying retreat from all the things about his real life that are not to his liking.

It did remind me of the backlash against the new ST Discovery a bit, with the change to modern lighting and cinemaography on the ship when the Captain isn't there. It also does kind of seem like a satire of EVE Online, space exploration MMO wherein the point is to amass currency with zero regard for others, and actively encourages anti-social and selfish, egotistic behaviour patterns when dealing with others online (and I never realized that was Aaron Paul's voice at the end, lol.

The only difference here is that, in real life where we just go online to troll or just play GTA and kill bots til we get bored. But in this episode we see a private business offer total sensual VR playgrounds for consumers' power fantasy needs. The only thing that really made Daly any more sinister than any other powerless member of society using this tech is his motives - he specifically wants to torture and psychologically crush facsimiles of people that make him feel useless or weak in real life.

"Very interesting. I thought the episode was really great, I didn't interpret his reason for imprisoning Nanette as because she didn't want to sleep with him though. I saw it as an out lash of shame because he felt  hopeful that a person might actually respect and want to talk to him, but because of his social awkwardness that chance was taken away from him. I took the lack of sexuality in his fantasy to be an inner statement of defiance against his ""creepy"" perception by others, and a way of assuring himself that they are wrong and he doesn't want sex he just wants respect and authority. I think despite the trope being overly pervasive the episode does a really amazing job of coming at it very honestly and giving Daly's position a very honest shake before revealing how awful he is.",0.9667,153
"Very nice and well-stated analysis of the episode. I really loved the debunking of the toxic fanboy from Black Mirror. Also something I want to add. At the end of the episode Nanette gives us a last glance. At first I thought that it is that she won and now she and her crew are happy to cruise the vast  universe of this simulation.

I am frusterated by Batman's inability to change his methods even if they result in the same song and dance with high body counts.
