"Hey, thanks for replying to this since the other thread got deleted. When I say ""whore"", I mean ""attention whore"". I believe that Hayley is one of these people who is addicted to having people pay attention to her and fawn all over her, so she makes up stuff about having depression because she knows that's a trendy illness now and people will flock to her and think she's some kind of spokesperson for their depression. I truly believe that it's all just a gimmick to sell records. I mean seriously, take a look at all of the songs on her newest album. Read the lyrics, watch the videos. It makes a Morrissey album look happy by comparison. The final straw for me was when I saw the video for ""Rose Colored Boy"", the newest single. Just another four minutes of Hayley ""pretending to be happy while she's actually sad inside"". It reeks of being a cheap gimmick, and she knows that her main audience, which is vulnerable and gullible teenage girls, will fall for it hook, line, and sinker, and keep lining her pockets.",-0.6249,215

"Yea of course np. It may seem that way but I see two different types of depression she could have which is: Situational Depression aka stress response syndrome or she could have Persistent Depressive Disorder. I know there are a lot of liars out there and it's to pick out the truth and the lies but I feel as though she isn't lying. Sure it may seem as though she's making these songs making it seem that way but if you look at her songs when she had orange hair, she always picked the worst scenarios due to it being relative at the time.  At the same time there is a low, very low possibility of her having HPD which is a disorder for needing attention. Last but not least people look up to her about depression because there are only a few big alternative rock bands that feature sad songs so people will flock to her because they need someone to relate to and feel better. In someways if she's lying then she could be helping people by getting these depressed people that listen to her to go see a psychiatrist or do something other than killing themselves/just being depressed. People in these dark times need a friend or someone to relate to.",-0.9946,227
"You're exactly right about people looking up to her because of depression, and that's why I feel she is nothing more than a gimmick being promoted by record producers to corner the ""depressed teenager"" market. In that regard she's no different than Katy Perry or Taylor Swift or any other corporate, fake pop star. It wouldn't even surprise me if she's not writing any of these songs herself. It could all be a very clever marketing ploy being put on by her record label, producers, etc. She doesn't have the traditional ""pop star"" look, so they decided to market her in a different way, by saying ""Hey kids, look! Here's someone who's depressed just like you, and she's writing catchy songs about it! Don't you wanna go buy her album? It'll totally make you feel better!"" I'm sorry, but I just don't trust ANY corporate music star on ANY major label. I feel they're all liars and can't be trusted. If someone is making millions of dollars off of their music, I don't feel they're genuine.",-0.9518,203
