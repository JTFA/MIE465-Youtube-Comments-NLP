"Chris and Dillon you guys have my utmost respect. Not just because of this video which should be required viewing for those whose world view needs rejuvenating but also because of what you are doing for each other and, in turn, for those who need a helping hand. I admit I have a few years on you guys (OK more than a few) and what I've learned is that after a few years you have the benefit of looking at your experiences, your friendships, your achievements (and failures), in a different light than as young men. You will more fully understand just how much you're influencing and helping others, and yourselves as well. Keep working on that list but in doing so enjoy the experiences of the things you do. Chris don't ever give up, keep pushing, keep your positive attitude. You have what today is a somewhat rare occurrence - a true friend in Dillon who will always be at your side, expecting nothing in return but your friendship as well. At some point in the future you'll recall the things you did and those you helped. A slight smile will come and instantly you will think of each other, whether you're still together or not. That's when you know that truly, you each had the deepest, most meaningful gift of all. A true friend - and there's nothing more rewarding than that. Best of Luck and peace to you both.",0.9979,270
