However  in downtown Detroit there have been more non-automotive companies moving in like Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Amazon Tech Hub, Quicken Loans Tech center, and Microsoft since those tech companies don‚Äôt require as much space.

Also it is fairly well known that London and Paris are similar sized cities yet in this video you portray London to be 4x as large, which is false. Different countries count the population of cities in different ways. For example London's population includes almost all of the suburbs, whereas Miami's population includes very little.

"Very cool. 
The ratios do indeed show a tendency toward a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù phenomena having occurred- but not sure if that logic can be extended to demonstrate that cities are ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù To my mind the better explanation is the desire of certain people to interact at a certain scale; the farmers/rural people I know just despise that scale and prefer a very small scale of people to interact with even when they give up farming. I believe the same is true of cities of varying sizes: people choose a Boston over NYC precisely because it is of a scale that matches the person in question, which automatically keeps cities at different sizes. 
The monetary-efficiency argument makes sense but again it Is totally devoid of the proven actual inefficiency and irrational behavior that people act on (rather that what we assume people do, which is to act rationally). Again, my belief is that it is not something so mechanistic as efficiency but rather powerful desires that are bringing people to cities‚Äîcall it a romance with the opportunities there‚Äîrather than anyone being consciously aware that they might be acting in an efficient way (efficient as it might be to job hunt better in a city). While this might be true, I doubt that statement is what comes out of most people‚Äôs mouths or is a big part of their decision to move to a city. My 2c",0.9848,264
