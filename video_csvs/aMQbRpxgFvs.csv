Biggest bust should of been iPhone X his getting paid by Apple,0.0,12
Bob Jeff as l said before that's tested with the iPhone running ios (light easy to run) and the other phones running android (feature full but hard to run) so you see the unfair comparison if you want to find out how powerful a phones HARDWARE is then the SOFTWARE has to be the same but people seem to be extremely dumb and don't understand you can't compare a green apple to a red apple if the green apple is actually a pair (green and red being hardware apple being ios and pear being android) so it's 1 an unfair test 2 nobody cares because apparently comparing pears to apples is 'fair' 3 your wrong or more precisely the website that spewing bullshit is wrong,-0.9647,133
Bob Jeff he just mentioned the Note8 is more efficient in everything then iPhone,0.4754,15
Bob Jeff it simply isn't though because android has a 10 core 2.5ghz proccesers in the xiaomi redmi pro (Mediatek MT6797T Helio X25) and the adreno 540 in all flagships which is a  10 core 710 mhz BEAST of a gpu so android still has the upper hand the reason why the iPhone x is apparently 'faster' is because it runs ios which is a very light small and simple os whereas android is a lot heavier and more feature full than ios,0.4939,88
Bob Jeff the optimaztion isn't actually on apples side it's actually due to the fact that 1/ 10 apps make it into ios and ones that do (asphalt 8 airborne for instance) are usally locked at a low graphics setting with LITERALLY (not even jailbreaking since the high quality textures aren't even included) no way of changing that so it LOOKS more optimized but no apple are just trying to make it easy for themselves rather than actually making a powerful phone,0.8984,87

"I like the note 8/ I think it was basically the best phone, but I feel like almost all new phones aren't worth buying right now, mainly, because of the aspect ratio/ when you watch a video you get black bars and you dont get to utilize the entire screen, so basically your loosing some screen, the last good phone made by samsung was the note 4, it was an upgrade from the note 3, the note 5 is a downgrade, in some departments compared to the note 4. Honestly if I was gonna pick the best phone on the market I would have to go with the Razor phone, it has a normal aspect ratio / resolution as well, it has a 2560x1440p display 120HZ/refresh rate and an amazing 4,000 MAH battery, which is unheard of and dual cameras, anyway its the best phone on the market, there's one other phone that may also be a runner up to it and that's the Sony xperia premium phone , its nice, but its aspect ratio is also not normal, although sony beat samsung to the market with a 4k phone/ sony was the first company/ maybe only company to have a 4k phone on the market. Anyway the Razor phone is definitely the best phone on the market. Also the two best budget phones right now are the LG stylo 2 and LG Stylo 3.",0.9953,259

1: if Apple chips are so fast and so good then why is android's market share getting larger
2: Samsung make in house chips as well that are also almost as bloody large and as far as l researched 6 mbs of l2 and 6 mb of l3 cache on the new exynos 9810 chip
3: Apple is still overpriced even with that massive CPU :p
4: you said in theory in which case it can't so by time that happens some new advancements will most likely have occurred in vulkan
5: Qualcomm had the best 32 bit processor and now they are playing catch up due to the sudden release of a 64 bit CPU but since they were at the top whats preventing them from catching up and making a better CPU
6: Apple's GPU is still shit so the API doesn't actually make a significant difference since Apple's GPU's are playing catch up


if you can answer every single point with at least one good reason then l will stop this argument",0.7203,182
Vamsi also btw l build comps locally for people and have built and upgraded my computer and l'm currently doing computing at school so l do actually know a lot about tech >:(,-0.5719,33
Vamsi its not just cores its about clock speed as well and also both CPU's run arm x64 so the only difference as you said was API and OS and thats what l was saying its not a fair test the iPhone has it easier than the android phone since the API is lighter but not as user friendly or as advanced as openGL or vulcan (S9 uses vulcan API rather than openGL) so they should mod the android phones to run IOS then it would be a fair test and in this case android would win,0.5837,99

"gamertrons
1. CPU's are much more complex than clock speeds and cores. Things like IPC differences can cause some significant perf differences.

2. Vulkan is much more complex than metal 2, But as far as smartphones are considered there isn't much difference in perf b/w them due to thermal constraints.

3. Metal is actually easier to code and run. In comparison to OpenGL it can increase draw calls 10X  in theory.Vulcan can run it 5x than OpenGL

4. L levels cache is a very imp factor in CPU's and apple is always the best when it comes to memory management and single core perf. OS complexities have nothing to do with the  open standard synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench or AIDA 64. They run on open source API.

Bottom line is every person with some tech knowledge know that Apple has more powerful processors than the competition, even die hard fandroids accept that. Even Pixel phones can't compete with iPhones as far as RAW performance goes.
