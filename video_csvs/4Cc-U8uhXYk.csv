"""Cool tones should avoid copper colors."" WELP, I have cool tone skin and I'm a coppery red ginger naturally.

I'm really wanting to go platinum again but when a stylist did it, it fried my hair something awful. (I never put more than lightener on my hair before yet she still made it spaghetti) When I did it, the toner did nothing and I just had a orangey yellow which oddly enough didn't look awful but I wanted to try richer jeweltone colors instead. Eventually I just gave up and went back to my natural hair color. My hair now is as short as yours and I want to have fun with it but I'm worried I can't because of it being auburny ginger and never bleaching right. D: Help!",0.6538,144

Every time I click on one of these videos I hope they will talk about olive toned skin and they never do, or they talk about it as if it just means tan skin. Olive toned skin is like its own subcategory of skin tone. It’s not pinks or yellows it’s green. And there ARE people out there who have olive skin and are pale. Like no one ever talks about it. There’s hardly any pale olive foundation out there and I spent years trying to figure out my skin tone before someone explained olive skin to me.

I even never thought that green would look good on me, but quite a lot green tones, looked awesome along with petrol/turquoise and blue-tones. instead some orangetones are looking terrible on my, especialy at autumn when I still have a little bit of tan. so...
