Not once have they gotten blown out all year but when it matters most, they do. The NFL wouldn't have made money if the Vikings went to the super bowl, at least not as much. The best defense in the last decade of the NFL doesn't just give up like that in a championship game. Now Brady will get his 6th ring. I'm just about done with this team. I can't take the constant disappointment year in and year out. No, I'm not a fair weather fan, I'm just tired of losing. This team will never win a Superbowl. Ever. Mark my words.",0.6864,183
