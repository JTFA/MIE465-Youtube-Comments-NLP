"After seeing this video, I have a lot of respect for Morgan’s extremely graceful exit. I had a totally different impression from watching the show. I have watched all the seasons of RPDR over a triple, quadruple plus times. What strikes me most in this video is how Morgan has mentally/maturely evolved. Being able to express thankfulness, being self-aware and not beating up on him/herself… clearly already winning :-)

 Now I’m actually sad she got home because clearly she got caught in her own mind. The edit and content I saw was of a much more insecure and unstable person. I hope they give the second chance like they did the last All-Stars!",0.9612,132

I think the bottom 2 would have been safe compared to the talent show last year. Anyway I wasn't impressed with Morgan, Milk or Chichi, but out of the 3, I feel that Chi Chi was more talented, she was just outshined by Kennedy, Aja, Bebe and Shangela who danced better than her. If I had to pick one to go home it would have been Milk. Top 3 were Aja, Kennedy and Ben.",0.8472,113

I have mixed feelings on Morgan's elimination...she kinda set herself up for it but based on the performances i was least impressed by Chi Chi's which kinda breaks my heart cause i think she was so exciting to watch in her season.
