Dont get me wrong most this video was great and you shouldn't turn a blind eye to our negatives either. But to show california the most and not show a town of farmers in iowa help a widow pull in harvest after losing her husband to cancer is to veiw ""AMERICA"" thru a very narrow lense.

"Some real mis-information in this video; some common liberal myths. 
Let me straighten out a couple here:
1. The USA DOES have an official language, and it IS English.  The ability to read, write, and speak English has been in the US Code since 1906, as a requirement for immigrants to legally become US citizens. As the purpose is clear, that does make it official. And by the way, the entire US Code is in English, as is the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, all Congressional and Supreme Court proceedings, etc.  Yes, since 1999 there have been a couple of bills pushed around, essentially to apply the word ""official"" and to even reiterate what is already in the US Code. Much of that is to put to rest the annoying assertions of naysayers who try to pretend English is not the official language.
2.  The Pledge of Allegiance was NOT ""written as an ad for an American flag retailer"". It was written as an improvement to a previous pledge to the flag that had been in use for years beforehand. Yes the new version was first published in a children's magazine as part of a nationwide Columbus Day celebration, while there was also an ongoing campaign to get flags in public schools. The true motivation of the author was a nationalism movement to instill patriotism and love of the country.
Apparently the goal, along with some of the imagery included, to make USA patriots appear like self-serving capitalists and uninformed hillbilly oafs.  But as one of our greatest conservative patriots, Ronald Reagan, once said: ""The trouble with our liberal friends is not that they are ignorant.  It's just that they know so much that just isn't so.""",0.981,329

We also have the police cone and escort us and block traffic so we can all stay together. There's alot of off road groups like that and they'll join us as well. It's awesome they picked that clip,0.9022,101

So that's why there's confusion -- in other areas, ""America"" is referring to the continents of South/North America.
