It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen


So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies


I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
