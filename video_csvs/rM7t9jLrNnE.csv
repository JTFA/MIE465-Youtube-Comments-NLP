"Hmm, seems pretty expensive to measure every new field and report exact camera angles. With todays home computers, you can make a live frequency analysis that can determine where the white lines are. If you have some measure of where the starting point for the attacking team is, and if the white lines are 10 yards apart and at least two are in the pixture, you can use this frequency to draw a parallel line on the field ten yards from the starting point live, without any additional external measurement needed. The fact that this is a camera feed would make the algorithm even more robust as you have earlier images to compare to. The occlusion of the line by players is solved in real-time already, as the video stated, so that also is no problem.
Should be possible for the NFL to set up a decent computer somewhere to perform these calculations and forget about all that measuring and camera angle and position measurements.

"Seems unnecessarily complicated. Why can't the software just take a shot of the field from each camera angle before the game and create a model of the field as it actually looks at game time? Then find the lines actually marked on the field, which probably aren't exactly 10 yards apart, and aren't really lines, but rectangles. Then when a first down is called, calculate the appropriate parallel line, and replace the pixels that match the pre-game image? Or the image just before the play begins, to account for the field getting messed up? 

It doesn't seem to me that it calls for mathematical precision: Where the ref places the first down on the field is pretty approximate, and the linesmen then have to figure by eye where to put the chain markers on the sideline. Also, it can't be totally automated: a techie has to click on the first-down marker to tell the software where to put the line, and at that point, wouldn't it be even easier for the techie to just drag and drop it by eye? If it looks good close up on a 4k screen, it should look good to the folks watching at home, and probably better than the ref can judge it down on the field. 

Though it sounds like fun software to write, and no doubt created dozens of jobs, it does seem like using a hammer to kill a fly.",0.9578,264
