"You wouldn't need them in a bombing run because the whole purpose of this was to try and bomb the Falcon or at least draw it out of hiding. Interceptors would be pointless because all they would do ,in this case, would intercept the Millennium Falcon if the unlikely event of it coming out of hiding and trying to escape. This is probably why they chose to use Ties instead because of their multi-purpose in a battle.Â
