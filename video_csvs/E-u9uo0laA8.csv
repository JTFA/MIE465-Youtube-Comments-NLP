"[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Bottles in a bucket full of ice (yeah)
Better make room, vroom, hear the Lambo (celebrate)
Bitch, better believe that I'm a sniper (yeah)
You know I'm 'bout to take you from your man though (celebrate)
Pop up with the chopper at artificial niggas actin' like bitches
It done started up a epidemic
It don't make a difference, nigga we winnin', I'm plenty grinnin'
Hundred million platinum, fuck it, you ain't gotta listen (celebrate)
You better step down to me
Feel the dick, bitch, open up your mouth for me
Now choke, talk to the dick, honestly
I'm dope, bitch, comin' like Eenie Meenie Miney Mo (celebrate)
I don't like when I lose (I don't)
If I don't buy her them shoes, I don't like those (regulate)
Do anything that I want to
Think I'm gon' dance on the moon like Michael (elevate)

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas & Chris Brown]
While I'm drivin', I'm moonwalkin' in the sky with some shooters
We jump inside of the Buick, you duck and hide from the Rugers
A couple choppers, acoustic in the guitar with the music
Guess I'm alive and I use it, get stuck inside of the cubics
I never lie, but the truth is I'm fuckin' tired of these losers
And all my life want the food when it's supper time and the juice
But I'd rather die than to lose, it's a matter of time 'fore I lose it
And strategize with the movement-t-t-t-t-t
Walk in the trap like a boss, ooh
Ho, you know I'm drippin' with the sauce, ooh
Pretty, with a face full of scars
All they did was build me up, try to take me apart
They ain't ever wanna (celebrate) like you have a label
Call the doctor, heard the chopper make 'em do the Macarena
All you niggas sweet as candy, chocolate chip and Now and Later
Jolly Rancher, Snickers, bubblegum and watermelon flavored
Get the paper, I'ma (celebrate) on the corner
I heard you niggas got the juice, but I got Corona
I got a little Spanish bitch, I call her maricona
Joyner Lucas, bitch, I'm hotter than a fuckin' sauna
Yeah, I make you niggas (elevate)
All you new niggas don't do it for me, look (woah)
Bitch, I'm the professor, you a student to me, woah
Designer shades on, like you cooler than me, wait (ayy)
All we do is win, you a loser to me
Rappers wanna talk about battle me (Joyner)
You can't give me neck with a mouth full of cavities
Bunch of lil' niggas tried grabbin' me (grabbin' me)
Five foot five, boy, you niggas like half of me
You don't wanna see the other side of me (yeah)
Hard to make 'em happy, all these bitches stay mad at me
I just might take her out to Applebee's (Applebee's)
