"Doug Jones is a brilliant actor. He must have a ton of patience to put up with all the makeup, too. 

There was a short-lived horror anthology on NBC ten years ago called *Fear Itself*. Some episodes were garbage but some were brilliant. He starred in one called ""Skin and Bones"" in which he plays an emaciated man who is taken over by a wendigo. The makeup and his performance make it truly frightening. Apparently, someone put a copy on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22nd6ff8Y_U) if anyone is interested in checking it out.",0.8968,105

"I feel this same way about Hugo Weaving. He's like my favorite actor of all time, and no one knows who he is. Everyone has seen at least 3 of his films, but nobody knows him until I point it out, and they're like,  oh yeah, I know him. He was V in V for vendetta, the voice of megatron in the first 3 live action transformers movies, the red skull in captain america, he was in cloud atlas, oh, and a tiny little film trilogy called the matrix as Mr smith, among many other roles, a lot of indies. He's fantastic, but nobody I talk to has never heard of him. It's frustrating.",0.85,133

  Real world vehicles as well.  Like the F22 and F35, F40, F50, F150, F-this is boring.
For the most part, he is finished writing and designing shizz, but alot of his work will see the light of day for a decade or more.
  He doesn't do autographs, appearences, meet and greets, Hollywood award shows ect.  
  He might write another comic book series with a limited run of a few years.  But you won't like it! ",0.3131,145
