They will always try their best to sing it live and its absolutely amazing! I've been to their concert in 2015 and it's incredible! I can clearly hear that they sang it live and not lip sync! Such a true performers with great talents! Keep it up guys! Just to let you know that each of you did a great job since debut! I can't even choose any bias because I LOVE ALL OF YOU BECAUSE YOU GUYS BEING YOURSELF AND HAVE SUPERB TALENTS ! Namjoon, if your ever read this. Please translate it to others so that they know WE ARMY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU!! Please stay together until you guys get married one day!

"To all the people who are saying they sang to a track. After the show paperwork was revealed that showed which groups sang to backing tracks and which ones lip synced. BTS was the only group who was designated as LIVE only. No track. They even had live music played by a band/orchestra that they performed to. You can hear when their voices are stronger, weaker, and when they are breathing due to the hard choreo. Anyone who has seen them perform live at their concerts knows how good they are live. They are known for it. It is a point of pride for them and ARMY. Very few groups can perform so well live, at such a demanding level, and for so long without a break. RESPECT.",0.3909,145
