"Maybe, just maybe, they're trying to showcase women besides supermodels since their customers are largely, you know, not supermodels? Lmao wow shocking, I know! You mean everyday women want to buy makeup from brands that employ powerful women they can see bits of themselves in??? Amazing. Who would've guessed.",-0.5057,61

"Some parts are cringe worthy. Nice try in trying to top what L'oreal have been nailing for years. Nonetheless, Raquel is the most effortlessly perfect for Revlon new set of casts (eventhough Revlon focuses more on that so called supermodel Ashley and Adwoa & she seems like got picked for this just for the sake of Revlon to have one supermodel-material person for this brand - bit saddening).",0.9182,74
