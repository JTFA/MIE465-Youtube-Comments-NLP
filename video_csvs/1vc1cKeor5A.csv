"Aside from the premise of the protagonist wanting to be a musician despite the disapproval of his family, and the movie being framed around the Day of the Dead, the two films don't actually have that much in common. Their takes on the Mexican afterlife are pretty much unique to both movies, and while BoL is a story about love triumphing over violence, Coco is about finding the right balance between being there for your family and following your dreams. 
In my personal opinion, while I appreciate the wooden carving aesthetic of BoL and the designs of the three gods, _nothing_ can beat Pixar's talent for visuals. And I also think Coco's use of music to further the story was better than in BoL.",0.9081,134

"Good thing I waited until last week to see Coco when Olaf's Frozen Adventure was taken off. Coco was a rare combination for an animated feature. Colorful animation, poignant story, refreshingly decent musical narrative, whimsical comic relief and surprising plot twist. Which reminds me Andre I don't blame you the surprise villain trope is getting old already. But the revelation of who Miguel's true great grandfather is was forgiving. But I would have enjoyed the movie even more than I actually did if Mama Coco was a female lead character along with Miguel and we spent equal time in both living and the dead. My dad cried when Miguel sang Remember Me to Mama Coco. As for Olaf's Frozen Adventure, I watched it last Thursday on ABC and it was a fun special.

It just set out to tell a good, authentic story that would mean something to the people that watch it. And death, family, and remembering the people that care about us in this crazy world called life, is something all of us think about. This film made me love the people in my life more and has encouraged me to put more effort in those relationships. That's a special thing a movie can do for someone.",0.954,155

"Thank you for drawing attention to the qualety pacing in Coco, and the sence of sitting back and enjoying a story.  One major problem that has persisted in cinema for several years now is pacing.  So many films today feel like the director and producer started out with an draft of the final script and made up the finer points of the story as they went along.  The result is that most movies I've seen in the last three years lack a sence of direction, while also being inconsistent in story drive and tone.  If you are looking for an example, take a look at Big Hero 6.  

Overall, pacing just doesn't seam to be something Hollywood is placing an emphasis on.  This is a tremendous shame and contributes to why so many films in recent years blur together and are hard to remember.  If the nerrative is given out like a two year old running a fauset, the human mind will remember the story with just as much acuracy.

Anyway, thank you Andre for bring attention to the pacing in Coco.  It really is a film made with passion and love by people who cared, and it shows.  Almost Happy New Year and thanks for the review!",0.9753,226

The 'leaves' are petals from marigolds. These flowers are very symbolic for day of the dead and the petals spread on the ground (or the bridge) esp. are supposed  represent passage for the dead.,-0.8625,41

"The ending of this movie made me cry, not gonna lie, but I have to say, of all the afterlives out there, I most wish this one is the real one. The idea that your family is still all around you, even when you can't see them anymore, is honestly the best part of this movie for me. As long as we remember them, the people we loved are still here and that's probably a hope everyone can find some warmth and comfort in.",0.9851,94
The movie was amazing!! Sooo beautiful!! I cried a lot haha,0.8825,15
"The only good nothing about the ""short"" is that if you're running a little bit late, you can relax because it's 20 minutes‚Äã long and you know you'll have plenty of time to get there, get the tickets, snacks, use the restroom, take a short nap, and it still wouldn't be done.",0.7003,62
