After so many minutes of watching, the Youtuber gets credit and paid.  I forget if it's 4 or 6 minutes but it's frustrating when I get pulled in by a title or photo only to find out I'm  not getting what I thought I was getting.  But Dr. Lee would never do that.  It just triggered my anger and I shouldn't have used that tone.",-0.891,107
"Actually, it is noticeable if you have a missing earlobe.  Would only remove an earlobe if a skin cancer involved a great portion of the ear, and in fact in that case I will often try to leave the top rim of the ear at least, so that the patient is able to at least hang glasses from it! There are attached and not attached earlobes, but they are still earlobes.  Missing earlobes will draw other people's attention easily",-0.1134,86

I dint feel happy or comfortable and the pain was horrendous and he had to reinject a few times as I wasn't numb.

By pinching and shaking you are overwhelming the available bandwidth along the nerve to the brain and filling it with signals that are not pain. So where you would have been sending 100% pain signals down the pathway you are now maybe sending 50% pain and 50% shaking/pinching. Thus...reduction in pain.,0.8445,61

"Dr. Lee, I'm wondering if you feel critical of these people who stretch their earlobes.  I imagine you would not think highly of the practice, although I know you wold never say anything negative to a patient.  Surely, you would recommend that people don't do this to their ears.  I have seen some cases in which the earlobe was repaired, but due to the size of the hole, it will never look very good.  A person can end up going the rest of their lives feeling self conscious about their ears due to a crazy trend they followed when they were young.  

Love your videos and your amazing, positive, happy attitude.  God bless and Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah to you and your family.",0.9901,139

"Having a doctor that is personable and doesn't just talk Dr talk is what saved my life. I was in a car accident broke my back the hospital I went to didn't do everything they should have. Had me walking and moving around bc they didn't check my back even with me saying it hurts and my legs feel weird. After my parents demanded an x-ray of my back they discovered L4 clean break and had flipped 180 degrees. L5 was shattered. My parents wanted me transferred to an hospital and wasn't going to hear out what any Dr had to say bc of the way they handle things. Then walks in the neurosurgeon sits down beside me in my bed and tells my parents the truth his thoughts on how things were handled and what he felt needed to be done. Talk about his daughter and how he would feel in their shoes. And bc of him I am walking have had children. He would not leave my side til I moved my legs and cried with my family when I did. Because he came across as a person not just a Dr who knows it all at 17 I was able to continue to live a somewhat normal life.

I was wondering - are you seeing more requests for earlobe repair compared to say 5 years ago? 
I know quite a few folks who stretched their lobes in their teens but are now in their late-20s - early 30s and regret the choice.

In the UK, corrective surgery like this is considered elective and isn’t always accessible or affordable.

I like seeing someone else who does the shaking while injecting.  I used to have a dentist that did that, and it's really amazing how much it helps lessen the pain.  I wish my current dentist would do that.  I think it should be standard practice for anyone holding a needle lol.",0.9584,92

I do remember one study saying that by using epi in with the block, it can cut down on the need for tourniquet use.",-0.7579,98

Many many more never listen to the audio track on the video, so as Dr. Lee goes along and explains stuff, they remain in the dark.  And finally probably most viewers never read Dr. Lee's video notes or are willing to use google to do a bit of research themselves when they have questions.

Before starting, always explain that you're a nervous Nellie, you want everything explained to you step by step,  and you would appreciate the doc going as slowly and gently as possible.

ancientsgate I agree except for the younger dentists being the only ones who know about the gateway nerve thing. My dentist shakes my cheek when he injects and he's in his 60's.,0.3612,36
"ancientsgate, I  certainly can't speak for all facilities, but I  know they are moving away from latex gloves. We changed the boxed, non-sterile gloves years ago to powder and latex-free. In the OR, we were pretty much latex-free. Most latex allergies are contact and produce a rash from minor to severe. There are the few that have the severe anaphylactic reaction. Regardless, it's just easier to be as latex-free as possible.",-0.1655,82
"ancientsgate, I have heard some humdingers! Like she said, oftentimes, it's a sensitivity and not a real allergy. Or it can be a side effect and not an allergy. Many people report codeine makes them nauseous. That is not an allergy. It's a side effect. Usually taken with a little food will do the trick. I've heard,"" Ativan makes me sleepy!"", ""epinephrine makes my heart race,"" ""prednisone makes my face swell"" that's what I remember,  but I have had difficulty keeping a straight face as I explain the difference!",-0.2444,111
"ancientsgate, I remember when you told me you were now a Hospice patient, broke my damn heart. I luv ya too, my dermatology dumpster diving buddy 😁 I appreciate your informative comments, along with so many others. I always have. Hang in there, and don't stop hanging out here ❤💕",-0.2987,59
"ancientsgate- not all. We did some cases ""straight local"", not just dental cases either.",0.2263,20
"c coop thanks so much for your answer. So many new protocols, products, and surgeon’s choices. So happy I don’t have to learn it all again.",0.7841,35
"c coop were those patients also getting IV sedation? Usually surgical dental cases in a hospital setting, the patient would be sedated, allowing for a less-strong Lidocaine dose.  Just a thought.",0.0,36
"c coop, I have been on this ""concoction"" since 2004; the doctor hasn't had to up my dosage since that time. It's great that the device works for you.",0.6249,35
"c coop, it was too late for me to get it implanted (my condition had progressed by that point), and they like to implant these early with CRPS, complex regional pain syndrome. So yeah. TENS didn't work, so they just assumed it wasn't going to work either. I'm happy enough taking medication now, though, so it's no problem (Neurontin for the most part, and buprenorphine pain patches and some sublingual buprenorphine for breakthrough pain - that's my pain control in a nutshell).",-0.8735,97
"doc your professionalism precedes you. i would be  more than happy if you attended me, and i would know that you and your staff would put me at my ease and extend every comfort imaginable. i think that we, as patients, must inform our doctors beforehand if we are very anxious, prone to panic, etc. so that our experience is mutually beneficial and that the outcome is a win-win effort. every patient is a whole world of their own and it takes a great doctor to ascertain their needs.",0.9019,99

"glauvie, It's funny when ancientsgate has to tell others that no, she doesn't work for Dr. Lee. She just really loves the gooey gunk, as we all do, and finds every part of dermatology very interesting, as she's said so before. And being one of the longest term subscribers and a smart cookie to begin with, Dr. Lee should make her ""headmaster of comments"" to scan them and give her input, unless it's something she's not sure of. Ancientsgate has always admitted when she's not certain of something, or if something is her personal opinion only. But what she knows, she knows! And all of that makes her comments very trustworthy. Love ya AG ❤",0.9563,134

"thank you, I really am hesitant to show my personal life a little but I guess I gotta let you guys in a little haha.  It's very weird to me when people recognize me in the world and kinda freaks me out.  Weird that that makes me more nervous then cutting human skin haha",-0.1787,57
that help your patient not to worried the pain,0.0742,9
this sounds a little weird but I understand what your talking about because my OBGYN would gently smack the top of my butt right as he gave me my BC shot. I would laugh and ask him why and he said it tricks your brain. so yeah I thought that was cool. By the way it worked,0.9509,60

"why don't you just remove the earlobe? plenty of people have absent/attached earlobes naturally, so it'd look better than a scared repair?",0.159,27
"xx oo backatcha Fides. You are too sweet.  I don't want any kind of special recognition.  Dr. Lee thanked me privately back a few months ago, and that was more than enough.  I just have fun here (trolls notwithstanding!) and enjoy helping others learn a little bit, if I know anything I can tell them.  I am in hospice care, as many of you already know, so I'm never sure how much longer I'll be here, but for now, this channel enhances my life, and I would be sad if it no longer existed.",0.3008,111
yes there is a reason to my rhyme hehe  thank you for being a fan and being patient while I try to figure out a new way to post videos and still give you all what you love!,0.8999,39
