"I'm a river, I keep running on
I'm a pillow, you got used to leaning on
Underneath it there's a person
I'm a woman and I'm hurting
Cause I feel like I'm holding up the world
When I lay this burden down
Who's gone take it up for me?
When you run me in the ground, that's the day you're gonna see
For all I done, all alone
Just for a moment can I not be strong?
So how about now? 
How can I lay this burden down?
I deliver each and every time 
I'm a giver, I don't think about what's mine 
You keep asking, you keep taking 
And there's no reciprocation 
I shouldn't have to do this by myself 
When I lay this burden down, who's gone take it up for me? 
When you run me in the ground, that's the day you will see 
For all I done all alone 
Just for a moment could I not be strong? 
How about now? 
Can I lay this burden down? 
I'm a river I keep running on 
I'm a pillow you used to leaning on 
Just this once, just this once 
Can I lay this burden down? 
Can you take it up for me? 
When you run when you run me in the ground, that's the day you will see
For all I done all alone 
Just for a moment please could I not be strong? 
Wish I knew how, how to lay this burden down",-0.9864,269
