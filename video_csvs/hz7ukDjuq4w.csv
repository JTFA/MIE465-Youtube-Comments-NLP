The cop turned on his lights and sped past me well i was still doing 150km/h and a while up the road he shut his lights off and slowed down to 10k over the limit i fallowed him till my turn off came to go home. My question is why do you think he didn't pull me over and give me a ticket? Was he just trying to prove to me that he is faster then i am or was he cutting me a huge brake i don't know what do you think?",0.504,192

"Officer 👮‍♀️ 401 my dream job was always to be a police officer and specialized in gangs so basically become gang unit and then throughout the job career become homicide detective. But it hasn’t gone quite there yet things in life have happened that has kept me from achieving my dream. But there was one time where I did applied for an agency and was Disqualified for to many discrepancies. I didn’t put down on your personal questionnaire paper some information that I wasn’t even aware of like did you quit a job without giving any noticed I say no and when PI when to my prior employments they all made me look bad. And another one was have I ever been involved in a civil lawsuit I said no because I really want yet but my prior employer assume I was suing them so they told that to my PI another one was has your CDL ever been suspended and I said no because my current dmv printout was clean no record and my PI pulled out an old dmv printout from a prior employer and that one showed my CDL was suspended back in 2012 and all this took place on 2017. My question to you is can I still applied at other departments and follow my dream or is my dream pretty much crush already from that outcome? I stay out here in California, oh and by the way that position I was applying it wasn’t a sworn in position it was going to be working for the California highway patrol but I was going to be and inspector, what I’m basically asking is can I still become a police officer? I have no criminal record never done drugs.. I had a lot of employers and because to be living better and it offer more pay. Can any of that effect me?",-0.9246,340
