As a home cook I find cooking very exhausting but at the same time very calming. I can't even begin to see myself as a line cook in a fine dining restaurant; the stress alone is mind blowing! And why are they so under paid? $12-$15? Minimum wage in N.Y. was just raised to $15 in some areas. I would think a line cook would make at least $17 an hr for the long shifts they work. I hope Nana will succeed in owning her own restaurant someday. She seems very down to earth and very pleasant.,0.9298,115

 A great chef makes the restaurant, a great line cook makes a great chef look better. Restaurants are like going to an orchestra of food...highly choreographed, very admirable, but only difference is we cannot see the performance, only the result.

"Welcome to the craziest journey of your life. Enjoy the experience while it lasts, even though sometimes, many times, it feels like hell. 

As a white male, I couldn’t imagine the extra hurdles you have to overcome, but believe me I know what it can be like in that furnace. 

Always remember to keep a calm head and never let anything get personal. Not from colleagues or client or suppliers. The sht never ends, but it’s how you rise up and meet those challenges which will ultimately make it. 

I burnt out in my twenties. I ended up switching to the dark side (front of house). Went through every possible position in every possible style of venue. From a hole in the wall to enormous hotels servicing thousands. 

I ended up finding my nich as a barista. Loved every moment until my body couldn’t handle it anymore. 
Throughout all the years ever since my very first job flipping burgers at 14 I confused what I thought was simply stress with what was actually cancer slowly creeping up on me till it was too late and I broke down in unimaginable pain in the middle of Christmas Eve service. 

Now I barely leave my bed. Not a day goes by I wish I was either back on the line side by side with my warriors or back behind the coffee machine making magic and turning every frown upside down. 

I’m an introvert but I desperately miss that moment where I could make any grumpy person, about to start their own job at 6am, smile from either a casual chat while I make their coffee or when I saw their delight at taking that first sip. 

All I wanted to do was make people happy. It’s why I chose hospitality. 
The ability to completely flip any persons mood and make them happy was my rush. 

Now all I want is my own pain to end. Every night before I sleep I beg that I won’t ever wake up. 

Take care of your body. If it’s giving you a sign of distress, don’t ignore it. Don’t be a hero, you can’t care for others if you can’t care for yourself first.",0.982,426
