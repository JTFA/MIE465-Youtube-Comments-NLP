"Octavian Mihai *Oh you speak an the behalf of all the true evidence.* First, you mean ""on"" and not *an*. And yes,  The evidence is the reality of the world. The earth is 100% calm, still, fixed, and motionless. Looks flat, feels flat, and all the stars, sun, and moon travel around it. Yet you would believe otherwise based on dogmatism, indoctrination, and fake photos and theories. That's reality. Not a 1000mph spinning ball. 


Now that's laughable. See, that's what pseudo science is. The globe and heliocentrism. The globe and heliocentrism does not follow the evidence where it leads as nature completely contradicts these theories and leads to the flat motionless earth. First strike. 2nd. It does NOT embrace criticism, it is hostile towards it. You question the globe and you are automatically ""a moron idiot retarded conspiracy theorist"". 3rd. Their claims are unverifiable. Why should one believe in the theory of a spinning ball earth when there is no physical evidence for it? And don't say there is, if there was, who would deny something so plainly obviously? Not even a fool. 4th. It cherry picks only favorable evidence and relies on testimonials and weak evidence. (Eratosthenes) etc. And it does not consider all arguments and counters. And lastly, it is dogmatic and unyielding.


The globe is just based on ignorance, deception, dogmatism, and propaganda. There is no proof at all for it.",-0.9862,292
