I love this video. These are the warmest most compassionate 2 people alive. It would be such an honor to live near them. They have taken a huge role in the Kangaroo rescues. They so badly need to expand their living/shelter but they can’t do it alone. They need the financial help to make a move like this. This is their life and dedication. They are absolutely amazing people. Their hearts and billfold never stop giving for these beautiful Kangaroos Anyone that can should give to this cause. They have a wonderful loving relationship with their rescues. Kangaroo’s are very important to the whole world. Please help them secure a sanctuary for these precious babies. 😇,0.9956,134

"Nah, vermin are rats imo. I'm not saying that they're not overpopulated and cause issues, but ffs at least their native! I have family who live down south, I live in Perth, and they shoo away the roo's because they eat their fruit tees! And again, the're overpopulated in some areas because of human activity [food form farms]. If we helped dingo numbers increase and reduce roo's access to farmland, we'd be able to limit their numbers. At the end of the day, we changed the environment, so we need to protect it. Where you at? Also, just fyi, it's hard to read your paragraph because of no punctuation.",-0.428,129

"On average, Eastern grey kangaroos grow to about 7ft and 120lbs. At around 18 months of age, the joeys are released back into the wild. It's policy and also, if the males are kept longer, they can become aggressive because they're maturing and also trying to establish their alpha male rankings.",-0.1027,58

"Skulls Ain't Dead so you live where i live do you if you saw what i see in a regular basis you'd feel the same way dont get me wrong i love kangaroos but they are out of control and are a pest in places the definition of vermin is wild animals which are believed to be harmful to crops ,farm animals ,or game",0.6806,66

"They're not vermin (unlike rats, cats, wild dogs, wild pigs and boars, cane toads, foxes, camels etc), but they're overpopulated in some areas because we've decreased the number of dingoes and made more farmland available to them (increasing food supply). Adding back more dingoes can reduce roo numbers and help restore the ecosystem, so native plant species can thrive and farmers don't get so angry.",-0.016,79
