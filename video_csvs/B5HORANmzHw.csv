Eventually you'd have a large enough size on Mars that it'd work out just fine. Say, within 500 years, you maybe be able to send groups of 1000+ humans every 20-50 years, and that's not accounting for when recreational travel between earth and the colony become possible, and interbreeding between the two planets happens.

Also, people are definitely going to have sex with people they're not supposed to mate with. What happens when someone gets pregnant from someone they weren't supposed to be with? Will people even have a say in how many kids they can have or if they can have any? From a purely number standpoint I'm sure things could be worked out. But from the standpoint of human behavior and actual logistics, things are not going to go so smoothly.  Something being possible isn't the same thing as it being feasible. I'm not saying that a colony like this couldn't happen, but it's even more complicated than what one short video can explain. A lot of things would have to be very strict in a colony that is just starting out, and for the following several hundred years or more, in order to ensure stability an health in the population.

"Instead of leaving it to nature why not use gene editing? Take a genetic bank along with you so there are more genes available for inserting in the lab. After removing any disease genes use an algorithm each time a new child is to be born to edit genes in a way as to achieve a certain degree of genetic diversity. I'm not sure what the ideal there would be. If there aren't any drawbacks to too much genetic diversity then the algorithm could make sure that every gene is used with roughly equal frequency.

Alternatively the mere presence of the genes in the bank may be enough to safeguard the colony. If there ever is an infection which would be defeated more easily if the colonists' genes were tweaked scientists could study the disease, determine the gene, and just copy it from the gene bank and edit everyone's genome or give them the proteins that the gene produces (which ever turned out to be more effective and resource efficient).",0.7999,182

"Nice video about a fascinating subject! I have a terminology quibble.

""Effective population size"" doesn't at all mean what you say. The concept you're going for - a lower bound on the population size needed to avoid inbreeding depression - might be better described as ""minimum viable population"".

Effective population size is a property of a population (any population, whether it's viable or not). It's a rather abstract way of measuring population size, taking into account (among other things) the number of reproductively mature individuals and the sex ratio. The point of effective population size is that it better captures how a population behaves genetically than simply counting the number of individuals (which is called the ""census population size"").

Effective population size is always at least somewhat smaller than census population size. So the way you'd use it in the context of space colonization would be, for example: ""we have 1000 people on Mars right now, but many of them are children, so our effective population size is closer to 400"".

It'd be great if you could add a correction note to the video, this is a very central population genetic concept that a lot of people have trouble with! :)",0.971,232
