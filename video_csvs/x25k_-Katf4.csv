Trujillo was a monster. All Dominicans agree. In what we disagree is that without some of the atrocities he did we weren't exist as a country.

Is well documented how much he try to make the Haitian government take care of the owns citizen but they didn't. They didn't even bother the massacre it was the international community the ones who complained.

If are going to make a video this serious. Is good to at least know details. The Haitian government committed massacres against dominicans like "" el desguello de moca "". The Dominican Republic at that time already lost the entire region of ""Hincha"" becouse of letting haitians live there.
