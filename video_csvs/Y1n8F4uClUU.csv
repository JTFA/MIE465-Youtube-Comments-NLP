A real thing that's a fact. Your precious Iphones are built in what could be called forced labor at the Foxconn Building. Where work conditions are so poor there are suicide nets surrounding the building. Apple HQ is based out of The Isle of Skye another tax shelter. another fact! Obviously I know WTF I'm talking about.l. Fox owns WSJ and they have an agenda to push. Go educate yourself. Until the next reply from some public school indoctrinated shill Peace out.
