This one needs more cocoa and is too sweet. I also made a blackberry filling, which I believe is necessary to keep this cake from being too heavy or sweet. The added acidity is 10/10. Oh and make sure to finely chop the chocolate before adding! This cake is best served warm and is excellent with the modifications!",0.9789,100

You might have to order the dutch processed cocoa online depending if whether or not you have like a baked goods store or not. Same with the espresso powder. It requires mayonnaise to moisten it up some, but I promise you will not taste it. It's a really rich cake so be warned I guess lol.",0.906,96

If you whip up store bought icing you get more from it,0.0,12
"In my personal opinion as a former culinary arts student to people in the comments: having two layers of icing helps. 

The first layer (after cooling the cake in a refrigerator overnight) is the crumb layer, this layer keeps all the crumbs from getting all over and in the buttercream/icing people see. Let it set for two hours or overnight.

The second layer is your nice layer, smooth it out, design on it, it’s gonna look nice because there’s no crumbs in it now!

Crumbs in icing is just my biggest pet peeve 😂",0.7424,111
