most athletic league? why because they‚Äôre tall? thats pretty subjective. just depends how u define athleticism. yea nba players are tall and strong but there are plenty of sports that require people to run much faster and farther lol,0.8079,45

the NBA is boring as shit and the all star game is worse.   Every all star game sucks.    The NBA doesnt need LESS defense.,-0.9041,27
wasn‚Äôt he complaining about the format saying it‚Äôs the worst thing that could happen to the NBA?,-0.7096,22
"what a clown, why does this guy have a job in sports anymore, his opinion is irrelevant. I love how his opinion has been relegated to the all-star game which is essentially a glorified globe trotters game. And he thinks the players should be playing harder in the all star game? They literally get no breaks from basketball and now they are forced to play in this stupid scripted event instead of resting. I dont think anyone really watches it anymore honestly, maybe just the dunk contest. But how is this crap still on TV, I have never watched steven or skip, and ever learned anything I didn't already know. Why these sports-talk segments continue to exist I will never know.",0.4767,133
