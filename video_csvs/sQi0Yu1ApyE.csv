Here in the south we are raised with guns in the home from birth and you are taught not to mess with it. It's not a toy. And for the avg. folk who can't afford security you own a gun to protect yourself. I raised 3 sons as a single mom n my boys all survived and they didn't touch my guns!

On the same token, hammer is used to kill people because someone with a wrong intention used something that is so useful, to use it to kill someone. 

All I am saying is that anyone can make anything as bad as the person who is holding it.
The only way to stop a bad person with a gun, is a good person with a gun. It's better to be a warrior in a garden, then to be a gardener in a war zone.

You‚Äôll need the police‚Äôs guns to take away other people‚Äôs guns. So you‚Äôre very pro-gun; you just believe that only the Government (which is, of course, so reliable, honest, moral and virtuous‚Ä¶) should be allowed to have guns. There is no such thing as gun control. There is only centralizing gun ownership in the hands of a small political elite and their minions.

Just like they say, people will make war no matter what they use. If we don't have guns, they'll use knives. Take away the knives. they'll use arrows. Take away arrows, they'll use stones. Take away stones, they'll use sticks. That's just the Very nature of mankind. And mankind been warring since it's existence.. If you Really want to stop gun violence you should invent a time machine and go back to the 1960's/70's when they were making a bunch of cowboy movies that glorified guns and shooting and killing. And take away toy guns, and those assassination/fighter type video games. The problem with our generation is we have desensitized people from an early age and made guns and killing fun and games. Take all this back the last 60 years and you will see a whole lot less killing and a lot more people still living.
