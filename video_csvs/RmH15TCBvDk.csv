"What?? Music sold on the iTunes store was MOST DEFINITELY NOT DRM-free at first. They only went fully DRM-free in 2009, which Amazon had already been doing for a year. They were the followers, not the innovators. And if you wanted to get rid of the DRM on songs you had already bought, you had to pay $.30 *each* for the privilege of ""upgrading"" them. How gracious.

Which brings me to point 2 -- the vaaaaaast majority of that space is going to be wasted. I have a 128GB SD card in my own iPod Video (using the iFlash-Solo from Other World Computing) and it doesn't see anywhere near all of the songs on it even when using large, high bitrate rips. I have the same problem with my car stereo's USB reader. There just isn't enough database cache to make use of all that storage, and there's no way to upgrade that.",0.6272,178
