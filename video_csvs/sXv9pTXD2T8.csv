Your responses are ignorant, obviously banh mi is going to be made traditionally from the country it came to be!

A normal burger or sandwich would probably use only lettuce. Maybe some avocado if they're feeling fancy. The banh mi really shows the true potential of vegetables. I always ask for extra onions or tomatoes when I order a burger haha.",0.9226,76

"exactly, I do respect the original French baguette, but in order to make a proper Banh Mi, Viet bread (thin and crispy on the outside, soft and pretty airy inside) is needed. And we don't have to argue with anyone, I simply want to share what I know about Banh Mi with Byron and everyone who is interested in that famous street food.",0.9465,72

the pate makes bahn mi tastes like shit.  This version makes it edible.  Everyone fuck off.,-0.6808,19
"thePowerPlant  It seems to me that the Bahn Mi is like a burger in that there are infinite possibilities as long as it has the core elements.

Burger: meat patty (could even be black bean/vegan), pickle (salty/tangy element, could be pickled or regular ginger), Ketchup (acidic condiment, use your imagination), and veg (lettuce, tomato, and onion or anything crisp and flavorful). These are the archetypes, but it doesn't have to be literal.

Byron's take here is a tasteful but individual version that preserves the character of the original. If restaurants only used the authentic recipe for everything, it would be very boring. All the 'roles' are filled. It would be one thing if he was writing a Vietnamese cookbook, but not everyone in the Bryan's audience has access to exotic ingredients.",0.0799,163

"yes ^^ that's the trick that many Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam use ( but not everyone willing to share) to marinade grilled pork. Actually, what they use usually are: garlic, shallot, lemon grass, soy sauce, honey, condense milk, oyster sauce. Some people might add fish sauce, white parts of green onions, 5 spice powder....Make a slight change, and you'll have a different flavor.",0.1901,81
