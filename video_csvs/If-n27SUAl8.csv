"Sadly, this was the last time the neighbors were ever seen again...on Earth. You see Michael comes from Narnia and once again that land was in trouble. He was looking for some help and didn't know where to turn. Using a social experiment trick mastered by his ancestors; he was able to recruit worthy candidates for his quest. Rest assured, the great war is now over and all of his neighbors were triumphant. You can now find them at each of their very own castles throughout the magical land. -True Story-",0.8316,104
