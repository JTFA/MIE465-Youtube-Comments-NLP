How many of you want a Queen that has public pictures of her boobs hanging out or a TV star.  She is an Actress that grew up in Hollywood.   She knows how to play many parts well.  Henry is so very naive.  Falling in love in 3 minutes is called infatuation.  Henry has never been considered the brightest bear in the woods.  She is far more educated  and experienced than he is.

The ability and resources are there in tremendous abundance. Just no willingness to do what is right, just, loving.
