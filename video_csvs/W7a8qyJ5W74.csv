"""YOU DON'T GET SPICE SUPERPOWERS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUNTRY EATS HOT FOOD.""

üòÜ Straw man logical fallacy. In many cultures, spicy food is very much prevalent, and the more spice you eat the more you adapt (Humans adapt, go figure) and the more you can tolerate. It's simple. Spicy food isn't that prevalent in White European countries, but it is very much the case in many countries in Africa and South Asia. 

Many Indians could wipe their ass with that chip - figuratively and literally. üòÜ",-0.6956,100
