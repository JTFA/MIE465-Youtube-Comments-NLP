"I've always hated canoeing, it's extremely hard to do and I had a bad experience with it a couple years ago where I was sitting in the middle for 3 straight hours. I was doing an Adventure Race with a team of 2 other people and our goal was to find flags placed around a lake and stamp a card with the ink blotchers that were tied to the flags. I was on my knees the entire time. My teammates were being really rude and wouldn't switch with me. I couldn't walk after. 

I've always loved kayaking though and I would consider myself an expert at it because i've taken 5 years of classes for it. Would definitely recommend over canoeing.",-0.0992,129
