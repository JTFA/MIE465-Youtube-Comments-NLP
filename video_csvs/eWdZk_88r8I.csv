"ICANのノーベル平和賞授賞式に招待をされながら出席を拒否した5ヵ国は、いずれも核兵器保有国。
広島から空輸された被曝ピアノで演奏されたこの曲が呼び掛けているメッセージはすなわち、あなた方が核兵器を廃絶しここに来なくては世界が滅んでしまうという呼び掛けです。
核兵器の犠牲となった名もなき人々は世界を憎むのではなく、核兵器の廃絶を呼び掛けていることを知ってください。
神のみぞ知るではなく、人間がそのことを知るべきであるという想いが授賞理由であり、この祝賀演奏曲のメッセージです。

父の大好きなザ・ビーチボーイズの曲に託された核兵器保有国への願いを込めて。

God only knows what I’d be without you
