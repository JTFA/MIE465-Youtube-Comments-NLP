the men are technically cleaner- it would take far too long to elaborate but if you know snowboarding you see where the women (and men) go wrong, or could improve, when maximising rotation, take off, carving efficiency (or general edge control) and aggression. 
The women simply don't ""send it"" like the men do. Partly a confidence thing perhaps. Recently women weren't even doing 1080's, they were winning gold medals with 540's etc. They haven't bevome genetically stronger or anything, they're just behind the men at putting everything together. We will see women landing 1260's and even 1440's in the near future, I know it. But they will always be behind the men due to athletic and perhaps psychological differences in ability.",0.9286,204

"good question. no, it's the same course. the honest truth is that the men are just better all round. they have more strength and power needed to generate momentum when descending or ascending the pipe (you may see them pump their legs), they also have superior technical control with their edges, allowing them to get more grip and not lose speed on the transitions. ironically in the video above, when they are talking about how chloe has the speed of shaun and the power of the other female olympian, you can see in the clip that chloe's board scuffs up the snow and doesn't hold her edge properly like a scalpel, scrubbing speed through excess friction and lack of control. this combined with the physiological advantages men have with spacial awareness and the ""flow state"" (being in the zone), we see the men able to look far more stylish, effortless and natural whilst gaining on average nearly double the amplitude over the lip and doing multiple 1440 and 1260 degree spins in one run (the women can't do over 1080). yet nobody openly talks about this because we live in a culture that expects more of men and less of women, so when women do well they are compared as equals to the men, despite being objectively inferior athletically, yet when men do far better than women they are overlooked because they are held to a higher standard, a male standard. it's good that they are judged differently as they don't directly compete, it would be unfair for women. but look at chloe's ""perfect"" run vs shauns and you will see a huuuuge difference. the worst male snowboarder actually does better runs in qualifying than chloe's gold medal run, look for yourself :)",0.9685,326

"jiminal07 - As far as spatial awareness is concerned, there is no definitive proof that a man is superior.  Yes there are papers that supports it but there are plenty of research that refutes it or said it's inconclusive.  So no spatial awareness isn't an proven fact. Besides this isn't a spatial problem for females.  It's not like they have trouble spinning and landing their tricks cleanly.  The clear difference here between male and female is that women can't generate enough speed and power to propel them high in the air for them to spin and rotate as fast as men.

Sure if you define athletic abilities as just strength and explosiveness then that's fair.  Both of those has to with physical attributes which as I said it is the clear difference.",0.942,142
"jiminal07 - Athletic abilities and spatial awareness are very subjective measures.  Besides there's no clear definition of what athletic abilities entails.

"not smarter. i'm not sure where you got that from. just mentally more adept at performing at higher levels (more confident in their own abilities, aggressive when the pressure ramps up, less self-conscious, willing to push into a darker place when necessary). You glossed over my key phrase: on average. there are no dogmas or absolute facts in life regarding animalistic patterns, but yes on average men are genetically pre-disposed towards higher co-ordination, athleticism, and the fight or flight instinct, we have evolved to hunt and fight and COMPETE, physically and mentally. Men literally grow up needing to compete for women, it's in our dna to compete. This poses issues socially at times, and we see areas of the social environment where women are far more adept than men, with a natural empathy etc etc. But if you compare the most athletically demanding sports in the world, these show the greatest performance divides between men and women. look at boxing or mma, the most intensely demanding sports on the planet- strength, speed, co-ordination, power, control, technique, mental acuity under immense pressure. all of these things are required to compete at a high level. there has never been a female fighter comparable to a male fighter, that i'm aware of, but more importantly on average it would be suicide for a woman to fight a man of similar experience and size. saying they are just ""different"" isn't an answer, it's just navigating a truth you are not comfortable with. A singular piece of anecdotal evidence from an american televised obstacle course doesn't communicate any coherent point either. my mum smacked my bum as a kid but it doesn't mean she's athletically superior.
women are not unequal to men overall, but we both have differences and abilities in different areas, generally.",-0.2494,344

"strength and explosiveness are athletic abilities. spatial awareness can be measured with spatial awareness testing- it's a thing and it's proven men to be superior. look it up yourself. if these individual characteristics are so subjective and hard to quantify then what is the best way we can quantify them? by performing athletic skills (such as snowboard halfpipe) and comparing the performances (derived through athleticism and spatial awareness) between the men and women. then you see that the men are far more capable. because they have more athletic ability.....

athleticism
aθˈlɛtɪsɪz(ə)m/Submit
noun
the physical qualities that are characteristic of athletes, such as strength, fitness, and agility.",0.9608,128

"when mothers make poor decisions and marry bad role models for their children because they are naive.... we see a lot of answers.
inconvenient fact for you: the average son is capable of far more, athletically and mentally, than the average daughter. look at any olympic sport, or sport- not many where the average woman is as capable as the average man are there? but no let's all carry on pretending that men and women are the same lalalalalalala",-0.5574,88
