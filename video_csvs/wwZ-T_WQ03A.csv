...Every time you say emotional inteligence..... just no that is not a thing some try to make it a thing but it is just not there is no connection to intelligance there you could call it emotional intuition or something along those lines the ability to gage emotion is completely appart from the concept of intelligence so why try to connect the two terms so desperately? because Intelligence to you just means some sort of mental competence?,0.7396,81

"Emotional intelligence isn't worthless, but compared to IQ it does not give you an accurate representation of how successful you will be later in life. The reason why emotional intelligence is bullshit is because in the cases where we need innovation, or brand new concepts that save hundreds of millions of lives the act of sympathy or understanding is worthless. Understanding someones emotions did not create the Polio vaccine. Society isn't wrong in assuming that emotional intelligence is inferior to IQ, well at least unless you are one of the plebs that gets angry about the IQ vs EI while using a device that was created by a genius.

"It is ironic that most people don't realize that the majority of highly intelligent people don't have this egotism and lack of emotional understanding. Yes many are introverted but those who understand a good deal of science have a high understanding of emotions as well. Empathy is rather important because it is one of the major ways in which we learn seeing ourselves in others and being able to copy them. It is how you're also able to develop and imagine futuristic scenarios its why you can predict the moves of an opponent you know well. It is why the majority of scientist have more often worked to help people rather than ever get rich. Key examples are of course Pasteur who developed penicillin, Tesla who created well the basis for all electrical gadgets but died poor whilst trying to help communities, Salk who never took out a patent for the cure to polio asking what could you patent the sun?, Einstein who was constantly working to heighten peoples awareness on global issues. The issue is that the egocentric Scientist is more of a myth people have made to compensate for their own inadequacies desiring power in the form of knowledge. Scientist are more, well preachy than they are cruel or vindictive. After all we know from the majority of tests and history that ignorance far more begets pride and arogance than knowledge",0.903,246

She appears briefly in Rick's memory when he's being probed by evil Morty's robot Rick & again in Rick's fake backstory.
