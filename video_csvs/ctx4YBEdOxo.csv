1. the acceleration is so hard it can crush your ribs just merely with the G-force that comes with it.
2. it comes in 3 colors, 'red', 'fast red' and 'holy mother of god that's fast red'
3. if you drive the car from America to Australia, at its top speed, then you can stay in the same time while moving from one time zone to another.
4. if you fire a AK-47 bullet parallel to this car while its driving at its top speed, there is a good chance, the driver of the car can see the bullet moving along side the car while that bullet overtakes the car.
5. if there is a laser pointer in front of the car which points exactly longitudinally to the car, and if you press the pointer button of the laser and floor the car simultaneously, the the first beam coming out of the laser WILL JUMP to different dimension out of the sheer acceleration that is a result of the car's acceleration and light speed multiplication.",0.7926,206

We also went to Thermal efficiencies and disposal/recycling of the cobalt inside batteries which he said only some of it can be extracted and I found out that it could be extracted at 99.5%, I can understand why you wouldn't give a shit about the planet but don't go putting down something that can benefit us greatly in the future and for those of us who have  foresight longer than the next football game and prefer our cities not to smell like shit.",0.952,247

Is the roadster fast?
Yes , on a drag strip not on the track 
Obviously on the track the driver is going to play a bigger role but again the top speed for the roadster is 250 (not limited) and the challenger demon is 168 limited but you can unlock it with a PCM you get with the demon crate which also allows you to use 104 octane gas

"If this is coming out in 2020 then other Hyper Cars will have caught up with it in terms of acceleration and some have already beaten it in top speed. Plus, you can‚Äôt judge a car purely by those statistic for example it doesn‚Äôt have a spoiler and with that kind of speed your going to have no grip in the corners so the handling will probably be pretty poor.

Sure you can get a few accelerations, but there is no engine screaming, no enjoyment of shifting through the gears. Even if it was 50k I would still save to buy a Lamborghini over this. Its a great car, its just nothing compared to supercars, because supercars are about drama and the Tesla really doesnt have any. You might as well just be driving a P100D.",0.8733,165

And I will prove to myself and wife that I can survive without clicking on the big RESERVE button. Push comes to shove buy yourself a CPO Tesla. 

Was looking at the site a couple of days ago and in the New England section was a MS built in 2012 under 1300 serial number. Not even close compared to what Tesla is building today but still a car to rock people who ride with you. Something to add to your garage for under $51 K. And when you really want to blow someone's mind or clear your own pull the 2012  MS out for a cruise to bring yourself back to the early days which if you remember were good enough to blow everybody's mind in the automotive world. 

I'm retired and as much as I would love to own a MS but unless I hit the lottery, it just isn't going to happen.

Enjoyed your video but even with a gas powered super car there just isn't anyplace in the United States where you could drive a super car or Roadster 2.0 4 seater to the point where you wouldn't endanger yourself or someone else. Though I have to admit it would be fun to see the pilots eyes on a Boeing 747-8 arch up when the New Roadster zooms by the 747-8 on takeoff just as the aircraft reaches say 150 mph which is liftoff speed on a 10,000 footer runway so the car would have roughly 3000 feet to slow down and stop before it ran out of runway. 
Better yet equip a MS with the 200 KW battery and three traction motor drive system and offer say a 5 car fleet so equipped to the Nevada Highway Patrol to try out. Still with the present 155 mph speed limit.

Kindly forgive me as I'm dreaming a bit but the technology in the new roadster has real world applications in law enforcement on the interstate highway system.

Enjoy and remember the prayer at the beginning of this post.",0.9945,391
