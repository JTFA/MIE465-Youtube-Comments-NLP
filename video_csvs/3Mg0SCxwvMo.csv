"Also, if i understood you correctly, you are in trastevere, right? Go to Chiesa Rettoria di Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. It is a church, yes, but wait, stay with me. It is not a typical church. Go inside and then on the left buy an entry to the underground section of the church(it is only 3 or 5 euros) and then go down. The church above is built over a house from 3. century in which early romans used to secretly gather and worship. I don't want to tell you too much so i don't spoil the surprise, but if you keep on walking once you went downstairs, you will see one of my personal favourite places in rome. It is stunningly beautiful and hardly any tourists ever go there.
Also, once you are done visiting the downstairs area, at the ""ticket office"" you can buy one of those cute pillows stuffed with lavander that the nuns make... It will keep your closet smelling nice :)",0.9645,191
"And one last thing, i promise: for sweets, try Pasticceria Boccione. It is in the jewish part of the city.

But despite all of it, one feels welcome and part of the neighbourhood :)
And for a light, yet creamy tiramisu, try Carlo Menta. Food there is, in general, unmemorable, but the handmade tiramisu they have is really really nice. It is creamy, but not overwhelmingly so, and it feels very light.",0.9506,138

But its been years and i practiced my song and a monologue i struggled to grasp. I went to auditions and it was packed, people were practicing and they oozed skill from years of practice. I got intimidated and didnt sign up. And a fit of anxiety hit me and i could not stop my eyes from crying. Ive been feeling bad that i put so much effort and when it came down to it i wasent able to make the last step. Then i remember you both and building a ladder.

"William Chen I know the odds of you seeing my comment are slim but in case you do my greatest advice to anyone becoming a teacher is to try to get to know your students and to show them you care. I work at a local high school and a good amount of the students come from rougher backgrounds, they may not have really great examples and/or a lot of support in their lives so I consider it part of my job to be a good example and to help them be successful not only as a student but as a person. I tell people that I love my students even when they're driving me crazy and boy do they drive me crazy sometimes but my greatest joy comes when they come and tell me about how they did better on a test than they thought they would or how they got into a college they've been working towards. It may seem hard but any extra time you can take to help a student with homework, go over an application, or go to a school concert or sporting event when a student asks you will make such a difference. One of my most rewarding experiences was seeing the face of a student who had invited me to the band concert light up when he saw that I actually showed up. I think it's so important to build a ladder when teacher, stockpile your good experiences because you will have bad days and you may have days that will shake you but stay strong and don't give up. Good luck!",0.9959,282
