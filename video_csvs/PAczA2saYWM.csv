The actors really like you and you make them feel comfortable in a really fucking vulnerable time. They have no comfort zone after Da Bomb blows there tongues off yet you reel em back from the edge so smoothly. I am going on, but I love  you, the show and it is part of my nightly YouTube wormhole routine. I am not a spicy foods person which is why I feel like such a voyeur watching something dirty.

"Today was a day that lived in ""infamy"" from where I stand.  You're talking about blinking for fun, I'm talking about blinking for ""LIFE.""  All day, every day, in this society, everyone seems to hate cops.  I get some of it, I understand they are the ""party poopers,"" but what about REAL LIFE?  What happens when your police sacrifice their lives to protect everyone?  And then the cop dies?  No one celebrates that!  They celebrate some person that played a dad on a show on TV.  They pretend cops are the worst people on Earth.  If that were the case, why would three men rush in and have their ""cream of the crop"" first responder, who served in two terms on the war,  die instantly, and get NOTHING like an invite to this show?  Or any show?  Why do people automatically assume cops are bad?  

I challenge this show to stand up for the blue team at one point.  Please celebrate LEO's.  Do anything you can to raise awareness.  We're not all bad guys!  But we lose people every day, even in small little towns where NOTHING is supposed to ""happen.""  In the last 7 months we've lost two cops to idiot criminals.  Let's try to raise some awareness for the boys in blue.  You break the law, WE DIE.  Honor someone, anyone.  Any state.  Just do it.

Protip:  We're not all white.#BLM right?",-0.9722,284

Everyone hates it, and it seems (based on guest reactions) that it's not made to have any real flavor, just pure burn factor.

"With 4,000 comments, I'm sure this isn't going to get ready by Sean or any of the FWF staff, but considering the disdain Sean expresses for the Da Bomb hot sauce in this video, but the reactions the guests have to it, I would suggest something like PuckerButt Reaper Squeezins.  I have just come across it rather recently and I've never experienced such a quick punch of heat from a sauce... and the sauce is incredibly hot, albeit with great flavor.  I don't know where it would sit on the Scoville scale, though, so it may heavily outweigh Da Bomb in terms of overall heat.",-0.3506,116
