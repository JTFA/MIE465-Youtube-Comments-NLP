Oh, more things: I would suggest a fan somewhere to purge the exposure area from smoke that can affect the laser dot quality. In directed-energy-on-powderbed 3D printing processes, not only is a purge like that used, the toolpath generation even takes the gas flow direction into account so as to not direct the beam through the fume clouds that are on their way out across the yet unexposed powder surface!
Also, instead of obsessively trying to force blocks of metal around just to redirect a weightless laser beam, and taking painstaking and costly (if amazing and innovative) efforts to reduce mechanical trouble, have you ever considered galvos? https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=galvo, https://www.amazon.de/Others-Seeedstudio-Galvanometer-motor-SC17-15K/dp/B0711XGSDG In fact, you could even combine 2D gantries with galvoed laser to increase exposure speed by using the gantry movement for rough X/Y scanning letting the galvos do the fine work. That way you could drastically reduce, even eliminate vibration from actuating heavy equipment (because you could simply let the print head travel at constant speed) while still achieving fantastic accuracy and resolution without sacrificing build space dimensions!

Thanks Laser Graffiti for posting the URL link.,0.4404,9
Thanks for sharing 😀👍,0.6908,5
"Thanks for the reply, although I am already following Tom's videos. His video was actually the reason I now need to have the TMC2130 on my Prusa :D The issue is that the Rambo Mini has very few unused PINs. Having four TMC2130 will make the multi material upgrade unusable. I guess having only X and Y is the best tradeoff.

Just received the parcel from Watterott, so hopefully I will be able to do a quick and dirty proof of concept tomorrow (using P3 header and changing the PINs in the firmware). Today I have to install the beamer and screen :)",0.9405,114
Thanks for the video very interesting!show us what software you use to get from Gerber or image to Lasered copper?,0.4926,23
Thanks!,0.4926,2
"Thanks! I don't have printer, so I have to find someone to do it.  (Or load STL into something, get dimensions, and start filing!)",0.5399,32
"That idea really reminded me of Microsculpture https://petapixel.com/2016/04/25/macro-photos-made-10k-images-captured-microscope-lens/  
Thematically a bit off but maybe some of you find it interesting.",0.5499,21

That led at the end tho........................BTW was that the MACRO REPS logo on the chip (at 2:48 ) ??? you sneaky beautiful bastard!,-0.3252,29

The Trinamic drivers were probably the best upgrade for my 3D printer - Delta printers are especially noisy with four motors going constantly; now all I hear is the fan noise,0.6712,32

"The oscilloscope outputs at 4:43 from your drivers are exactly the same as a ""class a"" audio amplifier (or likely ""class ab"" on the left) vs a ""class b"" audio amplifier (on the right). The cross over distortion (or in the audio world THD) likely influences stepper driver movement in the same way as it does a speaker driver or our ears. Hence being more quiet and having fewer artifacts.",0.0,85
The white ones? Looking very much identical ... but if you want to be 100% sure you should check the datasheets,0.5267,23
This is a fantastic video. I'm looking forward to seeing how all of this is done and how to configure it. I just bought this same machine and am following your upgrade path. Please put a configuration video with information on how to do it!,0.7345,49
This is awesome,0.6249,3

"Those definitely look like missed steps to me. Notice how some of the boxes are either not closed, or have ""legs"" where the laser closed the box shorter than where it began engraving. These plagued my A5 Pro. I had to re-square the frame, added some 3D-printed axle spacers (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2501088), the belt tensioners featured in this video, and fiddled with the acceleration to sort it all out.",0.2732,81
"Unfortunately sold out now at Watterott - I was thinking about buying them before, but now knowing how incredibly silent they are, you convinced me.
Though it seems that's the only store you can get those at in Germany, sadly",-0.2144,44
Very interesting video. Everything ordered and printed justness to wait for the deliveries now.,0.4576,16
"Very nice.  Quick question.  On many of these laser diodes, they specify not to run the laser for more than 30 minutes continuous.  Is this just a matter of better cooling to improve the duty cycle, or is the duty limit inherent to the diodes?  Thanks",0.8977,52

"Well err, not quite a legit comparison. Speakers are essentially (ideally) a resistive load being driven by a voltage source (Class AB or Class D). Steppers have a significantly greater inductive component and are being driven by a current source. The feedback loop in an audio amp is controlling the amps voltage output whereas the stepper driver feedback is controlling the current that the stepper coil is allowed to ramp up to. If the scope is showing only voltage across the stepper coil then that's not the whole story....",0.5574,99

Yeah those trinamics are a beast of an IC,0.296,9
"Yeah, the TMC2130 is great. Got some on the way, too. Now I just have to figure out a way to install them on the Prusa MK2... Maybe your Arduino-Code can help me with that?!",0.8516,43
"Yeh, beautiful idea! I already have nice ""h264 built-in"" camera that gets huge resolutions at high frame rates through USB 2.0. Will take a look at that lens.",0.8516,34
"Yes, I've noticed that too. I think it's a result of a relatively new GRBL feature that adjusts laser PWM power based on movement speed. When the axis moves slower, the power is reduced to avoid burning. Since I have adjusted the laser power to a level that just barely exposes Bungard FR4 boards, I could imagine that the GRBL-side adjustment causes insufficient exposure",0.0754,70
"Yes, sense resistor and active differential probe to avoid triggering the short-to-ground-protection",0.4939,13
"Yes, the new Prusa i3 mk3 that just came out uses the same drivers for sound and also for endstop detection.",0.4019,23
You can turn that GRBL feature off if you use M3 to enable the laser. Use M4 to enable the dynamic power mode which has its uses but probably not in PCB work.,0.2023,35
"You never want springy tensioners for precision movements. That kinda defeats the purpose. They have to move reliably and precisely, and springs make corners round :)",0.3479,29

Zhang Wu I never had any problems. For some cheaper products I had to pay taxes and customs but not this laser machine. That came right to my door without having been opened for inspection.,0.1101,38
any idea what the kerf on that laser is.. because im wondering whats the smallest smd foot print i cant get away with.. if it could do a 48qfp microcontroller that has 0.21mm space between each pin i would totally go for this machine,0.0,47
