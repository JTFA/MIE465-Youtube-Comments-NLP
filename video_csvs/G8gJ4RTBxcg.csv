"Can't exactly see it, but what part did the crab precisely attack? Can't see him piercing the chest, or something. Or is it possible that the bird just blacked out and went into shock from the pain and intrusion of the claw grabbing it?",-0.924,49

"Do they though? Coconut crabs in GENERAL were just thought to be scavengers; that would imply that NO ONE has seen this behaviour ""all the time"" otherwise why would the general consensus be that they don't hunt?",-0.5095,42
"Ghostlore yeah precisely,
Interesting nonetheless.

I think it's only reasonable to assume that any animal, is opportunistic, i mean if an opportunity presents itself, it's only natural to act on it.

I hear the coconut crabs attack when the birds are sleeping...,-0.4767,12
"I""m thinking this was an extremely lucky/opportunistic catch. Those crabs don't appear to be very fast. Since it is night time in the video, I'm guessing the crab caught the bird sleeping.
I also think there are many animal behaviors that we have yet to discover, e.g. they recently discovered that deer will eat birds etc.
Pretty cool video if you're not a bird lover :)",-0.0134,79

If catfish can sneak up on pigeons on the shoreline and eat them whole then I'm willing to believe a seagull is dumb enough to get caught by a crab claw in the dark.,-0.5106,35
"If you saw the Newsweek article that led many of us here, you may have noticed the bit where it said that some scientists speculate that coconut crabs could eat a dead or <i>dying</i> human. So imagine you're lying on the jungle floor, unconscious, or conscious but too injured to move. Along come some of these coconut crabs, probably at night in the dark, and they break your fucking arms with those claws, and then start chowing down on you. Most unpleasant!",-0.9248,94

"Joan Granberg Sorry, I worded my reply wrong, I think all they are claiming is this is the first time it has been observed and until now we didn’t think coconut crabs were able to do this. 
In other words, I’m in agreement of your assessment of reality, just that my comprehension of the text was not implying it was a newly “adapted” behaviour.",-0.0516,76

Just say the pounds. Why would you put 3300 newtons. You faggot.,-0.6597,15

No one has a frame of reference for units of force in newtons. They did it to be different not because it came naturally to the person making the video.,-0.296,32

"The ""New Scientist"" article describes the stalking and killing of the bird more thoroughly than this video.
The crab climbed the tree and attacked the sleeping bird first then climb back down to the ground after it broke one of the bird's wings.  Also Other crabs came and ate the bird.
No human intervention except to film the event.",-0.9081,65
"The coconut crab easily breaks open coconut shells to get at the meat inside. Hence their name. Those claws generate 30,000 newtons of force. That's about 3.37 tons, more than enough to snap off a human arm.",0.34,42
The noises the bird made were disturbing,-0.5106,7
This is terrifying. Lock your doors and close your windows people!,-0.6114,13
This was staged by the sadistic man filming this BS event. He caught the bird and sadistically put it in the crabs claws. These crabs move very very slow and only thing they can pick their claws up highj enough are to eat dead objects or coconuts. May this person be damned!,-0.8016,56

"Wicked Mouse: 3,300 newtons is their max (Thirty-Three Hundred). NOT 30,000 newtons. LoL, that much pressure out of ligaments no bigger than the biggest ones running down your forearms would make it the strongest material known to man BY FAR.

 3300 Newton (N) = 741.86951 Pound Force (lbf) = 3.3 Kilonewton = 336.50635 Kilogram Force 


          Not trying to be a jerk, but your forces were a teeny bit off. 741lbf on such a small surface area is MORE than enough to hurt, and given time, more than enough to tear, destroy, remove, and pulverize flesh, muscle, and ligaments of all but the fittest of human beings.",-0.9118,129
