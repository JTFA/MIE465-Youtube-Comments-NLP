"Hi Emmy. You have mislabeled rations. In the order you opened them they translate as supper, dinner and breakfast. Reason is that Russians call 1-2pm meal dinner and it is the largest meal of the day. Also you should not heat zucchini caviar. It is eaten cold as say guacamole with crackers. Also the ""meat soup"" is in fact ""tushenka"" or meat ragu. It is eaten with unmolten white fat on crackers - sort of like shmear or German shmalz. It was fun watching you trying make sense of it all. Cheers!",0.8359,108

In 90s we gave up our nuclear arsenal, and really bordering with countries like Russia and China with only 18 mln it's kinda stupid to think about war and fighting. We want to be neutral like other neutral countries. We even don't have a mandatory army service. I even don't know in what cases people use these military rations because it's not needed.
