I've been searching up and down their site and I can't find any of these jackets. Is it possible if you can please provide the exact links?,0.3182,29
"I've seen other YouTubers make way more sponsored videos than Jenn does, and I trust that she filters out brands that she doesn't believe in and only go for ones that she's really into. I really don't mind sponsored videos so long as the content is true to Jenn's style, and this one is. Plus, for Clinique or Simple Skincare, she does try to be creative with her content, which I appreciate. That said, I do feel that this video is a tad ""sponsor-heavy"" because Nordstorm Rack's channel is mentioned 3 times, which feels ad-y for me. Maybe that's one of the terms mentioned by the brand, we'll never know. Still, I can see Jenn works hard for her videos, so kudos to her. Thanks for continuously churning out quality content, Jenn :)",0.9659,152

"Jenn is the title of the video right? It's just that you've ALWAYS written ""how I style"" and not ""how TO style"". I figured it was because you believe that there's no right way to style anything, that people should wear whatever feels right for them. That's why I found it quite strange to see it writen with the ""to""...",-0.5095,71

She could then at least say in the video or description that these pieces are older and no longer available. Miss Louie is a great fashion Youtuber as well and she even goes a step further and will find similar items that are currently available at the time the video is uploaded. It's just about being considerate of your viewers- Jen's style is great but this is not the first lookbook that has been dismissive to her audience when the outfits miss the mark or are not accessible to her viewers.,0.6597,95

"The thing I don't understand is what is so wrong with sponsored videos?? Why the backlash? The look book is still great, the styling is till great and on the brighter side (it should be the brighter side), Jenn earns which helps her continue to make videos and contents. This in turn feeds us and we enjoy them. Hence, it is a win win situation for all. Why can't people just be happy for other people??",0.9808,89
"There's people complaining about the video being sponsored while I think the video is well done. Personally, I'm always happy/proud to see my favorite youtubers get some sweet sponsorships as a reward of them doing well. Especially since youtube adsense is ridiculous nowadays. Really loved the video Jenn, the first outfit must be my favorite ^_^",0.9501,65
