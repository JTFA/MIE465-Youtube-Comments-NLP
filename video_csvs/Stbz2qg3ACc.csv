A band likely did the music and actors did the visual. To be honest the actors really didn't do good job at all. I'm not trying to be mean at all but if you ever decide to do percussion don't follow this example. Sorry not trying to be rude but just a friendly heads up!,0.1172,59

I think the music sounds great! They probably used a professional band. But the percussionists on screen are obviously actors. I don't mean that in a bad way but it is slightly embarrassing to the percussion community. I definitely would've appreciated the commercial more if they used a real drumline or someone to teach them proper technique.,0.7671,62

Verizon treated us so bad they likely lost a customer for life.  They love to get you into their contracts and then charge a $200 cancellation fee.  This is what they did to us.  Learn what customer service is Verizon because you have none.  Any place that makes you sign a contract for their services very likely gives crap service to their customers.  Why else would they lock you into a contract for their cellular phone?,-0.6657,83
