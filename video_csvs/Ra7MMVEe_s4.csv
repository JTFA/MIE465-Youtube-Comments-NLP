"1:25- VERY powerful moment. This entire video is amazing. The fact that this was set way back in the day makes it even more significant. You LOVE who you LOVE. This video gives the song a whole new meaning! Just a few months earlier, this Norwegian singer Sophia Elise received death threats for pulling a similar stunt. Let’s hope Hunter can express his socially progressive views without the hate!",0.9678,79

"Black guy and a white girl, this is political pandering and has the exact opposite effect of what you want. Why didn’t you go for a black girl and a white guy? See the problem here? You’re not being progressive, you’re just pissing people off because we are now forced to look at the race of people instead of at the content of their character. So now you have to make a video like this to “prove“ that you’re not a racist because you are assumed to be one because you are a white man. This is why identity politics is evil. It makes everybody do stupid things.",-0.8895,127

"Dear friends Jesus Christ is ALWAYS WITH YOU! Upon accepting this truth, these 3 words will become like a safety net for you, protecting you from falling into despair. Because we are human, we will always have ups and downs in our life experiences. But the promise of the Presence of our Lord and Savior limits how far down we can go. Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down. Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. Dear ones, not only is Jesus with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory. All you have to do is say YES to Him this very moment and receive the promises of his unfathomable love. ❤️❤️❤️ (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9897,236
