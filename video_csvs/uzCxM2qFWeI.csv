"Happy New Year Lucie.  Love your videos.  I will say (and I do this too), studies say using your phone before bed is the worst for a good nights' sleep.  I am guilty of doing this too as I am a casting director here in NYC and own my own business so I am 24/7 with emailing.  Anyway...seems like a ton of stuff you do after work...my favorite is your walking daily...I used to do that and you have inspired me to do revisit this very decompressing activity after work.  Manhattan is simply the best for this ritual.  Most importantly (sort of...ha ha)...WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME OF THE CHARCOAL TEETH WHITENING EXPERIMENT?!?!  I was so curious when you mentioned it would take a few weeks and then you would let us know your verdict on this trend.  Thanks Lucie-you work very hard and it shows.",0.9779,173
