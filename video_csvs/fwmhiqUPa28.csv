"J.J. Abrams and Bad Robot... Does this mean that the Stephen King multiverse is part of the Cloververse? In all seriousness, as much as I‚Äôm a fan of Cloverfield and hoping they would improve after The Cloverfield Paradox, with the few details that I saw of Stephen King‚Äôs connected books, I feel that _that‚Äôs_ how the Cloververse _should‚Äôve_ been executed (you know, aside from making their _own_ original scripts). They said recently that they wanted to go for a semi-anthology angle with Cloverfield with little connections in the films and ARGs, but if they want to go that route, I think they should‚Äôve used the connections as little easter eggs and references that only the hardcore fans would notice (like with the Tagruato branded tanker in the first film and the Bold Futura document in the second), or present them in a way that won‚Äôt confuse and alienate casual audiences. They shouldn‚Äôt put ‚ÄúCloverfield,‚Äù in the title of _every_ film so that way they wouldn‚Äôt confuse casual audiences and give them the unintended expectations. The Cloverfield title should be saved for the special, crossover films that connects them all (basically, their own equivalent to The Dark Tower). If they did that, casual audiences won‚Äôt be as confused and pissed like they are now.",0.8442,260
