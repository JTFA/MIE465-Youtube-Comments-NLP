1. My book is called 'Meet Cute'
2. It doesn't have a release date because I'm relying on you, kind Nerdfighters, to nominate it for publication
3. It is available for nomination on Kindle Scout:https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=3KRKL8BRA5K9I&K=1KCBPBEBB5F9N&M=urn:rtn:msg:20180131050614edc9b9400ab4499da2f6511070c0p0na&R=AE1GOXQM139Z&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fkindlescout.amazon.com%2Fp%2F3JASBEV7IHB8T%3Fref_%3Dpe_886810_126055510&H=JRZKYSWLTLOK54YYAG8V39IXVSIA&ref_=pe_886810_126055510
Please, if you like the sound of a YA romance following five couples' love stories from 'meet cute' to 'happily ever after' nominate it for publication. And if you aren't into clicking on random links, I know I'm not, you can always go to the Kindle Scout main page and search 'meet cute.' Thanks, Nerdfighters! DFTBA! Also, hi John!

"John, here's the thing: Hank's approach made him come across as a person who made a thing and is excited to share that thing. The promotional approach you took in this video, made you come across as a capitalist shill simply trying to sell something. What I despise most about capitalism is how it devalues the actual things that matter by focusing on the artificial value of money, commerce, and prestige. When you ""commercially promote"" something, the focus is on getting people to buy it, and the focus is not on the desire to share something that you personally want to share.

This has been something that Vlogbrothers has shifted toward in too great a capacity over the years, in my opinion. Moving from a high genuine human factor, to a greater and greater capitalist one, more concerned with what there is majority demand for, than in simply sharing what you value and want to share.",0.9721,175

Wow. WOW. What a brilliant podcast. I didn't really know what to expect going in, I mean surely a podcast about birds and soda can't be that interesting? But it's about so much more than that. It's so poetic and beautifully written. Fans of John Green's novels will feel like they're getting new Green short stories with every episode. It's also informative in a way that makes me fascinated in learning about topics that seem, on the surface, to be mundane. My only critique: I enjoyed John's ""reading voice"" and thought it was a nice contrast to the more upbeat tone of the brothers' other podcast Dear Hank and John, but on a more sleep deprived day his soothing monotone voice might lull me to sleep. Thank you John for this amazing addition to my commute. Thank you for everything, really.",0.9819,182

She has to solve the mystery, balance relationships, deal with the pressure of being in the public eye, and fight for what she thinks is right all at the same time and it is not healthy."").
