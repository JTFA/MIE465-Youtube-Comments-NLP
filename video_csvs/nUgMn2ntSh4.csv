"So I know you will probably skip this one but. I am so passionate about it and people should know about it. Disc golf or (frisbee golf) is one of the fastest growing sports you have never heard of. Lots of people actually do it as a full time job. Their is so much more than meets the eye with frisbee golf. Just watching one video you can see how amazing it is. It would be incredible to see you try this inexpensive and beautiful sport. Not only to grow your knowledge on it, but others too.",0.9668,108

"Thanks so much for watching!!! I want to point out, as I did in a comment below, that this video was shot and programmed before any news of Nassar and USA Gymnastics Team surfaced. I, and all of my colleagues at Refinery29, of course stand behind the courageous survivors who did and didn't speak out about their horrific experiences with that man. This video is meant to be an inside look at the incredible sport and the amazing women (like Anya!) who work so hard to be able to accomplish these incredible physical feats! Lemme know what other Lucie for Hire episodes you want to see me try!! This one was tough, but ultimately so much fun!! xx
