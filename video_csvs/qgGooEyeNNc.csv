I also liked Chester Bennington, but he died for a special reason: he wanted to kill himself. Chester Bennington = Life!",-0.8242,78

"No professional musician in this video looks truly sad. It's no wonder Chester offed himself.

Nah...we all know he's alive. He just bailed on the industry cuz fame was too much.

Seriously, tho...these pros could act a little better. Heck, Trump and Warren both seem more genuine than these brats.",0.4228,62
Nobody can match Chester with vocals. it is almost embarrassing to watch these other artists sing his songs.,-0.3197,20
"Nobody comes close, to the Level, Skill and Talent Chester brought to Linkin Park. It was disturbing and almost disrespectful to have these other Artists attempt to sing these Songs. I am confused at how this is remembering and embracing his Voice. These others destroyed these songs and  managed to do it off key and out of tune while performing them. They should have had Chester singing from recordings while the band played live. I only watched a few minutes of this and cringed the whole entire time. Not any random Music Artist can sing these songs.....if they find another lead singer.... They need to try to match Chester in sound and tone. Actually, Adam Lambert would be able to pull it off I feel. He has the range and sound, he would just have to bring up the Intensity to match and balance.",-0.5574,160
"Nobody compares to Chester with Vocals, Skill and Talent. it is actually irritating to see these other artists Butcher and seeing his songs so incredibly bad and off-key. I think it would have been more appropriate to have recordings of Chester singing the songs as they played live. It does not give Chester or Linkin Park the proper respect the way this concert was performed. I only saw this video and cringed the whole way through.",0.0589,82
