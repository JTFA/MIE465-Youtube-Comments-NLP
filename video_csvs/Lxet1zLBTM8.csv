"Guys please help me ! 
My HTC One E8 battery is dead and I am thinking of buying a new phone but I'm confused between HTC 10 and OnePlus 5T.
(I love my old phone, I have used it since 2014 and so I trust HTC's quality)

HTC 10 -
Costs 400 USD in India (Cheaper than the 5T).
Now it may be a little dated, but it was a flagship when it came out, so I am sure the build will be top notch.
But I fear that the new android updates might slow down the phone and its already been 2 years since it came out.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OnePlus 5T -
Costs 492 USD.
All the reviews say its a very good phone, but personally I haven't ever used a OnePlus phone, so I am not sure how good it is in the long run. (I don't like to upgrade my phone every year)

Please help me to choose guys ! Thanks in advance !",0.9872,185

1) Turn the phone around so that video camera is recording phone's back side.

[table mirror] <---- [phone front]|[phone back] <---- [video recorder|You].
