Kudos for this commercial! The message was amazing and I want you to know it inspired my 6 year old daughter.  She watched this 5 times and then she couldn't wait to show her dad the clip when he got home from work.  After seeing this she asked to start gymnastics again.  Our daughter was born with a condition called congenital femoral deficiency.  She's had 4 surgeries and another big one planned in May which will leave her unable to walk for 6 months. She has come across obstacles that have caused problems but we always find a way to overcome it.  We've always told her she can do anything she wants as long as she sets her mind to do it.  This commercial sent that exact message!  Go start your impossible! Thank you.,0.8007,145
