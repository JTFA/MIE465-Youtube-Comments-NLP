"Dear friends Jesus Christ loves you so much. Please put Him above all things because He IS above all things. This includes your problems, your pain, and the swirling events of this everchanging world. When you behold the Presence of Jesus Christ, you rise above circumstances and rest with Him in heavenly realms. This is the way to Peace, living in the light of our Lord. I guarantee you will always have problems in this life but they must not become your focus. When you feel yourself sinking in the sea of circumstances, say ""Help me, Jesus!"" and He WILL draw you back to Him. If you have to say it thousands of times daily, don't be discouraged. Jesus knows your weakness and He WILL meet you right there in that very place. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Romans 8:39; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.8562,197

"Take a hit, shoot me down, shoot me down
I will never hit the ground, hit the ground
Playing dead, I'll never do
Gotta keep an eye on you
Patience is wearing thin, paper thin
Promises broke again, what a sin
But it only feeds my energy
So don't expect no sympathy

Smoke, fire, it's all going up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood
Smoke, fire, flares are going up, flares are going up

Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
Oh, I won't go down slow
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Put an X on my chest, on my chest
But I'm still standing cause I won't forget
The hell on earth you put me through
I'll save myself in spite of you

Smoke, fire, it's all going up
Don't you know I ain't afraid to shed a little blood
Smoke, fire, flares are going up, flares are going up

Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
This time I won't let go
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
Oh, I won't go down slow
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

White flag never going up, never going up, no, no
White flag never going up, never going up, no, no
White flag never going up, never going up, no, no

Oh, won't wave my white flag, no
(Wave my white flag)
This time I won't let go
(Won't let go)
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight
Won't wave my white flag, no
(Wave my white flag)
Oh, I won't go down slow
(Go down slow)
I'd rather die
Than give up the fight, give up the fight
