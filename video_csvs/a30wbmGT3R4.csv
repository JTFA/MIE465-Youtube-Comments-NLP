madboyreadynow28 I must say I do appreciate your spin on this situation. I find it both interesting and refreshing to hear a different point of view. You do have good points about living your life and achieving your goals with children. It can be more difficult with the extra responresponsibility while having a career. In a loving relationships where both agree then why wait until middle age? You can have your cake and eat it too if that is your plan.,0.8981,88
madboyreadynow28 The problem with your comment is what you think Angela should be doing and what she wants to do is different.

"this is my issue. You  don't know the discrimination women...esp pregnant/women with kids face in the workplace. Also...you don't  carry the child for 9 months, or breastfeed for 2 years. 

Thirdly, who was with your kids while you were achieving?  It would have to be their mother.
