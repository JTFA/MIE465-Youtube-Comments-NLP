Mm UN speech said that the Nickelodeon show came to her house to cover  her story and a month later procter and gamble changed the tagline from women to people. But inside edition reported that she got the invite bcoz she was successful in changing the slogan of the said product. And why is it that mm slogan is different from the slogan of the same product.

And i think it is lousy comm""l  that couldn""t attract a person to buy the product bcoz of those women throwing their gloves outside the windows. Perhaps it means either, the women don""t need the gloves to clean those greasy pots and pans bcoz ivory dishwashing liquid would do the cleaning { w/c was a total nonsense} or those women gone mad bc the product  could not remove the dirts. Or was there other reason that i don""t know? And why did the parts where the two words Women {w/ an x} and people was removed?

Un speech of mm {w/c i think has been deleted} told us that she was w/ her schoolmates in a classroom watching tv, just watching tv when ivory dishwashing liquid appeared while now just read the above article, it already included  social studies assignement.
