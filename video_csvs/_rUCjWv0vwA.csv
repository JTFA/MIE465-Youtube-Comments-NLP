"Her hair is a bit too long and fine for this. Someone with short curly hair could make this work.
Also I did something like this years ago. My natural color i blond but i dye it black. Once i dyed my light roots red just to see the results. The only thing I liked about it was that when you ran your finger throuhg my hair you could see the red appear and dissapear.",0.765,81

It's Tabaitha  it will fade fast. A good rule of thumb with dye is to dye it darker than you want. It only stays that dark for like a week,0.6908,32
It's gonna look REAL WEIRD when her natural roots start growing lol,0.5525,12

Nope. Terrible. I hope she didn't tip the person who did that to her. Shadow roots are not pink.  Dreadful.,0.2973,25
