Andre Williams no bortles is obviously not better and you are correct completion percentage isn't everything. That was just one example that i decided to use but there are many more. It's just my own opinion tbh. I know there are alot of ppl who consider cam a great QB but not me. I respect your thoughts and opinions but i also have my own and i personally don't think he's as good as people say he is.

So what? Where is your football IQ? Cam is the running back and the Quaterback of the offense.  If completion percentage matters so much to you Bortles would be considered better than Cam Newton.
