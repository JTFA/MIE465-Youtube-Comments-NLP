Thank you for that. :) My holy grail product is the Radiant Glow Facial Oil from Derma-E, it is so great for a glowing finish and leaves your face feeling really smooth and soft. I use it twice a day, just two drops after my essence. It is vegan and crusty free as well, so  that's another thing to love, as well as it is very affordable and lasts a good amount of time. It also looks super cool, it literally looks like liquid gold, though I do recommend shaking it up well before each use as it has mica in it and the mica tends to collect on the bottom. :)",0.9946,147
