"Are they talking about the franco stuff with all those texts and instagram dm's? Because that happened a couple years ago and everyone laughed about it back then. It was the same thing with louis ck, no one cared a couple years ago about the allegations about him, but in today's climate we suddenly care. Now wacking it in front of a bunch of girls is much worse than what franco did but still. It bothers me that with a lot of these stories that are coming out were treated as non stories a few years ago but now all the sudden we care and act like its new. Everyone's a hypocrite.",0.8316,120
"As a gay man in West Hollywood, I have heard tons of stuff, I tend to keep quiet even though I know about quite a few friends who have been part of things that happened. If it is this, then just like anyone else he needs to own up. Gay or Straight, unwanted sexual advances are not cool, and damaging in many ways to some of the people involved, not all, I know some of my friends who have laughed things off and aren't bothered, be it from him or anyone else's advances, but for others, it's a big deal. So, I can't say what this is about but whatever it is, it will come out eventually. We are living in a world where nothing stays behind closed doors. Not with social media and phones that can take pics and videos. None of us really know what has transpired. Only those who were involved know. I also want to state this regarding underage sex. There is a huge difference if the person is 17 or if the person is 10 or 14 for example. I don't know anyone who hasn't had sex by 17, and yes, by law it's different, but let us not call someone a pedophile unless the term is warranted, many 17 year olds lie about their age to have sex and drink etc etc. I have never heard of Bryan Singer being involved with anyone young. So no one should really say anything unless there is 100% proof of things. But I have heard a lot of stuff where if true, it will come out and he will be no different to those others being named now. If only this could apply to the Alabama guy and our President, sheesh..... The only thing I would caution Rocha is to please say allegedly when talking about rumors and other things unless it has been proven. It protects him and Collider.

And yes, in regards to who to take over. If the cinematographer has been doing a great job stepping in and he wants to direct the rest of it, why not? That's how people move from one category to another. This might be an amazing opportunity for this person!",0.9894,414

Like they're constantly saying, many more people were involved in making the stuff and, whatever I think of the real person, I can still enjoy their character. If we really took it seriously, there's probably not a single thing we could ever watch again. I still like Parks and Rec, Seinfeld, X2, Baby Driver, Naked Gun, etc., etc. There's real people in them that I don't like, but I still like the work done. Just don't let them do any more work.

      Jessica Chastain likes to shoot her mouth off about a lot of things so her take on anything carries zero weight. I think Singer needs to take a break because his work since Supes Returns has been stale. I didn‚Äôt buy into rumors or she said he said because people lie, everyone lies so to unilaterally take a side on something you don‚Äôt personally know specifics is just sloppy.

I‚Äôm not a fan of Franco, but if they are just rumours just imagine the devastation your going to cause him, his family and his career.  It‚Äôs ok for the public to spread rumours and gossip at home/work etc with friends, family & colleagues because our reach is small and intimate, but Rocha your comments will reach thousands who may spread your Rumour as fact.

"When tweets can destroy a person, then we live in very dangerous times. Instead of real facts that can be used to convict a man, we rely on tweets or online comments to judge a person, its going to be a global witch hunt.

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

"looking forward to both tarantino¬¥s and rian¬¥s sci-fi stories :).

wb could do like disney and star wars with dc perhaps. the wonder woman movie could be canon but you restart with shazam?
gal gadot or another actor could play wonder woman. introduce a new superman or cavill at the end? but do a restart perhaps of superman in man of steel 2 
so it becomes 1? then bring in the new batman into this restared universe? what¬¥re they going to do about the upcoming dc stuff that¬¥s still tied to 
what¬¥s already been done. and remember that batman was like bond in the 90¬¥s with different actors doing the continuing adventures. more humor sure but
only to the right characters.

a tweet isn't the truth, there has to be proof of some kind. it‚Äôs a little worrying but just rumors at this point right? is there proof?

love the shows.",0.9739,180

"rocha !!!!! you're the fucking man. neutrality will always side with oppressors and abusers, people who claim neutrality when sexual assault stories come to light are almost always using neutrality to hide behind so they can continue enjoying their art.  

and before anyone tries it, no this is not a dig at schnepp, schnepp's my guy miss me what that shit. but rocha speaking out about the common disregard of anonymous claims is so important. we should all be standing for the abused and allowing them to speak of their experiences without forcing them to out themselves and possibly re-live the trauma publicly. false accusations are criminal and should always be treated as such, but to completely write off multiple claims just because there isn't video evidence or some other form of physical proof somewhere is not the answer.",-0.9691,151
