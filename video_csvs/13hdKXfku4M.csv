"I love Christmas. My love of this holiday resonates from the magic of Santa Claus and bright colors and fun music and friends and gift giving and decorations. So tonight I watched 'A Christmas Story Live', I loved the opening music video with Bebe Rexha which just set the tone for that Christmas feeling of friends and colors and music and fun and being happy. It was such a wonderful way to spend a TV night on the 6th day of Hanukkah, which was not unnoticed in the production, as well as on the week before Christmas Eve. This song and the visuals were such a wonderful way to open the show.",0.9938,122

"Listen to the end, when she goes into the falsetto the notes are just a little off, that's how you can tell it's live, plus you can hear the studio vocals behind her live ones. She just practiced a ton for this performance, and it shows!",0.0,52

"There's something stirring
Something crackling like the firewood
A certain spirit that has lightened up the neighborhood
I think it's time for the timeless time of the year
Time of the year
You're bundled up
Got a blizzard coming on the way
The family fighting like they do
'Cause it's the holidays
And every memory you're holding in your heart is alive once more, right here

[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like you're a kid again
Making you remember
When life was good
Just watching the snow fall down

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
Just remember in December what is coming 'round
And you'll find the feeling that you always found
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Coming back home to the old address
Something burning in the kitchen with the house a mess
And this year is promising nothing less
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Count on Christmas, count on Christmas

[Verse 2]
We got a Christmas song
Sing-a-long around the tree
Keep the eggnog flowing til we're all tipsy
There's another movie marathon on TV
Which one could it be?
But with all of the presents, all of the gifts
It's really about who you're sharing them with
And just for Christmas Eve
The world's the way it used to be

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
Just remember in December what is coming 'round
And you'll find the feeling that you always found
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Waiting up and then you hear the jingle bells ring
Santa Clause is comin' what's he gonna bring
There's a little bit of magic to everything
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
Just remember in December what is coming 'round
And you'll find the feeling that you always found
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas",0.9984,460

"This almost made me turn it off before the show even started. What an awful decision to get someone like this to do a song like this to open a Christmas classic. Nothing about it fit the theme of A Christmas Story other than the fact that it was related to Christmas. Everything else was great, but this was just terrible. I had to mute it after a minute, I'm just glad I stuck around for the rest.",0.4854,85

Wow!  This horrible introduction of this musical illustrates that Hollywood is disconnected from the rest of the United States.  I felt I was watching an Old Navy commercial.  I feel that this performance is a reason why A Christmas Story Live had the worst ratings of any previous musical.  Count on Christmas sucks and is irrelevant to the actual musical!,-0.6229,65
