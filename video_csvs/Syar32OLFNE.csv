My perspective is a bit different. All I want is a machine that‚Äôs really LIGHT. Thin doesn‚Äôt matter after the initial ‚Äúooooooh‚Äù and ‚Äúaaaaaah.‚Äù The things that matter after I actually start traveling with the machine is the screen size and WEIGHT. Keep em thick so they don‚Äôt throttle and light so I can move with them. The thinness just impedes longevity (heat decay) and usability (throttling). There‚Äôs no need to go thinner than maybe a 2015 MacBook Pro.,-0.1779,102

I would dare to say that 90+ percent of your 1 million subscribers come here for your perspective and personality more so than  solely appreciating your ""crispy"" video quality and editing. I'd rather watch someone interesting on a webcam than someone with extraordinary video skills who's boring and uniformed.

"That‚Äôs mostly marketing. It‚Äôs really just an improvement on the tech we already have on TVs now. Instead of stretching out pixels of lower resolution content, it‚Äôll guess what colors need to be filled in to create the illusion of 8k content. The more pixels the content already has, the better it works as it has more data to extrapolate from and less guess work to do.

I know it's not as nice as what you usually shoot, but I was much more interested in the content of the footage and your narration of it than I was the quality. Maybe I'm the exception to the rule, or maybe I'm just old enough to remember E3's and CES's where the best quality I could stream was 240p, so I'm spoiled by anything 720p and up, even if it's not as well lit or crisp as it could be.",0.3443,133
