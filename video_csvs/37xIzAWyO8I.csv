A really good way to get a cheap sharpener that works well is to use a higher quality artist's pencil sharpener. I use a decent quality yet cheap one from a brand I use to sharpen my professional grade art pencils with and it works just as well of not better than a high end makeup brand one.,0.6107,60

I have no clue why Americans think the UK is a better place, because it really isn’t. Remember that white Americans are originally British after all (or at least European).
