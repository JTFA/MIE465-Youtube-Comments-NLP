"I live in the quadrate and my address looks something like this: ""N5, 3 68161 Mannheim""

However, I personally choose to include my apartment number to make life easier for the mailman (a lot of people live in this building). Plus, every now and then  I can't just enter ""N 5, 3"" as my address on websites because it is ""too short"".

So basically it ends up looking something like this:

Name
N5, 3
Whg. 219 
68161 Mannheim",0.7964,96
"I lived in MA and still am living in the vicinity. You only need to google major companies located in the centre, e.g. the Sparkasse Rhein-Neckar. Their official address is 
Sparkasse Rhein-Neckar
D1, 1-3
68159 Mannheim

So way simpler than addresses in the UK or the US, e.g.
You only put the number of the ""Quadrat"", in this case ""D1""; then the number of the building, in this case ""1-3"" (two merged buildings), and then the postal code ""68159"" and the city of ""Mannheim"". Done.

And even the orientation within the Quadrate is simple. As said in the video, you have one major street dividing the Quadrate in the eastern part running from A in the south to K in the north (postal code 68159), and the western part (postal code 68161) running from L in the south to U in the north. Then you simply add the block number by starting on the ""inside"", so at the said major street (which was and is the main street leading from the gigantic Mannheim castle through the middle of the symmetric Quadrate), running from A1 in the middle south to A8 in the western south (and accordingly K1 to K8 in the north), and from L1 to L13 (exception) in the eastern south (accordingly U1 to U8 in the eastern north).

Once you understood this system, it is really easy to locate every single shop and block within the city centre of Mannheim. A wonderful and fascinating city with lots of history.

"I was thinking... putting names to streets is a bit silly, and you have to remember the names if you want to know where a building is located. Plus, they take up space and are a PITA to write. So we should adopt a parallel (street names can still be used, of course) numerical system for -naming- numbering buildings in the world (more meaningful and easier to remember than coordinates). That would make things easier for us because it's easier to remember a small number than a long name, especially if it's correlated to a geographic area. ""I live in the building 02BF3C4"" (in hexadecimal, of course, because it's cool). This could mean planet 0 (the Earth, we're still not on Mars, but we'll be soon), country 2B (there are less than 256 countries in the world, I think), region F3, street C, building 4. Of course, more digits must be added if there are more than 256 regions in a country, 16 streets in a region, or 16 buildings in a street.",0.5596,211

By the way, even though Ludwigshafen is incredibly ugly, you might want to come here.

Today, the train station is used at a tiny fraction of its capacity and the literal highways have to be torn down soon because they have become dangerous. It's a true sign of optimistic, but short sighted city planning run amok, combined with corporate greed, since the BASF, which by the way spans the whole lenght of most city districts,  wanted it to then just build their own train network.

If you had, for example, 13x13, then you could just use letters. So the top left block might be AN, and the bottom right MZ. The main difficulty with any choice like this would arise if and when the urban area begins to expand. However, if it's already surrounded by suburbs without a block basis, that's a moot point. Oh, and one more thing: in a very tall city (e.g. sci fi future city), we might start thinking about the third dimension too :)

"In Puebla (and probably other cities in Mexico) there is a similar concept. You use North/South/East/West to create a grid and you use numbers to indicate the number of blocks away from the center.

The 1701 means that it is between 17th and 19th street and to differentiate between north and south, you just use pair numbers for south and odd numbers for north (same for east/west). That way you know an address is valid without going there. (for example, you can't have a 2 west 1801). And to avoid using negative numbers, you use west when addresses are in the north and east when are in the south.",-0.8225,153

"Why dont they call the roads (on maps) A-B (for the road that runs between the A and B blocks), B-C, C-D etc?  and in the other direction they would call it 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 etc. Maybe call it something like 'Road A-B', or maybe 'Quadrattus A-B', this would surely make things reasonably logical, and provided they managed to put a permanent indicator (atleast when the street names appear) of each block on the map, anyone unfamiliar would soon work it out.",0.3612,103

No, Tom. The reason they should change it is to be *normal* and be in line with international *standards* that make the world more accessible and navigable to everybody. I'm all for preserving history, etc. but this is just stupid.",-0.7351,72
