"75,000,000 innocent babies.  That figure is probably low.  Not criminals.  Not illegal aliens.  But innocent babies who did no wrong to anybody!

Are you proud to have been a part of that slaughter? 

 Keep voting Democrat!  You and your children may die sooner of some disease because of your vote.  Your children will have a good chance of being seduced into becoming a homosexual since Democrats passed a law in California to teach homosexuality in elementary schools.  That should make the children more easy to seduce by homosexuals!

 Then to protect them and yourself they can say they were born that way!  Evil has no love.  Evil has no friends.
Keep voting for Democrats.   Hasten the demise of yourself.",-0.8904,136

"Abortion became legal and popular because Democrats and the anti God Media promoted it as a ""right.""  
You can't tell me that we could not have stopped the slaughter of 75,000,000,000 innocent babies.  The only people who were vocal against abortion were Christians and most Republicans. 
Sure we could have stopped abortions. No, you were not preventing any deaths. If you are speaking to women who died having illegal abortions.  Those amounted to 5 to 8 women a year! That was all.  There are dozens of more women dying from legal abortions today! Not counting the women who lose their minds after realizing they just murdered their own child.  Those statistics and other negative statistics are not spoke of in our Left Wing Democrat Media.  That is called selective news, or biased news.

Homosexuals are made not born.  That they were born that way is another lie big by our Socialist Democrat Mass Media.  That gave people who were ashamed to admit they were seduced an excuse.  
Why is it that for hundreds of years homosexuality was viewed as a sickness, an addiction, a disease.  But soon as the Democrats and Liberal Mass Media took up homosexuality as a ""right,"" it was not longer viewed as such?   That changed almost overnight by Mass Media and Democrat backing.  Another big lie that destroys life. 
Democrats and Mass Liberal News Media let the homosexuals out of the closet and gave militant homosexuals the power to make homosexuality mainstream. Now tens of thousands of homosexuals have AIDS, Syphilis, Gonorrhea and other STD's.  They will die horrible deaths and the innocent and decent will have to pay their medical bills, as usual. 
If the people were honest about how they became homosexuals they wold admit they were seduced through their passion and lust.  It is easy to become a homosexual and almost impossible to reverse it.  That is why it is so dangerous to the human race!",-0.9651,362

"Many people on your side do celebrate abortion. I have heard women brag and boast about their abortions.  If you have a once of decency you will separate yourself from this evil. 
Homosexuality is freedom of choice.  So is using drugs, so is murder!
Why champion a lifestyle that kills?  Democrats do not care as long as you vote for them.  Homosexuality is a dirty, unclean, way of having sex.  Homosexuals sex leads to sexual diseases.  Do yourself a favor and look up, google, STD reports for the last five years, or ten years.  You will find one group very prominently mentioned in those reports, homosexuals. 

 You will be paying their medical bills.  Your children and grandchildren may become victims of homosexuals. 
Democrats in the California Legislature passed a bill last year to force elementary schools to teach your children to accept homosexuality a an good alternative to heterosexual sex.  This is indoctrination to make it easier for homosexuals to seduce your children!  Thanks, Democrats.

Yes there are a lot of religions.  Man has always tried to understand his existence and what it means.  Man has created their own gods to answer and satisfy those questions.
But there is only one True Religion.  Only one religion created by the God who created the Universe and everything in the Universe.  That religion is Christianity.... and Judaism.   There is only one religion with over 25,000 documents from ancient times to prove it is the only true religion.

The Bible has not been altered except for some word because of difference is ancient languages.  The Dead Sea Scrolls Prove the Bible has not been altered in its original meaning.

"Strange, last I checked, California gives more to the US than Texas. On top of that, we also provide the most agriculture to the US as well. Yea the percentage would sound close, 9% from Texas, 13% from California, but that 4% ends up being upwards of a trillion dollar difference in how much we bring into America. In other words, Texas gives a surplus of men to fight in wars, California gives you the money for your guns, tanks, planes, ships, all and more. That difference between California and Texas completely covers the budget for our military each year, plus more. 

Trust me, America needs California more than it needs Texas.

Oh, by the way, I was kidding about Texas providing all the soldiers, since you know, California provides more warriors than your 'Manly' Texan state, by a long shot.",-0.394,172

"The Bible has not changed. You list the changes if you are so sure of them.
The Catholics have accepted many books that are not accepted by Christians as legal canon.  Just think in two thousand years how many people have written books they promoted as Bible quality books.  Thousands and thousands.  Yet the books now accepted as cannon have been the same books for almost two thousand years.  That proves the Holy Spirit has guided these books to be accepted by all Christians.
Many books written by close friends of the disciples were rejected because there was something in them which did agree with most of the other books.
The Bible's accepted books were written by EYEWITNESSES TO WHAT JESUS TAUGHT AND WHAT THEY SAW WITH THEIR OWN EYES.  Most of these were the Disciples of Jesus and Paul. 
It is so easy to deny the truth because the whole world is encouraging you to side with Satan.
There are only Two sides in this whole World!  God's side and all others!
God is now polarizing the World into two sides.  It will be harder and harder as time proceeds to chose God because the anti-Christ will provide great wonders and deceptions to keep people following him.
This life is just a test for the real life!  The real eternal life is full of joy. No worries, no tears, no trouble.  That life is for eternity!",0.9772,258
"The Dead Sea Scrolls proved the Bible has not changed any significant degree.  Some books of the Dead Sea Scrolls read exactly like our Bibles today.
The Roman Catholic Church has flaws.  They accept many books most Christians rejected.  The books that were accepted as Doctrine for the Bible were accepted around 350 AD.  Those books are still part of the Bible.  
God has continued to guide men.  The Holy Spirit moves men to do God's will.  But man can decide if their will is stronger than the urgings of the Holy Spirit. 
The Roman Catholic Church has many problems but God still used that church to spread the Gospel all over the World.  Even if that was not done perfectly it was done!  No man is perfect. Any Christian will admit they are sinners.  But at least we are saved unlike those who do not accept Christ as their Savior.  Man was not meant to be perfect just to find God in his imperfectness. 
God is now polarizing the World into Two Main Camps.  Those who are seeking or have found God and ALL OTHERS IN THIS WORLD.  
This process will lead to persecutions of Christians just like in Roman times.  Islam and other false religion will become a part of this New World Religion.  This New World Religion will be formed to make war against the Jews.  This war will bring Christ back after two-thirds of the Jews are killed.  But before all this takes place the Church of Christ will be taken up to meet Christ in the air.

While the stds are a problem, dont plan on losing any relatives to homosexuality because they would have to gay as well. Also, the reason those rates are higher is because anal sex is the only way to do it for half of homosexuals and anal has MUCH higher rates in any sexuality. And as for religon, the bible HAS been altered multiple times by the roman Catholics, orthadox and many more.

We are in the last quater of the final hour of Satans control of earth, Jehovah very soon will give his son Jesus Christ the command to remove Satan from earth. Please read your bibles listen to the voice of the Almighty God our heavenly Father ask that you will be saved from Gods judgement against Satan and those who wickedly follow his rebbelion. Jehovah will command his son and angels to guared guide and protect you, it is up to you to ask for his protection and survive the final epic battle that will protect the earth and mankind against an evil and wicked predator Satan. Satans rulership is over. The earth will then experiance wonderful blessing fortold in Revelations 21:3,4.

We can't put out some fires its nuts!! Why??? We can rain down fire and fury but cant put out a some in our back yard. Im from Oregon and these guys are in no rush. Somthings off about all this. The technology we say were so far advanced in and we cant even put out our first creation as a monkey according to our masters brain wash. We can deystroy the earth 100 times over with our destructive power but cant stop fires in the state that grows 80% of the worlds food.,-0.8033,105
"Well first off, no nation on Earth can destroy Earth 100 times over. The sheer amount of force required is greater than every single nuclear bomb and explosive combined on this planet. You would need another planet smashing into Earth of equivalent size to shatter it. 

But anyways, as for the fire, there's a reason as to why the firefighters look as if their lounging around, and it's because of wind. You're not down here in LA as you just stated, so I will tell you now that we are currently in a windstorm. It doesn't sound bad, and to be frank, 40-60 mph winds are nothing compared to the hurricanes we see on the east coast. However, you combine that wind with a fire and it's bad, it's real bad. It took less than a minute for a fire stretching ~10 acres to eat up the entire face of a mountain because of the wind factor. It's because of the wind that the Ventura fire is now a quarter of a million acres of devastation. 

To put it in perspective, a fire during our summer heat, Firefighters will advise to evacuate, but homeowners will stay put and use their hoses to keep the fire at bay from their home. However, with these winds, it's an absolute mandatory evacuation. Police and firefighters will show up to drag you away from your home, even if you wish to stay, because no sheer amount of technology we have today will stop a blazing inferno being fueled by a windstorm. One second it's a mile away, next second it's engulfed your neighborhood and you'll end up dead with no way of identifying who you ever were, forgotten and assumed to have gone missing.",-0.973,322
