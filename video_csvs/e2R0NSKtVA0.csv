"Humans have a conditioned reflex. We actually accomodate words to fit our pre-existing speech patterns.
That is the reason which a person with an accent, any accent, can learn a word from a person who has a clear accent or clear speech, and then translate it onto their own accent.
So, there is not ""italian accent"" or any other type of accent. I can assure you, and Italian peasant and Italian royalty would have very different uses of accent and tonality.
Rather, people literally add their own, personal accent-which they copied from others if it is ""cultural accent""- and then they add that accent onto every word that they learn. Regardless of whether or not they learn that word in its clear or proper form.
And the reason why people do that sort of thing is because they WANT to compartmentalize themselves within society and away from other human beings. To tribalize. To form cultures. Groups. And if it is done by habit, it is done by instinct.
That means, that this wasn't really funny or cute if you think about it and look at it closely. That woman MUST have desired to be secluded in society, in culture, in order to have developed an accent that thick. That is, after having had decades to realize what kind of effect being hyper-cultural can have like what happened with Italy in WW2. That she must have known.
Ignorance is not harmless. The armies of wars are often populated ignorant himan beinga. College educated people don't run off to another country to brutalize other human beings.
Hyper-culturalized people who are obviously mentally deficient are not ""funny"". And perhaps it's not their fault that they are as they are. But entire groups of people laughing at them, in a kitchen table or on Youtube comment sections, are the reason why humanity does not deserve peace. Because, most people are concerned with laughing like fools, when it is known that war is profitable and desireable for those with power. There are still armies in this world. And they aren't there to sell boy-scout cookies.
And Italian Grandma who can't operate an electronic device properly. Hes, very amusing.",0.8789,414
