"Honestly, I came here to watch because of Charlie Puth ❤️His chords, his posture and his facial movements were super cool, super cute and very confident throughout his performance. 
However Rudy is surpassing Charlie by a little bit, coz he was very meticulous about each and every note that he played. Also his finger movements were excessively rapid. Also, there were no clarity issues throughout his melody section. Although he played almost the melody section, it made me feel like he carried the hardest part, not by his facial expressions or anything like that, but the way how he was flipping those notes (I mean the main beat & his inner notes)
However, I'm taking Charlie's side. He is my favourite role model. Seriously, he is a pro at throwing positive energy wherever he exsists! I really wanna see him and interview him before I die. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ That's my 1st bullet point in my LAST WILL!!!",0.9457,190
