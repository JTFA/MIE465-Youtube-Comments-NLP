It was always my understanding that the design of the system was to easily cater to left or right-handed people, so that it could be flipped over and played comfortably.

Ultimately I'll take the brighter new screen though.",0.8689,72
I guess the only other modes I'd like on the Lynx would be a modern battery solution and you could add an SD Card Cart to it (although I do like the original game cards).

"SmittenTheKitteninMittens - I think it's a little of both, actually.  The GPU was pretty impressive for the time... not surprising, since it was designed by two of the guys who had designed the Amiga.  The Lynx had dual frame buffers and a blitter to draw each frame.  It's worth pointing out that the 3DO video system is an evolution of the Lynx architecture.

On the other hand, the SUZY chip had to share the 64 kB of system DRAM, and on an 8-bit bus, at that (16-bit address bus, 8-bit data bus).  So the memory bandwidth was severely limited... the resolution of 160x102 is the only thing that made a decent frame rate (up to 75 fps) possible.

(For those who don't know: The Lynx had a 4,096 color palette, but you could only have 16 colors per scanline.  You could, however, change palettes between scanlines, allowing for more colors on screen.  There was also a 16-nybble ""pen index"", allowing for palette effects, like color cycling, while still having only 16 colors per scanline.)",0.8043,215

"The battery life in the Lynx was also complicated substantially by the lack of ability to ""sleep"" the CPU at any time. There were hardware bugs that would constantly ""wake up"" the processors, and reading information from the ROM cartridge was also a power hog since it was accessed through a single byte input port (unlike all of the other game systems which used memory mapping for the ROM).",-0.0679,78
The new display is a real must-have for your Lynx! :-),0.3802,12
The original vision catches up with contemporary tech. Nice.,0.7269,11
The resolution is 160x102 far less even than 240p you're right.  I'll get it wired up some day and share the results,0.296,23
The same mod is available for the Game Gear :D,0.6166,10

This is a night and day difference. Worth the time and effort to do the upgrade for sure!,0.5411,20
"This is an amazing upgrade.  I'm curious now though, is there any chance anyone has developed a lithium ion solution for the lynx?",0.8555,26
This is easily one of the best videos I've ever watched about the Lynx. The series about it is awesome,0.8934,21
This mod should be a requirement to play a lynx or a game gear.,0.34,15

"Very cool video. I have a broken Lynx that I'd like to get working again and would love to get that screen mod put in. I'm awful at that kind of thing, though.",0.4927,37
Very kind thank you Nathan I've really enjoyed making this one,0.8769,11
Very nice.,0.4754,3
Watching the spinning logo of California Games on this screen (especially including on the new screen !) I felt young again :)) Would be great to have this spinning licence plate with same video quality as a screensaver for my computer :Þ (Or maybe the result would be ugly on a 27'' computer screen... but hey... it's an idea to try).,0.1759,72
"Well done, looks great",0.7351,5
"Well, considering that the CPU is a 65C02 running at 3.6 MHz... you're probably right.",0.2732,18
"Well, if you´ll excuse me - i´ll be off to the Dragonbox, ordering one of those LCD screens ... good thing im one of them cabbage-eaters, so it should be here reasonably fast. Joke aside, your video actually convinced me to swap the old screen of my Lynx for one of those new LCDs. Incredible video, as usual. Funny thing - I had no idea, they were selling those, although I had already bought a Retrode there (one of those SNES and Mega Drive Cardridge readers, neat little thing btw) so, thanks for the point out.",0.9489,115
"Well, the GBA is a 32bit system that was released a good 10 years after the Lynx, so on a hardware level, it's much more advanced. It's game library is massive (even more so on backward compatible models) and there's all sorts of genres - whereas Atari tended toward arcade-type games. But if you're asking about the screens - that replacement LCD on the Lynx is light-years ahead of the GBA's - the original model had a horrible, unlit screen that is incredibly murky and dim. The SP-101 model has a lovely backlit screen, as does (I think) the GBA Micro and of course, the DS Lite when playing GBA titles (but no GBC or original GB on the DS Lite). That said, I hate the cramped form factor of the SP and GBA Micro, and you can fit an SP-101 screen (with some work) in an original model GBC, which makes it a much more viable handheld. Add a multicart like an Everdrive and you're in handheld heaven.",0.9402,196
"What If? I use composite out on a Pi3 to try and get an authentic output, but it only outputs in 480i (interlaced) rather than 240p so even that feels wrong.  Sometimes only the original hardware will do.  But in the case of the Lynx the original screen was its weakest part for me.",-0.5719,61
What a difference! Well worth it.,0.5093,8
"What a great mod. I only ever had a Gameboy as a handheld, a friend had the Lynx and it used to eat batteries :-D It's really nice to see people still developing so many mods and additional peripherals for all the retro systems.",0.9374,47
"What a great upgrade, but am I seeing things (at 9:13), or does the top of the screen have several dead pixels??",-0.5514,28
What a world we live in. I have just paused a brand new episode of the Grand Tour to watch this! Think of the difference in the budgets and yet you still won them out.,0.7901,38
What an awesome upgrade.. I need this for my Lynx 1. :D,0.8455,14
What an incredible difference it made..I'm gobsmacked. Can this mod be performed on a GBA as the screen ruined that wonderful machine?,0.1531,26
"What's interesting is that LCD looks to be 4:3, but the resolution of the Lynx is 160x100, or 16:10.  Is the bezel masking a portion of the screen?",0.2144,32
"Whilst the screen protector is good for preventing scratches during installation, I'd also recommend covering the new screen with a piece of card whilst soldering just to be 100% safe. It only takes one wrong move with the iron itself or from stray solder to damage the panel.",0.2263,52
Will you be making any more mods for this handheld? Great job with those lcd wires! :D,0.8564,19

Would love to see a follow up video where the battery life is compared to with an orig screen. Top video 😊,0.7184,23
"Wow that's a huge difference, well done as it didn't look easy.  All about patience, checking, double checking and I like to throw another check in because, well....things can go wrong.  Good Job!!  oh and you do realise I now have to get a lynx and do this mod.....grrrr :-)",0.8744,62
"Wow that's incredible, well done to whoever took their time to come up with that kit.
I notice that's a Lynx 1, is this applicable to the Lynx 2 as well?",0.7906,35

Wow! Just wow! 👍🏼,0.8475,7
"Wow! The difference is night and day. That screen really makes this system shine. Great work, surface mounting jumper wires always scares the crap out of me. What really warms my heart is the fact there still people in the world making products, mods, upgrades, and parts for these old systems.",0.7639,60
"Wow, can't argue with those results. I must learn how to solder/de-solder that stuff to upgrade mine with the time comes. Thanks for this video!",0.8413,31

"Yuki Saitou I have the latest EZ Flash 4 and gotta say I would never pay for the Everdrive. All you get better on the Everdrive is RTC, rest is same + no bulge outside. These things are amazing.
On the Lynx tho: that device is a clear case of ""too ahead of it's time"". The color backlit LCD was to be the killer but well, it really was some 10-15 years too soon. Nintendo never tried too much on handhelds and managed it cheaply in other hand.

Now that the Lynx has been brought what it needed on start, it's REALLY impressive indeed.",0.9524,117
"Yup, also the same in the Game Gear!",0.0,10
ZygmaExperiment don't forget that you can emulate GB/GBC easily on a DS using an R4 cart or similar. Most games are compatible and it even has a turbo mode for easy grinding in RPGs :) I still prefer my backlit original GBA though which I bought pre-modded for a very reasonable price. I don't have an Everdrive yet but EZ-Flash just released an update for their GBA flash cart which means you don't have to pre-patch the ROMs anymore so it's almost as good.,0.8428,89
as someone who stared at a Lynx screen for hundreds of hours back in the 90's this mod has been a revelation. I can't wait to upgrade one or both of my Lynx. I've seen another video of the mod before and RMC you've done the screen proud. I've always preferred the model one as well so I imagine it will get the treatment first.,0.6369,71
awesome new screen !,0.6588,4

soverysleepy tricky to tell I film with an NEX5 which is getting old now and records at 25fps so don't take the speed at face value.  We're squeezing towards a patreon goal which will afford me a new camera to better demonstrate.,0.5719,45
