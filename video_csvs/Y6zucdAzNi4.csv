"+Robert Pascuttini MissFaithLouise is NOT speaking like a baby by stating her opinion(and mine) that David Tennant is better. You are the childish one calling people names for stating their opinion. She and I and everyone else on here is stating theirs, and you are wrong to single her out for declaring her opinion. I'm a 48 yr old woman and I'm sick of people attacking us fans of David Tennant and calling us fangirls or fanboys because he is our favorite. We love him because he is an amazingly talented, classically trained, award winning actor; and the best Doctor of all in our opinion. You don't have to agree with us and you are entitled to your opinion, I can respect yours, but you need to do likewise!",0.8802,145

"Robert Pascuttini 
I feel it necessary to point out the flaws in your logic here. You decided it was wrong for her to post her comment based upon the premise that this somehow is an attempt to direct attention from the great work of Peter toward her instead. This premise is false. Simply sharing a preference related to the doctor the video is featuring is in no way directing attention toward her or from peter. The fact of the matter is, preferring David in no way constitutes a claim that Peter is not great nonetheless, nor is it disrespectful towards his work. We can appreciate his work while possessing a preference of another, they are not mutually exclusive. And before you ask the question why someone whose favorite is Tennant would be here for Capaldi's tribute, consider the fact that David could be her favorite but Capaldi could be high-ranked in her tier of preferences as well. In my case, Tennant is my favorite but Capaldi is my second favorite, so of course id be here. Granted, I don't feel the need to state my favorite on a capaldi video, but the lesson to take away from this is that those that do decide to share that aren't in the wrong, it is technically still relevant and belittling them isn't exactly a reasonable thing to do.",0.9651,244

I was holding it together through the different goodbyes until William Shatner repeated some of 12's lines. ""Sometimes the only choices you only have are bad ones, but you have to choose. You said it yourself. Good luck."" A nice acknowledgement and true words for having to make a choice to stay or go.

"indestructablereflex I think a woman doctor was inevitable. There's no real reason why a woman can't play the role of a (basically) shape shifting alien. But I think it'll shake up the show and Jodie Whittaker is a great actress. And she said herself that ""the body just happens to be female,"" so I think we're in good hands. Anyway, writing her the same way you would any other Doctor would be the most feminist thing to do. Just because she's a woman makes her no different than the rest, in terms of character.",0.2177,107

"pjgs Yeah I never said I had a problem with the Doctor being a woman did I? I'm just really sad they're probably throwing Capaldi away without a second thought or a shot at a season without Moffat's writing that has gown downhill.

The Doctor being a woman can work great as long as they do exactly what you & I agree on. Just rarely acknowledges the gender & gets the job done like any Doctor would.",0.8468,81

"till 2005 this would never have happened. this change is not canon and, i   truly fear chibnall will do as john nathan turner did - kill off a character I like, a lot. That said... Peter Capaldi and Sylvester McCoy got 'The Doctor'.",-0.8319,51
