Only 5th scale Because they don't launch vertically?,0.0,9
"Only 5th scale You're right, it does affect them equally. Gravity has the same effect on both (pulling down), but their direction of travel man's we observe it differently.

Think about this: imagine throwing a ball straight up (let's pretend it's perfectly vertical). At some point, it's going to slow down, come to a complete stop for an instant, then come back down and land in the same spot it was launched from (assuming there was no air resiatance).
Now imagine throwing a ball (like a football). It's going to launch at an angle, then start going back down, traveling in a curve.
That's the difference between rockets and planes. Except rockets are powerful enough to escape gravity (for lack a simpler term).",0.7579,149
Only 5th scale because earth is flat in that case but once you leave the atmosphere you pass into another dimension and earth becomes round again. True cause I saw it on you tube,0.5267,35
