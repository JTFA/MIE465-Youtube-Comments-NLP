"Even though ""E"" volunteered Katt and her male co-host were receiving monetary compensation for different roles, more than double might suggest entirely different positions altogether.

That ""E"" allowed her to leave without making even an attempt to correct the situation speaks a great deal and hopefully offered Katt some awareness to the relationship. It's hard not to question having done the right thing. It might not occur as quickly as hoped but in time Katt will come to know the choice she made was the best. As a result, ""E"" looks bad and will suffer some consequences of their actions, whether its now or later, considerable differences in pay between men and women is public knowledge.

"Our gatherings should be so conducted, and we should so conduct ourselves, that when we return to our homes we can have a conscience void of offense toward God and man, a consciousness that we have not wounded or injured in any manner those with whom we have been associated or had an injurious influence over them.... LDE 86.1
Any amusement in which you can engage, asking the blessing of God upon it in faith, will not be dangerous. But any amusement which disqualifies you for secret prayer, for devotion at the altar of prayer, or for taking part in the prayer meeting, is not safe, but dangerous.‚ÄîMessages to Young People, 386 (1913). LDE 86.2
Music That Elevates LDE 86
As the children of Israel journeying through the wilderness cheered their way by the music of sacred song, so God bids His children today gladden their pilgrim life. There are few means more effective for fixing His words in the memory than repeating them in song. And such song has wonderful power. It has power to subdue rude and uncultivated natures, power to quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to promote harmony of action, and to banish the gloom and foreboding that destroy courage and weaken effort.‚ÄîEducation, 167, 168 (1903). LDE 86.3
Music forms a part of God's worship in the courts above, and we should endeavor in our songs of praise to approach as nearly as possible to the harmony of the heavenly choirs.... Singing, as a part of religious service, is as much an act of worship as is prayer.‚ÄîPatriarchs and Prophets, 594 (1890). LDE 86.4
The use of musical instruments is not at all objectionable. These were used in religious services in ancient times. The worshipers praised God upon the harp and cymbal, and music should have its place in our services.‚ÄîEvangelism, 500, 501 (1898). LDE 87.1
Television and the Theater LDE 87
Among the most dangerous resorts for pleasure is the theater. Instead of being a school of morality and virtue, as is so often claimed, it is the very hotbed of immorality. Vicious habits and sinful propensities are strengthened and confirmed by these entertainments. Low songs, lewd gestures, expressions, and attitudes, deprave the imagination and debase the morals. LDE 87.2
Every youth who habitually attends such exhibitions will be corrupted in principle. There is no influence in our land more powerful to poison the imagination, to destroy religious impressions, and to blunt the relish for the tranquil pleasures and sober realities of life than theatrical amusements. The love for these scenes increases with every indulgence, as the desire for intoxicating drink strengthens with its use.‚ÄîTestimonies for the Church 4:652, 653 (1881). LDE 87.3
The blessing of God would not be invoked upon the hour spent at the theater or in the dance. No Christian would wish to meet death in such a place. No one would wish to be found there when Christ shall come.‚ÄîMessages to Young People, 398 (1882). LDE 87.4
The only safe amusements are such as will not banish serious and religious thoughts. The only safe places of resort are those to which we can take Jesus with us.‚ÄîOur High Calling, 284 (1883). LDE 88.1
Dress and Adornments LDE 88
There is no need to make the dress question the main point of your religion. There is something richer to speak of. Talk of Christ, and when the heart is converted everything that is out of harmony with the Word of God will drop off.‚ÄîEvangelism, 272 (1889). LDE 88.2
If we are Christians, we shall follow Christ, even though the path in which we are to walk cuts right across our natural inclinations. There is no use in telling you that you must not wear this or that, for if the love of these vain things is in your heart your laying off your adornments will only be like cutting the foliage off a tree. The inclinations of the natural heart would again assert themselves. You must have a conscience of your own.‚ÄîChild Guidance, 429, 430 (1892). LDE 88.3",0.9976,795
People are so eager to jump on this #Victim bandwagon that they believe everyone should be paid the same because... Equality.

This was sad and disturbing to hear.  My ONLY criticism of this woman is that she should NOT have disclosed that it was a female exec that told her this info in a private meeting.   WOMEN REVEAL TOO MUCH THAT PUTS THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE LATER ON.   Other female execs could be distanced because of this.,-0.9158,60
"ThomasProductions2000 that's the salary his agent negotiated for him, and that's the salary her agent negotiated for her. His agent was more shrewd than her agent. It's not his fault he got paid more. Cat should fire her agent, and get a better one.",0.36,51
"ThomasProductions2000. 
Didn't you hear when she was asked if she did the same thing as the other person and she said ""it's subjective"". When you have a TV personality it's not about getting paid for the amount of work you do. She's not flipping the same amount of burgers as someone else, she's trying to attract an audience and she clearly didn't do as well as the other person of bringing attention to the show. It's the same reason Brad Pitt gets paid more than some female actor you never heard of and it's also the same reason Uma Thurman gets paid more than some male actor you never heard of. It's the TV and movie business where certain people are more valuable than others, has nothing to do with male or female.",0.8351,144
"ThomasProductions2000. You started your sentence without a capital letter and you didn't end your sentence with a period and you have the nerve to call me on uneducated? 
The people in charge obviously didn't think she was very important that's why she got paid less. As I previously asked, should Jeff wincott make the same amount of money as Emma Watson if they do a movie or show together? No because some people have talent and value and some people don't.",0.723,88
"We are still in a world where men make more and its dismissive, disappointing, and disrespectful. Once we use our platforms and get the word out things must change!

i love you catt. i watched E news because of you. You are a great host. wish you for the best,0.9451,24
i watch E! Religiously its my favorite channel and E! news is one of E!'s main shows especially for primetime. Jason Kennedy is the main host I think he took over that role after Ryan Seacrest then Juliana Rancic and now Jason. Catt is not the main host/person on E! news..like what E! said she's being paid according to her part/role.i think Catt just wants more money for what she does and riding this gender equality pay issue.Jason is nice fun lively funny host and main Man of E! Catt you're only a secondary host!,0.94,114
