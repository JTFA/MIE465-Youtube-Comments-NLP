"For me, I started falling for my friend when we were just acquaintances and I didn‚Äôt know they were dating someone. I know I‚Äôm not the most attractive person because I‚Äôm plus size so that made it easier for me to acknowledge and make my peace with the fact it‚Äôs never gonna happen. How I handle it is basically what Allison first said; put it in a box and shove that box deep down inside. She broke up with her ex and I had to keep in mind that I‚Äôm her best friend above all and I‚Äôm not here to manipulate her, so I didn‚Äôt hint or try to prevent her from dating someone else. Now she has her eye on someone who I think seems very nice and will treat her right, so I told her she should go for it and be happy. I‚Äôm not willing to sacrifice our friendship just because my dumb heart caught feelings; my pining is not her burden to bear, and it will fade away in time. Romantic love, unrequited or not, can be fleeting and I intend for our friendship to last as long it‚Äôs meant to be. I don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable, I want her to be happy. I think that‚Äôs how I knew it was really love for me, because I don‚Äôt want to be selfish and possessive. I just want her happy, even if that means her being happy with someone else and even though it‚Äôs painful right now. I don‚Äôt feel jealousy, just a bit sad and resigned but I know that will pass. And hopefully what will be left is a strong friendship. Right now my heart doesn‚Äôt seem to be moving on very fast, but I know in time this will pass. I intend to take it to my grave. But that‚Äôs just my take being in that kind of situation right now",0.9785,378

I've had really good experiences lately gushing to people about how much I appreciate their friendship and want to spend my time on them. I even asked out a friend recently, who rejected, but it was still a positive outcome because the friendship has grown. I don't think we ought to *always* tell people we want to date them, especially if they're in an exclusive relationship, but for the most part, I think sharing our positive feelings about people to those people is something most of us could do more of.",0.9905,167

Please don't listen to these two' it's on trending or was it recommended.. Anyway here's real advice on this subject..

It's how you confesse the information.
If you say it without confidence' or just suddenly spill it out loudly.

Or slowly with a lowered voice don't say noting..

Be confident say it with a very straight foward manner' 

Which shouldn't ever be a issue cause you should have told them when you first known.. The longer you wait the more creepy it becomes. Like so you've just had fellings for me all these year's? Well I've had relationships. 
You had this desire for me but keep quit like talk about wierd..

But when you do say it..

Say look I always had fellings for you, Before you say anything. I didn't ask you nor ever told you' Simply because the outcome unknown. Either you walk away don't talk with me which I'm actually cool with..

That way you don't seem like they're only person who you hangout with...

If you lose them who gives a shit.
They're probably annoyed you waited allowed them to date shitty people. Or and this is mostly woman are happy they found a guy who's actually nice and doesn't want anything from them..

You know how many guy's like the same woman. Everytime woman are nice with guy's lots of guy's catch fellings..

Should be a woman inside any dating website shit worries me how men can be so desperate..

If you're a woman you'll have a easier time with it..

Dudes it's worst cause woman normally like a men with confidence plus if she had shitty relationships and you waited year's dude chances are she'll walk away..


I'm friend's with only woman.. 
I am a Dom. 
Woman will tell me everything as its kept secret . client confidentialit√©..
The stuff I've heard about other men yikes.
I dated escorts' strippers ' business owners' a doctor..

You know who's the best most truthful and honest people strippers the stuff they dealt with . the secrets that they burried for their clients it's amazing ..

Nicest woman around..
But they all kept saying one thing..

I've got this friend who i think really likes me I ask but he just says he doesn't.. But then one day he told me' 
I don't talk to him anymore simply cause I like confidence..
Or they say .. Could you believe it this entire time he like me like gross ' secretly admire me never saying anything about it..
Like i thought I found a guy who doesn't try to get with me' and genuinely enjoys me being around them without catching fellings ..


So i guess if you're a men admitting that you like someone you got maybe 10% chance .
If you're a woman then you have a 30% chance so yeh",0.996,533

If it's eating you up and you can't hide your feelings anymore then go for it. But be aware that it can do a lot of damage to your friendship if he/she doesn't reciprocate your feelings.

Again, what if said best friend cannot keep their hands off you, they cuddle with you whenever they get the chance, they put their face to your neck while you lay in bed just to breathe you in and smell your scent after being apart for so long, and when you hold them and they look at you they they glance down at your lips the way you do when you want to kiss someone? What if people had already assumed you were a couple? Friends, family, even complete strangers comment on it. What also if that best friend tried an experiment on love, with a boy from their college, and in said experiment she wanted to figure out how long it took to fabricate love so she spent a lot of time with this boy until she got him to tell her he loved her? It took a month, she took his virginity. What if that experiment backfired on her and instead of not caring like she wanted to she started to care? What if when you saw her in person again she still told you she'd never love him? What if she still gave you those eyes, treated you that way, told you those things, all while supposedly ""dating"" this boy and still said that she really liked him? What if the last time you saw her you missed your opportunity? She looked up at you with that look and you could've just turned your head and kissed her, that easy, but you got scared and looked past her, and now you're back at your college and you're beating yourself up about it. What if she sends you snapchats with the boy and you sit and cry because you so desperately want to be him, and you hate him for it? What if every waking moment is pain and you've never felt this strongly for anyone in your entire life? What if you feel like you truly were destined to end up together? What if she's just too goddamn confusing to figure out and you're lost and lonely and sad? What if the worst pain in the world would be to lose her?",0.9982,524

"So something like this happened between my best friend and I. To make the story really short, after reconnecting after high school we became better friends. I was dating some at the time we reconnected and even though he told me he had feels for that I was dating someone at the time. As time moved on, he had other relationships and i stayed in the same one. I started realizing that I had strong feelings toward my best friend and had to keep it hidden because I was in relationship with someone else and my best friend was also in a relationship. I didn't want to create drama or end our close friendship so i never told him. One late night we were hanging out, he told me that his feelings for me were coming back and I told him I too had feelings for him. We ended our relationship with who were dating at the time. A week later we started dating and have been with each other ever since. I realize these doesn't always work out for everyone. I feel with any relationship friend, romantic ,etc, trust is important and being honest is part of that trust. I knew he had feelings when we started being friends again but trusted him because he was honest to me. I was also honest to him and knew in the beginning I had no feelings for him. Honest also can be hurtful but it is better to be honest than to lie. I had to be honest to my ex when I was telling what had happened between my friend and I that night and I ending up end our over 3 year relationship. We no longer talk despite that we close in our relationship. He deserved honesty has he had trust me in our relationship even though it cut our ties completely. Telling a friend what you really feel can be scary because i don't know what can happen. I also know that keeping feelings in can make go a little crazy on the inside.

"Went through this over the summer. Fell for this girl almost immediately when we met in college three years ago, but she had a long term boyfriend. We became really good friends and it started to really suck for me. I told her at the end of this summer and things didn‚Äôt work out the way I wanted, of course, but we‚Äôre still pretty much best friends. It does kinda suck even more now, though. And I feel like I‚Äôve placed the problem with her, like Gabby said. So yeah, I don‚Äôt have an answer either, ha.",0.9782,119

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

"i get a lot of crushes on my friends - it's been one of my main patterns of attachment. and i believe in fostering emotional intimacy, which means sharing my own emotions and receiving the other person's ones, honestly and when possibly without judgement. i am also a very big proponent of emotional consent as a very important thing. boundaries are necessary.

so, when i get a crush on one of my friends, i tell them, because they have a right to know. i make it very clear that i'm not expecting anything from them, and i'm not trying to steer our bond into romantic territory - even if the feelings were mutual, the transition would need to be made slowly and carefully. then, i see how they react: up to now, it's always been some sort of emotional rejection. i smile, tell them that their friendship is important to me, and that i would like them to consider if they want to stop doing some sort of behaviour (usually flirty banter, or a lot of cuddling, or this kind of stuff that blurs the lines and makes it harder for my feelings to go away). then, i never mention my crush on them ever again. or at least i try to, it comes up sometimes.",0.9731,244
