Janey Monir In my opinion five minute crafts use completely random clips in compilations that are irrelevant to the theme. Nifty creates useful and relevant videos,0.7717,27

OMG SOO COOL,0.3182,3
PLEASE be sure to add the number of animals on the window placard instead of just checking the box! That will ensure they know HOW many dogs or cats are there.,0.8188,33

"The sticker alerts police/firefighters/EMTs that there are also animals in the home that need to be rescued or taken care of. 

(You can also get these if you have someone with special needs or a disability in your home.) 

Personally, I think they should have shown putting vaccination records in the binder. I don’t know how a binder with my social security card is going to help my dog.",0.9153,82
"The sticker is clearly there, for the firefighters to know, that if there is a fire, or other emergency of that kind, they should rescue animals, not only people.

Apart from that I agree they should specify what happened. Although the documents are probably there in case the emergency happened, when the owner is not around, and so they know who to call, what to do with the dog.",0.6486,80

What a good dog.,0.4404,5
What the heck is the disaster supposed to be like if something bad like a hurricane or flood or somethings coming I'm pretty sure an animal shelters not gonna do much and giving your dog to a friend I think they'll have their own life to save than to worry about your dogs. Put more info on your video next time,0.7783,62
