"Her voice is so beautiful and soothing. People get so caught up in belting and all the stars with big powerful voices that they forget that those abilities aren’t requirements for being a good singer or musician. Selena is a good singer, regardless that her voice isn’t strong enough to belt or do some major vocals like many others. Her music is good, regardless. I just hope she pursues a style like many indie artists out there. Ballads and gentle songs like Lana Del Rey and Andrew Belle and music like Olivia O’Brien and Dogny. Her music would be perfect for that type of music. Whatever music she makes though is probably gonna be good, as she’s been proving since 2013. and y’all know this is just a casual rehearsal thing right? she’s probably not gonna be going all out and trying to sound perfect either lmao. and considering that she sounds beautiful as hell",0.9945,180

"I like Selena so don’t freak out by my comment. 

But idk why everyone is saying they wish she was more confident, and less insecure in singing the higher notes. 
She just can’t sing them well. It is what it is. She’s more of an alto. 
It has nothing to do with confidence or not “trying” to push your voice to hit high notes. 
It has to with having difficulty reaching the notes and cracking and fucking up if you do it. I’m sure she knows what she’s best at. What shes good at, and not so good at. 
And she knows she’s not a powerhouse.  Which is ok! 
I just felt like commenting on the insecurity thing in relation to not “going for it” or “letting go”. Because I’m also a soft singer. Just like she is.
I know my limits and know what I’d fuck up on. Doesn’t mean I’m not confident. 
Or she isn’t. 
It means we’re aware of what we’re shitty at.
It shouldn’t be mistaken for insecurity.",0.9259,227

I think it's funny how people are judging her about the high notes but it's the acoustic version and maybe practice for the acoustic so maybe it's just softer than the original and sometimes needs time to find the pitch for the acoustic point stop judging just cause it's different and for all you guys saying y'all can sing better everyone has a different tone in singing and some slightly similar,0.714,71
I think she did really good considering she had surgery and has lupus. Lupus affects her breathing and she is most likely still sore from surgery so she can’t do much or breath heavy because of it.,0.1102,41

If there’s nothing nice to say then please stop waisting your time and voicing your opinion keep it to your self. Selena works hard and has been threw a lot she writes amazing songs and she know how far her voice can go. Like some people have said in here not everyone can sing like Ariana grande. You don’t have to have a loud or strong voice to be famous and sing. I if you sound good and people like your music then there you go. Stop hating on someone you know nothing about and have no input on how hard she works to get the soft voice she does have. So again if you have nothing nice to say don’t say it at all. If Selena ever reads this I’m sorry for what people say you can’t stop everyone for hating but you did really good and you have true fans that love you no matter what.,0.9103,176

"Just because her voice is sweet, soft or whatever doesn't hide the fact that she is off key most of the time and can't control her voice. vocalists should be able to project their voice and be flexible and Selena can't, regardless of range. People always give names like Christina Aguilera, Adele, and others, but they compare her to power vocalists? Why not compare her to people like Ed sheeran (songs like A team, tenerife sea, etc) or smaller artists like Isabella Celander, Ruth B, and others that have SOFT voices. People can like her voice, but it doesn't mean she can sing well. This is coming from a person who watched her and loved her from disney channel.",0.9763,137
"Just because some people have opinions about her sound and her voice doesn't mean we're hating on her or hate her... this was just not good she literally could not even sing the hook to her OWN song :( Maybe she can't hit those high notes because of her illness and her breathing...but then in that case why produce songs that are way out of her league to perform live? To me she's either an alto or a mezzo and I have heard her sound pretty damn decent live when she sings songs that are in her range! And a singer that can't breathe properly is like a fireman without a hose! They simply can't do their job :( the thing that gets me the most about this, is that even if she was having trouble with supporting her breath, her placement of the sound was just plain lazy. She's just seems to not even try. Ugh and yet...take my money because your tracks are catchy 😭",-0.8575,179

i cried af,-0.3818,3
i hope she is not afraid to belting,0.4404,8
i just think that Selena is not confident singing live because everybody always doubt that she can sing . Give her a chance she can still improve her voice.,-0.0588,30
i like her voice but im irritated by the fact that everytime she sings there is a track playing over her voice or someone else singing over her like in this vid,0.296,32
i love her voice so much,0.6369,6
"i swear every day people lets me down. so what she can't sing like other singers! some people are saying there are other talented singers who doesn't get their chances and she has a singing career..if there are other talented and i have no doubt there are, they will get their chances too. everyone has their own time. she is successful because people who loves her can relate to her songs. stop saying she can't sing. constructive criticism is okay, because that lets a person works on his/her shortcomings. but not negativity. and if u are so talented, why aren't you in her place? thats why i said everybody will have their time. guys..stop..enjoy. let other people enjoy the song. spread love. not hate.",0.9824,149
i think she got it but shes insecure,-0.5719,8
"i think this was overall good for just a rehearsal and everything. her belting voice needs to be explored more but it's understandable that she would be kind of afraid using it considering she hasn't performed in a year and she's had surgery + stage fright and ppl doubting her. she's rlly improved in time and i lover her angelic falsetto. not everyone can sing in that register, and she is a mezzo so the keys of her songs might be too hard to sing in",0.6369,90
its like some random girl doing a cover of the studio version,0.3612,12
"jackie yes i know in part i believe is bc her fans support her singer career, that'd what i meant",0.6597,21
"no shade no tea but she cant even sing her own song...
dont come for me bc u know its true.",0.3612,23
"she actually doesn’t sound bad her voice is smooth and soothing sure she’s no amazing loud vocalist like Adele but she isn’t the worst singer only problems is she’s breathy but it’s understandable consider she had lupus and surgery a couple months ago it’s something she can work on, also she sings so quiet she has a mic and the guy is still singing louder than her but I still love Selena she seems so genuine",-0.2023,89
she could’ve done better. she shouldn’t be afraid to bring out the notes. it’s like she’s just whispering... she had a mic but it was still hard to hear! -no hate tho!,-0.8092,46
"she has a soft voice it is almost soothing
.however she has difficulty in hitting high notes...still unique tho",-0.101,22
she just ruined It ain't me😨😭 Selena please get some vocal help and learn how to sing already jezz,-0.3318,21
"she sounds really good a shame about the amas performance and the backlash she got.. she couldve done it, its upsetting",-0.5082,23
so genuine and pure,0.0,4
so if she wouldn't have been famous before do you really think she would be a successful singer now? because I don't think so,0.5859,25
sorry she can't sing,-0.0772,4
sugaaa swagg damn!! Yaaaas! #ARMY,-0.5538,8
"tbh, yeah she's not like adele or christina level but that's literally okay lmfao it's not a crime stop overreacting lol I actually found her voice really chill and soothing and I think if couldn't, she should try singing and making songs that fit her voice.",0.9737,49
the high tones 😂😂😂,0.0,6
the only time she sings in her full voice is when her backup singers are belting over her.,0.0,19
"the reason there’s so much hate is because on her tracks she sounds so powerful and vocally gifted but in person that’s not the case. No she’s not the best singer and yes that’s okay! There are plenty of people who embrace their soft, wavering voice and use it to their advantage but Selena tries to hide it behind auto tune which is why when you hear her actual voice it’s disheartening",0.1508,85
"this girl really can act but singing ... girrrrl pls stop, I like u but no no , and why that people lie to her saying “that was great” actually , no, that was terrible, she is literally whisper and that’s “high notes” are not even high , and “falsettos” are weak, gurl make a movie or something but please not try to make something that clearly you can not. And don’t came with the “she have a low voice” if she is a professional singer she should sing like one . I don’t have nothing against girl, I like her and I think she’s a really strong woman, but facts are facts.",0.1875,137
very nice...... good song selly.. am a great fan of you ..💞💞,0.8617,16
"well she cant sing and this is obvious but i think she has a unique soft voice only for asmr videos or easy covers of easy songs lmao. not her hater bc i think she is good on acting for movies, not singing¯\_(ツ)_/¯",0.97,54
"well, her range sounds good to me, music to my ears",0.6124,13
