I am American, and most black Americans are honestly STILL wanting acceptance from other races specifically white Americans. I think this is very naive and detrimental to growth within this country. Let the racists be racists and focus on peace and harmony with those who want the same things, are my personal thoughts. 

BUT to play devils advocate, I understand obviously the pain, the suffering, and oppression that still exists for minorities and specifically black in this country. I hold some anger towards this country still myself. For me its not a race thing, but moreso systematic racism and social stratification issues.There has been no rectification truly.",-0.5961,153

And i never seen Diddy at no airport making videos harassing kids with special needs either. If 50 is immature enough to do that then he is also immature enough to ride another grown man's dick because he's jealous. Diddy remains cool and don't have to harass or put nobody else down. 50 does because even with all the money he has he still has low self-esteem.",-0.707,111

I grew up in Scotland I used to hate English people for what they done do my country in 1603!!!!!! 1603 fam not the 1900s not the 1990’s when I was born fuckin year 1603 lol but you have to look within you can’t hate a person for what (a) the last man done and (b) your old man sold him self short by.

I also grew up in a country that religion separated two of the biggest football clubs, I could not wear my teams colors nor say what team I supported in front of a stranger or I could be killed, sectarianism was rife when I grew up but people/ generations mature you can’t keep fuiling the fire, even debating about it doesn’t help. 


Go on YouTube and search sectarianism in Scotland rangers and Celtic. And see what I’m talking about, I’m guessing you are American there is people in Scotland who hate Americans because they supposed the IRA, believe it or not these football clubs decide a city catholics (ira Celtic) and Protestants (uvf rangers) 


My point is now a days I see kids walking around freely showing there teams colors when I was growing up this was never possible.

"i like the panthers question but i get confused when niggas say we dont own nothing, first off its ""anything"" lol but on some real shit:

There are about 8 million minority-owned businesses in the United States, according to a 2012 survey by the Census Bureau. Of these, about 2.5 million are owned by African-Americans.

World Wide Technology, Inc.
ACT-1 Group, Inc.
Bridgewater Interiors, LLC
Modular Assembly Innovations LLC 
Manna Inc.
The Anderson-Dubose Company 
Global Automotive Alliance, LLC
Thompson Hospitality
Radio One, Inc.
SET Enterprises, Inc.
Black-owned businesses account for about 10 percent of U.S. businesses, and about 30 percent of all minority-owned businesses. Looking at the top 10 black-owned businesses by revenue, a number of these firms find their success in the automotive supplies niche and the food industry. Most of these firms were established in the last few decades, and many are still led by their entrepreneurial founders. Annual revenue of these top 10 firms ranges from a high of $6 billion to a low of around $400 million.

Do niggas really do their research or do they just talk to hear themselves? lol
