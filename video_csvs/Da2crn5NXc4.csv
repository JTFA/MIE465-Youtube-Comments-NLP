"Hey Zoella, my name is Ola and I'm from Poland. I read your three books. They are awesome !!! These books helped me a lot, especially ""How to get rid of the bamboo"". My life has changed since I read your books. I started to look at life differently. As I said your books VERY liked me, and I am very picky in choosing books. I have gained a lot of confidence in your book. I know it's very possible that you will not read this post but you inspired me very much.

Regards Ola xoxo.

"On Christmas eve, after we go to my grandma's house, my parents and I put on our pajamas, grab blankets, pop popcorn, and then we get in the car and drive around town looking at every body's Christmas lights.  We've been doing this for as long as I can remember; when it started with my extended family packing into a minivan and driving around, to when my little cousins were born and we had to take two cars and communicate via walkie talkie.  It wouldn't feel like Christmas without it.",-0.2755,100
