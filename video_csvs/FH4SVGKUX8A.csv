Hi,0.0,1
"Hi Kevin. As a Christian I would like to say it is a huge turn off for both Christians and non Christians that you spam other artists comment sections to bring views to your own videos. I've seen you get your followers to sweep all kind of videos from other chh rappers to Gawvi. As a business major I know all about the importence of marketing exposure, especially for an unsigned artist but what you're doing is embarrassing for you and disgraceful to the Artists whose videos you spam. I've listened to a few of your songs and they aren't bad but honestly I don't want to listen to any more because of the distasteful and cheap way you market yourself. I love you as a brother in Christ but this needs to stop. What good is getting a few more views if it means turning off a whole audience from ever listening to you again? Ironically you are tarnishing your brand with the same method you want it to bring exposure to it with.",0.4096,184
