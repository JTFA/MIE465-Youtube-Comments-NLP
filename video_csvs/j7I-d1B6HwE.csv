"Aleksy E • Aleksy E • I edited my comment cuz you edited yours. Idk why you're comparing artists now. A lot of artists want to collaborate with BTS, so that's enough for me. And 100m views are a lot for a music video. I need some fucking successful Asian stars in the US ok, stop annoying me",0.3167,64
"Aleksy E • I got the information from the billboard YouTube account. Ok yeah, we've been talking to much. Imma stop now. But that bitch who first responded to the main comment, Dwight, can suck my balls. No respect, ok now I'm done. Peace",0.2732,53

"Aleksy E • I mean they won't ALWAYS be on the billboard all the time, so I can understand if they can't go on the main stage because of that but idc about the stage. I'm talking about how great BTS is and their fans are. You yourself probably don't know much about music either, so wtf are you to say that. If you don't understand me you need to expand your vocabulary",0.2024,78
"Aleksy E • I'm already listening to a beat maker's beats, BTS. Ikr BTS can make THEIR OWN great beats. Plus, I understand them. There is such a thing called subtitles stupid. Also, their natural faces look beautiful. Their skin are most likely clearer than yours",0.7964,54
"Aleksy E • The Chainsmokers, Steve Aoki, and Desiigner already collaborated with BTS. Zedd, Marshmellow, and maybe Khalid want to collaborate with BTS. You also don't know me. Army goes mad hard to the point we basically stalk them and watch every thing they do, so I know more about BTS than you think I do",-0.5106,64

"Because compared to Western artist, let's just admit not only facts, but statistics as well...They aren't as big as American artists. Even artist in Great Britain, Australia, and Canada aren't considered BIG unless they top the American charts. BTS is trending now, but so was PSY(who had a huge main stage performance)...but he actually did top American charts. But it's just a phase... Yes Army's are persistent, but compared to American artists...who have 5x, 10x, 20x...even 100x as many followers...Also, working with others artist doesn't prove or guarantee anything. They aren't the first Korean act to do a collaboration with Western artists...nor will they be the last. Contrary to what you actually think, BTS is limited to what they can achieve because they have limitations Western artist don't. Also, reading subs doesn't really mean you understand them. I've read subs on MVs and movies that I understood and it never translates the same. I'm someone who enjoys music's period...I listen to Kpop, Chinese pop, Bollywood, Spanish, English, and Thai..along with instrumental music. But just because I enjoy it, I'm not dumb enough to think the rest of the world would feel the same way or insist that they should.",0.9794,246
"Bing Crosby,Frank Sinatra,Dino,Vaughn Monroe was good and so many of the Big Band era singers..I'll have to agree with you that's real music..and I'll listen to Mozart for hours!❤️",0.69,42

"Eda Manavoğlu if it’s about where they came from and their language then 
Spanish and Latino musics shouldn’t get enough views too 
I mean what about their country or continent? 
they should’ve get tons of views just only from Asia 
I mean mathematically speaking only Asia is 4.436 billion populations
 It is too much enough to understand they aren’t the greatest 
Also musics won’t only get views from one country it’s all around the world 
So yeah we can say it’s easier to bts than Justin or Shawn 
There’s plenty of artists in USA and Canada but still no great achievement 
Why? Because music is all about talent 👀",0.921,127

"I’m a fan but Generally speaking their fans 30% is from Asia 
And 50% from Japan 
20% from other countries  
 
I see triggered fans in the comments 
Like wtf do you even know anything about music?
 it’s possible enough to say their Fans are just there for their beautiful face even tho it’s all make up 😏
Especially Stupid Americans who listen to them and claim that BTS is good at music but they don’t understand a single word 
If you like the beats go listen to a beat makers 😂 
So basically they don’t get it cuz they don’t always get on the top 10 or 100 billboard 
Like Justin or Shawn 
I think my point is clear now 👀",0.932,137

She had ""it ain't me"" ""bad liar"" and ""fetish"" so if she is with Justin for publicity why didn't she get with him for the first single??? She is the most followed on Instagram so I don't see why she would ""be"" with Justin for that. And by the way she could do way better then him cause he looks like a hobo and his face is all broke out with acne! 👋👏✌",0.7405,105

"Regina Chu why are you talking like you know a lot of things about bts 😒 you just sounds ignorant 
 many artists want to collaborate with bts 😂😂 lol 

Wtf are you talking about? You keep replying to my comments You’re the one who’s annoying me 😂

stop distorting my mind 
Don’t even reply 🤦🏻‍♂️",-0.743,67
"Regina Chu you just edited your comment, your comments didn’t make any sense and still don’t
If they’re not on the billboard all the time that means their musics aren’t good enough 
They won’t get enough attention 
They won’t get most valuable awards 
I mean what do you think of DNA 162 million views in two months? Let’s say it’s still a new music
What about the spring day 9 months and till 126 million views? 
Even Spanish and Latino musics get more views in this amount of time 😂
That means bts doesn’t have enough fans to be as big enough as their fans think they are 
And not enough fans means a lot of things
If you could be a little bit more intelligent and understand it 
 someone like Justin get 583 million views in 7 months 
Cuz His musics are good af🔥
My point was clear but you ruined with your stupid comment 😒
So please be quite you just making it worse with more comments

She's a shitty singer and her only way of staying relevant is to make herself some headlines about her love life, cuz that's what she does WHENEVER she has some new music coming out.",0.4563,96

because it was easier for justin and shawn to enter the charts since they are western artists it is not about the fanbase .... BTS breaking the barriers and achieving those things are harder to do and kind of a really huge deal since they are songs are not even in english . so their achievements are not really small compared to shawn and justin .,0.659,66
