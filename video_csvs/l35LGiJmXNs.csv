""I see no down sides to leaving on a no deal...""
Just to be clear, no deal means no transition phase and therefore no time to replace needed EU agencies right?
Also
""project fear. Which I might add, has already proven to be a big fat lie.""
What do you mean with this? I've heard this before, but everytime I ask for a source I only get links to thinks people have never said. (like Camerans WW3 prediction, that was never uttered by him or the Bank of Englands prediction of a ""technical recession"" after the vote, which was also never said by the BoE)

You asked for something concrete and very specific:
The US has already announced (like the EU before), that if the UK leave the EU air regulation without having a replacement of their own, the US can't accept airplanes from the UK or airplane parts from the UK anymore.
So airplanes and airplane parts produced in the UK couldn't be exported to the UK and US. UK airlines couldn't fly to the US or EU.

Same goes for many other industries and part of life aswell.
An other example would be cancer treatment.
Right now most of the radiactive isotopes used for cancer treatment by the NHS are sourced in the EU and in a no deal scenario, this won't be possible anymore.
As you might know, radioactive material is a highly regulated market and right now Euratom does this for the EU. If the UK leaves without a deal, then the UK has to create their own Euratom and that agency has to be recognized by all trading partners, etc. This needs time, that would be missing in a no deal scenario and would at would lead to delays in cancer treatment, which would lead to deaths.

And an other one.
The US has annouced, that they will put a tariff of 80% on Bombardia airplanes made in the UK, this will hurt the production in the UK.
In the past the UK could react to this with the might of the EU and apply preassure as the EU has much more economical power than the UK. Due negotiation power of the UK in this case is much much weaker.",-0.9936,423
"+BritishFreedom
""to give the EU £50 billion...all for a poxy""
The 50bn has nothing to do with a trade deal. The EU wants that money no matter what.
If in a case of ""no deal"", the UK doesn't pay, what they EU thinks they owe, then the other members will sue the UK at the ICJ for breaking Arikle 70(1)b of the treaty of vienna. Even the house of lords have recognized, that many exports disagree with their conclusion, that the UK doesn't has legal obligations.

""Let's do some maths eh?""
Oh I love math, let's have some fun.

""First, leaving without a trade deal will save us £13 billion in 'membership fees'""
That is half or even less than half true.
There are many different number, depending on what you include, but the £13 billion is a gross not a net number.
5 bn of that is spend in the UK, so you would take back control of those 5bn and could spend them differently, but you would't save them.
Then there is 1bn of foreign aid, which the UK has to pay based on foreign aid, which the UK includes in the EU membership fee.
So just from that you arrive at a figure of under £8 billion (which is an error of 63% to your 13).
Then you have liabilites like pensions that you still have to pay. (which is included in the exit bill)
Then you have to mirror, staff and fund all the EU agendies that you can't use anymore, but need, like food saftey regulation, radioactive material regulation, air safty, financial, drugs, etc.
So the final number will be much much lower.

""Then there's the external tariff. ...That equates to around £30 billion a year.""
Nope.
You are right that tariffs are often not included in the ""membership fee"", but the 13 billion already includes the TOR. And it doesn't equate to 30billion, but 2.5billion. The TOR for all of the EU was around 20billion € last year.

""fishing...100,000 tons... Over £10 billion, times that by 6 and you add another £60 billion plus to our economy.""
Do you have a source for that? That would mean fish is 100£ per kg in the UK? Those numbers don't make any sense at all.

""Once out of the EU's tariff regime we can source goods cheaper from around the World, helping the poorest in society.""
The average tariff in the EU is around 2%. The british pound has lost over 15% and is still down around 10% due to the brexit vote. 2% is much smaller than 10%. (Cars is an exception with an unusual high tariff of 10%, but still that would be a 0 sum game right now)
So would you be already out of the EU, you would pay more for most import goods and break even for cars.

""Ohh and BTW, on the few savings that I've outlined earlier in my comment, we as a Country are already £100 billion a year better off.""
Yeah but only because you made up the numbers or cherry picked them in a way, that you could count thing multiple times or cout losses as gains.",0.8463,645
"+BritishFreedom
Oh and one thing I've just remembered.
You seem to have little idea how the WTO works, which isn't a shame as few do, but it makes your comment look rather silly.

On one hand you count the money you save from keeping tariff, instead of giving them to the EU, then you talk about ""source[ing] goods cheaper from around the world"" after leaving the EU's tariff regime. So either you get rid of tariffs and product become cheaper or you you keep the tariffs and have more money. You can't get rid of tariffs and keep tariffs at the same time.
Also it is a 0 sum game, as no matter if you keep tariffs or not, in sum you have the same, cause the UK pays the tariffs.

And now regarding the WTO, you want to get rid tariffs (to get cheaper products), but you want to put tariffs on products from the EU to counter EU tariffs. That would violate WTO rules.
The most basic rule of the WTO is the MFN (most favorit nation rule), which means that every WTO member has to give every country the same best deal, so all countries can compete. (There are few exemptions)
As an example:
The EU has a tarif on cars of 10%. No matter if a car is produced in Mexico, USA or timbukto, it will become 10% more expensive in the EU.
For the US the tariff is 2.5% on cars. So no matter if from the EU or Japan, the cars will be 2.5% more expensive.
The UK can't put a tariff of 2.5% on cars from the US and 10% on cars from the EU. That would violate WTO rules. So either you match the EU tariff, but can't import cheaper from around the world or you have a lower tariff (like 2.5%), but you would have to give the same to the EU as to the US.",0.4547,379

""WTO (who's tarrifs would render it unviable)""
Have to disagree here. Yes going from EU to WTO rules would hurt, but wouldn't really render it unviable.
Sure some industries, like cars, would feel a solid hit, as it would be more viable to produce everything in the EU, (and some food would become very expensive) but on average the tariff of the EU is only around 2%, which would have a noticable effect, but would be less catastrophic than you make it seem I would say.

""Actually the principle behind the article 70 conflicts with article 50""
Yes they do and like in every other form of layered law, article 50 therefore applies in every conflict and article 70 applies in all cases that are not specified in article 50.
To be more specific, article 50 overrides (part) of article 70, 56, 65, 67 and 68 of vienna. And article 56,65,67 and 68 still apply for everything that isn't specified in article 50 and I can't see a reason why that should be different for article 70.

"From 2016 on an article on EU criminals costing us an increased £150 million a year...

""The claim comes as shocking figures reveal a 240 per cent rise in EU convicts filing our jails at the cost 
to the taxpayer of £150million. Meanwhile, prisons in eastern Europe are experiencing a drop in their inmate populations."" WOW, it's almost like they released their criminals and funnelled them to other countries because they didn't want to deal with the hassle anymore.

""Just days ago a landmark European Court of Justice ruling barred member states from sending prisoners back to their EU countries to finish their prison terms if their human rights are threatened there. The ruling prevented Germany extraditing suspected criminals to their homes in Romania and Hungary because of fears their fundamental human rights would be at risk by the condition of the prisons.""

"GeniusofMozart- You've got it all wrong, the pound going down etc. should be short term, so long as a competent government was handling the process.  But we've got the spineless Theresa May in power, who was a staunch Remainer, so she has no appetite for delivering what the majority voted for.  She was Plan B should the elites lose the referendum, and true to form she's trying to water it down as much as possible, putting it off if she can.  It's the Iraq inquiry all over again, drag it out until we can't stand to hear of it anymore.  The EU does need us far more than we need them, that's a fact, we shouldn't pay one penny to them, these are common sense things that a real leader, a Leaver, should focus on but May panders nonetheless.

Brexit is essential, we can't stay, particularly when their main argument against daring to leave was blackmail (our grandparents and their parents would be ashamed of Remainers; imagine if we submitted to Hitler because he threatened us if we didn't!).  Not to mention the fact that we're losing our culture (we're a minority in London and Birmingham, our 2 biggest cities, which is unbelievable).  Wages are actually going up now that a significant number of Europeans are leaving/not coming here in as great a number, and that British people are the only ones left to fill positions, I see that at my place of work; no more cheap labour willing to work 12 hours a day.  If we had a competent government, they would have no excuses for total control over the borders, non-EU and EU, they would halve immigration immediately, deporting hundreds of thousands, maybe even a few million immigrants who are criminals, unemployed or on benefits etc. (we have millions of Muslims, 50% of their men and 75% of their women don't work, what are they doing here???) and that would have a staggeringly positive effect on the economy through lowered crime (London would be safe to walk through), prison places available so we can actually deliver hard sentences for hard crimes, hospital beds/appointments, school places, housing available for Generation Rent (me), forcing employers to tempt British workers with decent wages, it would all work like a charm.

"Shane kenny you question the relevance of a referendum that took place 44 years ago yet the original commenter has referred to a referendum that took place 96 years ago after north and south Ireland had been divided. You claim the '73 election lacks legitimacy because of the time of troubles yet the treaty of 1921 took place after a war between the two nations (which might just have swayed opinions and it allowed northern Ireland to opt out of the free state, which it then proceeded to do. The Irish free state was then too busy in a civil war caused by the agreement they signed to raise any argument about northern Ireland withdrawing before the agreed 1 year time limit before full separation between the Irish free state and the UK was finalised.
Using that as a reference is far more muddy and convoluted than the only open and official referendum of independence for northern Ireland.  

I also doubt that it is quite 50/50. The fact that 44% of people voted for Brexit in northern Ireland shows straight off the bat that near 50% already demonstrated a willingness to stay within the UK after Brexit passed. It is then unreasonable to assume that all of the remain side would then assume leaving would be the next option, especially when taking into account the similar situation in Scotland which has led to a loss of support for the SNP party as Nichola Sturgeon continues to deny Brexit and call for another referendum there.

Finally, I really dont see how you think Dublin holds the key to the UK's future. Ireland is not the UK's most influential trading partner and it is not the only border with Europe. There is the channel tunnel which actually leads to mainland Europe and two of the UK's larger trading partners in France and Germany. It is much less convoluted to form trade deals with these nations and send them our exports directly that it is to form a deal with Ireland, ship the majority of produce across the Irish sea northern Ireland for it to cross the border then have it distributed across the EU by the Irish so you cant argue that it is to allow easier access to trade with the rest of the EU when the same planes and ships that would be needed to get goods to Ireland could just be used to get those goods to their intended nations anyway since Britain is geographically closer to them than you are, let alone you can just drive trucks to France anyway. There are talks of increased trade developments with china which is an emerging and expanding market allowing us to increase our trade there past its current rate of 4% and the US under Trump has expressed further interest in trade with the UK so there are options for improvement with nations outside of the EU too. London is still one of the worlds most prime places for banking due to the amount of traffic it gets and the UK is still an influential economy. In what way is the UK dependent on Dublin?",0.9755,549

"What utter bullshit. Everybody has access to the single market..

Let's do some maths eh? 

Firstly, leaving without a trade deal will save us £13 billion in ""membership fees""
Then there's the external tariff. that's the tariff the EU puts on goods from outside the EU coming in to the UK. the EU takes 80% of that and puts it in it's own coffers. That equates to around £30 billion a year.
Then there's the tariff on goods coming in to the UK from the EU after a ""no deal"" scenario. that's net, another £12 billion.
Then there's fishing. At the moment we catch around 100,000 tons of fish from our waters, the EU allocates 600,000 tons of fish caught to other EU states. So we catch 1 in 7 of the fish caught from our waters. That equates to 0.5% of GDP. Over £10 billion, times that by 6 and you add another £60 billion plus to our economy. 
Once out of the EU's tariff regime we can source goods cheaper from around the World, helping the poorest in society.
What do we trade with the EU? Well it makes up around 12% of our economy, mainly from multi-nationals and EU companies that operate in the UK. l It's as much their loss as it is ours and leaving on a ""no deal£ scenario will price out EU companies allowing SME's to flourish here in the UK, which they are already doing since the fall of Sterling.

I see no down sides to leaving on a no deal, if you have any concrete downsides, please put them forward, and I say concrete because I'm not interested in project fear. Which I might add, has already proven to be a big fat lie.

"You misunderstand me. I am quite happy for the UK to comply with EU regulations in business dealing within the EU. Indeed, since I would expect the EU to meet UK regulations with business is done within the UK it would be hypocritical for me to say anything else. I would also expect US exporters products to meet UK regulations when exporting here, and UK exporters to meet US regulations when exporting tot he US. 

However, at the point of Brexit, UK regulations become a matter for the UK to decide, and hence, one would expect some divergence to occur. What the EU want (and plenty of 5th columners in the UK) is for the UK to have to continue to comply with EU regulations within its own borders, regardless of whether those regulations have anything to do with EU trade. (Or to put it another way, to still control the regulatory space of an independent nation.)

This is not acceptable. It is for the UK parliament (and its delegated, accountable institutions) to set UK regulations - and yes they MAY decide that EU regs are appropriate (and copy those in the UK), but importantly, they MAY also decide they are not - based on what is appropriate for the UK, not the EU.  The US, China, or ANY sensible country, would not stand for a foreign power telling them how much electricity domestic toasters and kettles use (to pick an obvious example), and neother should the UK.

As for farmers, exporters etc. Well the UK parliament should be accountable to them, not the EU.",0.711,305
