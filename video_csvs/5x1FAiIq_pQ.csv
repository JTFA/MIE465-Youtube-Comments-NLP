"*I ADORE ALICIA! Must admit, if just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Azerbaijan (I guess you even don't know where this country is). I do know that folks always make these comments, but I believe that I will be the one you'll be excited you decided to listen to. If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed. I just need one chance and 3 minutes.*",0.9846,115
