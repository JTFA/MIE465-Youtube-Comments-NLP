"I'm afraid the marimba melodi in the beginning isn't quite right. I'll compare the eight first notes of the melody to demonstrate.

The Floppotron plays this:
F# - E - C# - E - F# - E - C# - E 

But it should be like this:
F# - E - C# - E - C# - F# - E - C#

After the second E note the melody goes back to C# again, making a shift in the melody that's very important for the feel of the song.

I've seen the same mistake in other videos (like the Mario Paint Composer video from 2010).",0.4927,124
