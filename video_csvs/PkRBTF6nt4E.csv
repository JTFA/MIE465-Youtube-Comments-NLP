"$35k isnt a drop in the bucket.....and manufactures dont offer such price incentives unless they're trying to make something more financially attractive than it already is.

Yes the Tesla P100D is quicker (not faster) than a lot of internal combustion cars but I think you're overlooking the high energy prices for the areas which would be purchasing an electric car.  Just in CA alone the TOU kW prices will be up around 0.40 an kW-h soon.  Thats a heck of a lot more than $10 a fill up.....

Charge times are also simply inconvenient.  Even if you think everyone has time to sit around while their car is charging for half an hour or more..... Not to mention if there's even a charging station anywhere near what you want to eat.  Personally, 5 minutes to fill up and go where you want whenever you want is going to be way more desirable until charge times are significantly reduced.

As for sleeping while it charges.....  Well again, that depends on how your energy kW price scale is depending on where you live and where you may be on the tiered scale.  Not even addressing the grid infrastructure problems electric cars have been placing for many areas.  Also, what do you do if there's a power outage?  I guess you limp to a power station hopefully near your home...if you even can?  Again, 5 minutes at the gas station is hard to beat.  Especially as cars get more efficient with smaller fuel tanks.

I agree though that electric cars are ""newer"" in the eyes of consumers.....even though they've been around for decades.  Seemingly the only way the auto industry has been able to bridge the gap of convenience and technology is with hybrids.  Even at that, it appears that people are still choosing regular cars over that of hybrids or electric.  The technology is leaps and bounds better than it has been but its still far from something consumers will ultimately choose over what they can have.

For instance, people today are all about vehicles that serve a multipurpose function.  Thus where the SUV was born.....even though environmentalists try to influence people into thinking SUV's are ""bad for the environment"".  It would seem logical to have less vehicles that can do many things rather than separate vehicles for other needs.  Like trucks which are VERY popular these days because not only are they very luxurious and very spacious but still haul things around with reasonable fuel efficiency.

We shall see how this plays out over time.....",0.9861,470

"1) A new model 3 is $35k before incentives (you can get $7,500 or more off with incentives, depending on where you live), cheaper than other cars with similar quality. Also, tesla's $130k P100D (0-60 mph in 2.4s) cars are faster than any other supercars that cost over a million dollars. Also, it costs like 10 bucks to fill up a full charge at average USA electricity prices, instead of like 50 bucks for a gas car. 
2) After 300 miles or so of driving, you can stop by a supercharger and let it charge up on its own for 30 minutes, during that time you can eat, or take a break from driving for so long, instead of standing waiting by your car for 5 minutes while it is filling up with gas. 
3) Being able to just plug it in whenever you get home before you sleep, and have it full and ready to go in the morning, is way more convenient than having to go to a gas station every time to fill up. Many people who buy Tesla's and other electric vehicles do so for the convenience, with environmental satisfaction not even taking any part in their decision. 

Electric cars are still newer to wide public use than gasoline cars, so just give it some time and they will become even better than they are now.",0.9287,261

(just thought I would through that in there in case you didn't know that either)

Edit,  Never mind, You were looking at the LA times and fell for that?  Do you have a clue what an editorial piece is?  ""Jew wa soom wan to splain it to jew? ""

Dude there is a big difference between getting a government contract to perform a service, and receiving a grant or a bale out.  Yes, these News article which you fell for, (that makes you a what?) include in the total amount, the huge loan that Tesla paid back 10 years early and the US tax payer made 20 million in profits from.  
The big money goes to spacex for providing services.  SpaceX usually gets about half what their competitors get for performing the same services but they make it work cause they can. (lookup the COTS program and who got how much)  There again, the US tax payer, Makes Money having SpaceX provide services for YOU.  They did get 35 million to develop a methane vacuum engine and the got some to help with the Pad 39a to help with crew loading and support.  Spacex contribution was 60%.   Again this will save you money over hitching a ride with another country.  The ULA, that launches you military, and other government payloads get over 800 million a year even if they don't launch a party balloon.  Then they were charging 250 to 450 million per launch.  This has been going on since before the space shuttle retired.  So lets see, that 5.2 Billion just to keeps the lights on and a couple extra hundred million PER LAUNCH over what spacex is providing, which is another 4 billion.  (ULA is feeling the heat and lowering prices now and their subsidy is said to end in 2019)

Tesla has received over 4 billion dollars in government subsidies which is taxpayer money for free which is why they don't care about making a profit. They make enough money off us already. At least when a human crashes they are held accountable in a court of law. Tell me when a autopiloted tesla kills someone, which will inevitably happen if it hasn't already, will tesla be held accountable?",0.7549,148
"_""Yes teslas are like tanks considering they weight as much as a dump truck.""_

Weight is only a concern for combustion cars where lower weight is preferred as it's an easy fix way to improve control which is then branded as 'sportiness' and provide better mileage.

Both of those do not apply to electric cars/Tesla. In fact, another significant advantage to having a heavier car is in the event of a collision, you'd be much safer in the heavier car.

(Source - https://www.technologyreview.com/s/413018/laws-of-physics-persist-in-crashes-big-cars-win/)

_""Tesla has received over 4 billion dollars in government subsidies which is taxpayer money for free which is why they don't care about making a profit.""_

Taxpayer money is often spent in copious amounts on the stupidest shit & no one bats an eye. I wonder why some tiny %age going towards making a better future for our children is a problem? Besides, nothing ever comes for free. Tesla is providing employment to ~33,000 U.S. citizens & also has their crazy $5 Billion Gigafactory project underway in Nevada which is 5.8 million square feet in size and the second largest building in the world by total square footage of over 13 million which'll provide even more jobs. Instead of shamelessly outsourcing everything to other countries.

_""They make enough money off us already.""_

Trust me, if profits were indeed their top priority, things will be much different. Model S @ $80K is a bargain. They've been making EVs now for quite a while & yet no one has dared to provide them with competition. That in itselves, is enough proof that making EVs is NOT profitable at all. Even Tesla has realized his & have merged with SolarCity to provide additional sources of income instead of jacking up prices or follow unethical behaviour like charging unscrupulous amounts for replacement parts/repairs/accessories like how car manufacturers & dealerships charge $500 to replace the key nowadays which is made in China for $10 and should be sold at $30.

_""At least when a human crashes they are held accountable in a court of law. Tell me when a autopiloted tesla kills someone, which will inevitably happen if it hasn't already, will tesla be held accountable?""_

That's an ongoing ethical debate for artificial intelligence in general. Look at it this way, most of the money today is held with banks digitally, supported by computer code & encryption. A simple bug could erase everything causing massive chaos & an apocalyptic scenario within an instant and we'd be sent back to the 50s. Ultimately, it's about trust & having fail-safes. And since self-driving cars are fairly new, it's okay to be skeptical of them as they haven't really had the chance to prove their mettle. However that doesn't mean that we shouldn't give it a fair, unbiased chance. Remember, when the Wright brothers invented the modern airplane, paving the path towards faster & cheaper air travel, people took them for idiots with too much time on their hands. With time, we've now become oblivious of the fact that how crazy it is that we can fly thousands of feet in the air & get wherever we want to in the world within hours & still be in one piece. Eventually, self-driving cars, inevitably, will become oblivious as well.

Oh and to answer your question, I suppose there'll be a proper investigation in the event that Autopilot is suspected of killing a human. There's a camera inside of the car recording the driver's actions in their newer Model 3. Hence everything is being logged. And these logs will be properly analyzed in court to determine if the driver is at fault or not. If not, then Autopilot's code will be examined and if it was a general mistake the software did or if something (sensors for eg.) malfunctioned & what lead to this mistake being made. If it's something that's deliberately obvious & should've been corrected by Tesla then they'll be charged since that'd imply that there was some problem with the fundamental code, which is made by Tesla. It'll be as fair as it should be. This has already happened btw. As you can tell, Tesla has already been sued & received a ton of trash talk about Autopilot.

Lastly I'd mention the inspiration for the name 'Autopilot'. As you can tell it comes from today's airplanes having the ability to piloit themselves, potentially risking hundreds of lives & millions of dollars. And this has in practice for decades now, and is touted as actually being safer & faster than human pilots, as also depicted in the movie Sully based on a real life incident.",0.1117,878
