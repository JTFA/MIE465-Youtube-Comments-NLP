"He apologized profusely. He then wrote an album about how sorry he was, and that album went to #1. America has forgiven him. It was a terrible thing to say, but he's done his time. It's old news. Let's move on from it already",0.0644,52

"I just saw Mayer play with Dead & Company in Detroit!¬†

Everyone in the audience that I met agreed: Let Mayer play guitar, but someone, PLEASE tell him to stop singing. He did not add any swampiness or folksy-twang to his vocals, and everyone watching him that night suffered for it. He was far too Berkley-jazzy when he crooned throughout the night.",-0.4665,70
"I loved JM when he first came into the scene...then he became a womanizing douche BUT from his past exes all have said what Katy says and I applaud that because he sings what he knows and vice versa.

"Robert.. he was obviously kidding.. he didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.. so he joked and said himself.. which is the opposite of a ""douchebag""",0.6288,31
So glad you got a haircut!!!!!!! Looking handsome,0.8253,11
"Someone expressing self-love, whether it's a joke or not, is not narcissistic or douchey - it's actually quite cool. The people whining that he said he was his own best lover are ignoring the fact that it would have been way more inappropriate and 'douchey' to actually name someone, like Katy did. 

Also, I'm glad i'm not the kind of person to to get hung up on something a celebrity said SEVEN YEARS AGO. Are you guys 13 years old?",0.9286,90

What he said was extremely rude and inappropriate but i never thought of it as racist; some of his biggest idols are black and he constantly works with other  black artists; steve jordan and david ryan harris among others. Add the fact that he's really close friends with Dave Chappelle,-0.473,53

"ever joked with your buff and thought it was super hilarious but nobody laughed. just you and your friend. happens a lot to me and my bff. again, not your tribe!!!! no reason to be a douchebag and call HIM names, especially not when he refused to. Like really ladies!?! that was handled like a dream. instead of talking shit, he kept it to ¬†himself and thought, if anyone is going to get laughed ¬†at, it's me. that's fucking mature. and if you don't like it whyyyyyy the fuck are you commenting? what's the purpuse",0.9818,114
