The reason the microphone doesn’t pick up sound is because it uses an air right bubble to feel vibrations when you vacuumed out the bubble the mic cannot work. Cody’s lab did an experiment where he put his camera in a vacuum chamber and he explained this concept. I am not sure if the speaker does the same.,-0.2411,65
