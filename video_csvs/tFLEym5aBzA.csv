He refused to listen to the judge, the woman in authority and was speaking very disrespectfully to her and almost as though he thought he was in charge- pretty much ignoring her and telling her what to do.  Everyone in that room had a story, a vendetta against Nassar, and his lack of self control was pretty immature and borderline toxic masculinity/sexism IMO. He obviously traumatized his daughter even further in those moments because in those moments she probably felt fear for her father's safety, empathy for his feelings, and maybe guilt for feeling like it was maybe her fault since she just gave testimony (even though it wasn't of course, but those feelings would be natural).",-0.3716,153

She said she doesn't believe in iPhone and I, but yet because she understands his frustration she allowed the illegal action to have occurred without any consequence. I'm not saying that I disagree with the guy emotionally. However, first of all I wouldn't have had my daughter in that predicament. Secondly, if it DID somehow happen, I would have taken the law into my own hands a long time ago knowing fully well what the consequences were.

The judges remarks tell me that she doesn't understand his position. She is sympathetic and empathetic to this father but not really understanding.

Nassar was compliant throughout the trial.
He plead guilty 
The judge on the other hand paraded over 150 girls throughout the trial in an unnecessary display of judicial over reach for the press.
She was simply securing her elected position for the future in a nauseating show for the uneducated.

So what did we learn about this?
That Nassar was a bad man?
That's about it!

We really need to find out how a brilliant young boy turned into the monster he became so maybe we can prevent future incidents.
Then society can maybe have real judges not phony publicity seekers and compassion lacking people like her and maybe we can go to bed at night wanting help for all of society not just a cherry picked few.
But that won't happen will it.
