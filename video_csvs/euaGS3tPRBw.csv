"For all you jerkoffs who are blind to the satire in this clip here is a little guide:

Jon Stewart represents most people and how we talk most of the time.
 
Stephen Colbert represents SJWs and how easily triggered they are about the smallest and stupidest things in existence and completely overreact .

idk what John Oliver represents yet

Samantha Bee represents third wave feminists and how they sensitive they are and how they overreact to tiny stupid things.

Now do you see how they are actually satirizing the far left and regressive left?

"Show indirectly explained the difference between a democrat & a republican. Touting how great it was  a girl with autism who is unable to speak, was able to fulfill her dream of hosting a talk show non-verbally. When time came for her to interview Colbert, her autism ""tick"" struck and she picked up confetti instead. A democrat thinks about how great it is a handicap does not stop her from her dream, given the right contact and $$$$.. A republican just tells it like it is, HER CONDITION MAKES IT SO SHE CANT NOW OR EVER HOST, THERE IS NO POINT MAKING HER BELIEVE IN A FANTASY. I understand ""make a wish"" , but not giving a handicap person a career requiring skills they dont possess, its actually cruel. I cant play pro-basketball, i dont bitch.",0.268,156
