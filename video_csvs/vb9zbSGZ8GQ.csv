Everybody got something to say but we don't know the whole story as a black man I don't agree with him getting mad about something like this but I can see where he coming from the only black dude on the team is Black History Month it's all about showing love letting people know that this month is not in vain in American notices but like I said I wouldn't be upset about so stop with all the hate comment we all got to live on this planet together it's all about trying to understand one another and even if you don't it's okay but stop with the hate making a mountain out of a hill once again I don't agree with him plus I don't think white people can ever truly understand black people vice versa but trying to get a alone and understanding one another without hate is the key peace Love happiness,0.5597,155

That dude needs to grow a pair and not get offended at everything with his double standard. He wouldnt be saying that its unfair if he WON, but the second he looses its unfair.",-0.9771,122
