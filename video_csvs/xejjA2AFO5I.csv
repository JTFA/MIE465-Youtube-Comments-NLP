If you've seen 'The Road', they're going for that type of narrative, in which I would say the black & white scheme they're trying to portray didn't quite permeate with me. What was lacking was pure CONTENT. Emotion was clearly there, but I left with the feeling of... ok? I guess the protagonist was both empathetic towards providing hope towards her comrades but at the same time... I dunno. 'Fucking mechanical dogs' is what i'm basing my opinions on.",0.8639,103

"Any of the movements Metalhead can do can also be done by machines we have now, what we don't have is autonomous control, even the most autonomous vehicles we have like drones and self driving cars either require a human to do most of the work or can only be trusted to do a very limited number of things when no human is around.

But AI and autonomy comes from increasing what a machine knows and that is being done all the time by teaching them..

"Have to say I was quite disappointed with this episode. Thought of a way of doing this survival type episode, in my opinion better.

Could've started off with scientists discovering a new ""tech drug"" called ""Antibodies"" which are microscopic robots i guess in a way, that are injected into your blood system and can be programmed to fight off any virus/disease/cancer your body is inflicted with. Then after being a huge success for a while something goes wrong or the ""Antibodies"" can be hacked and cause that person to do things they don't want to or become a zombie like state if they eat away at the body from the inside etc.

Also the end is a shit and i dont undersrand it at all. What is the explanation?? They dont explain anything. Who was she speaking withon the walky? Why were they risking their lifes there? Why those 3???? What relate them?? When it finished it seemed to me like if it had a second part... but they couldnt afford it so they didnt do it.

"This Black Mirror episode is by far...the worst!  It could have been so much more.  Instead, the writer decided to go with the played-out and predictable formula that is an homage to the misogynistic perpetuation of female stereotypes.   How many chances did the main character have to stop her pursuer while it was incapacitated or vulnerable?  And the dripping blood...really?  The wounds weren't deep enough to produce a never-ending trail of blood.  Was she a hemophiliac that couldn't produce a clot?  How stupid do you presume your audience to be?  The teddy bears.  Something three people would die for and numerous people would encourage them to give their lives for?  Maybe a liver or a heart would have been slightly more plausible.  This episode should never have been considered for production.  I wish I had that time back.",-0.9161,156

I never said it didn't have substance. I said that it was so full of nothingness that you could follow the entire story while scrolling through the whole thing. You're being apologetic for it and suggesting I'm braindead for pointing out its flaws.

"What a Weirdo. 
Oh whoops, my bad. I guess I was just confused because usually tension makes me feel... tense. Not bored and angry.

Darn, I guess if I don't enjoy incompetent writing and dragged out scenes that don't aid the plot in any way... that just means I'm brain dead. Shoot. Well then I guess this episode was brilliant and totally wasn't written by someone who gets spoon fed num nums from an air-rooo-playnee.

""Ok girl go get box. But robot find her. Then she run away. But robot find her. Then she run away. But robot find her. Then she run away. But robot find her. Then she shoot roblotx. Then she die. Box had bear in it. ALL DONE!""",-0.9725,147
"What a Weirdo. 
Yeah I understand the obvious premise of the episode. I'm saying the writing, pacing, and delivery were all shit. And in what way was anything subtle? They literally showed the girl fumbling through every simple task. There was nothing that happened off camera that was to be implied. I mean shit, they even spoon fed you the robots decision making process taking away any potential suspense there. I guess the whole ""the dying person was a kid"" thing? That was more of a reveal than something subtle. And the only emotion they showed was ""I'M SCARED"" it wasn't exactly self reflecting commentary on the human psyche. ""Oh the whole thing was because she feels bad for a kid"" gee wizz... what a deep reflection of human emotions... they sure were brave to tackle that topic... And calling it  ""survival horror"" ? Okaaay... how? In what way? Because she was trying to... survive? Like in literally every scary film ever? That's not even a film genre, it's a gaming genre. Did she craft a weapon? Did she build a shelter? No? None of that? Then what the hell are you talking about?

Personal attacks are less fun than actually analyzing the content, but here's some anyways.

I think you're a simple person, with a simple mind, and simple tastes. That's why you enjoyed this simple story. You're like why minions are popular. Or why they made an emoji movie. So you can stare vacantly at the moving pictures and mash your ham hocks together cheering because it stimulated the two receptors you have floating around in your lard soaked brain. You're so used to not having to think hard that you perceive poorly executed obvious trash as something subtle and deep. Ya suck, kid. Take a lap.",0.5341,349

The main character explicitly said the other people said they shouldn't go, but she went anyway because she cared enough about the dying kid to try and find something to comfort him before he dies, and based on the fact that they hotwired a van, they likely went to pick up other supplies too. The dogs were obviously powerful machines, and she rightly feared them, as did the other characters. They have a variety of ways of killing people so I don't get why you think she shouldn't be cautious around it, even when it looks like its safe to go. That's not even going into the social commentary in this episode,  but by the looks of things you don't seem to give a fuck about that.",-0.0651,150
