"*sigh*, There's plenty of reasons for female athletes trying NOT to do triple axles. In figure skating, just as in ballet, female performers (whose routine is more graceful) go after a leaner, lighter physical build; whereas men (who do all the lifting and such) have to develop a sturdier build. Making the jump takes a lot of strength, yes, but it's the landing that's most costly. I think I heard one of the commentators say it was a landing of about 500 pounds-force? Not having sturdy enough muscle to sustain that could end in irreversible injury. So there ya go.",-0.611,119

Asian French Asian Africans etc. How bout African American. African Australian  African Pakistani. We are the only country in the world that claims to be unified as one yet we label ourselves in division. Asian Americans don't seem to be thought of as Americans.
