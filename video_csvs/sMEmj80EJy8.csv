"Hey Madelynn, I'm just curious to know how many mm your nose-ring is?",0.3182,15
"Hey to answer your question: creative displacement is so important. I remember watching your videos back when you were in school still, and i sort-of saw this transition you're talking about where your videos went from playful to professional (still fantastic of course, i understand the change) So you should ABSOLUTELY pick up a hobby that's just for you. Something you don't have to share and just do for sheer enjoyment. By expanding your brain with different creative projects you'll feel less pigeonholed for sure. I do this with writing and painting- when one isn't working for me i just switch for a day or two. Super beneficial, and finding new exciting hobbies is the best part of life tbh.",0.9856,133
"Hi Madelynn! One important thing I've learned about myself is that my body sends me signals when I'm unhappy or blocking myself in some way. Those signals tell me that I need to stop and take stock, prioritize and then go from there. Every time I do this my mood improves, I feel more energized and productive.
BTW: My favorite series of yours is Girl Friday.",0.5974,74
"Hi Madelynn. I learned recently the hard way that we all need to have balance between the right and left sides of the brain. So what I'm referring to is creativity (right) and logic (left). Much of the world today is uneasy because of too much logic and thinking things through. There are also drawbacks of only creating and expressing yourself, even though that sounds weird and wrong. If you find that you engage in too much right side brain habits, you have to remind yourself to stay grounded with left side habits. Anyway, balance is key!!",-0.2924,112

"I would be so excited to see your film! You are a gem of a creative, I feel like we would be friends IRL. I went through a breakup this year too and I learned to stand up for myself more.

That is one of my favorite movies of all time I saw it in the theater when I was a young girl. Robert Altman directed it. I've probably seen it about 20-30 times and every time I watch it I get a different sense of something out of it. Pinky the character of Sissy Spacek wants to be like Millie she adores her and she even kind of like if you notice on that one scene with Edgar she laughs just like Milly. The only part that puzzled me was pinkies parents when she tried to kill herself in the swimming pool what she acting like she didn't know them or were they truly not her parents I never got that part. And if you noticed throughout the movie Shelley Duvall's character always has her clothes or jacket in the door of the car what do you think of that,0.9231,155
The consciousness and self-awareness can be extended to literally every aspect of your life and even though they create inordinate amounts of anxiety they also allow you to make decisions about how you want to proceed and there is immense power in that. The ability to make a decision (in accordance with or despite various emotional truths) =personal power!,0.5787,64
The most important thing that I‚Äôve learned is that I can say NO to people without feeling guilty after. I wasn`t able to say no before and ended up always doing things that I didn`t want to. I was always afraid to hurt other peoples feelings so I was always hurting mine.,-0.7988,61
"This year I began my journey of recovering from anorexia, depression, and anxiety. It was so terrifying to put life on hold, step away from school, and what I'm ""supposed"" to be doing.

I've learned to challenge systemic conventions that plague us all, and put myself and my needs first.",-0.7991,79

In the same time I was fired from my old job and I was so happy because I wasn't able to fire myself. I was so scared of life than. I thought I don't have any perspective. But I always believed in power of Universe. And I realized that Universe won't give me anything if I don't do something. You always have to change something, prove that you care.
