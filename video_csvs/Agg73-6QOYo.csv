"How about those Titans?! The Man does it again (Mariota). To the casual fan their eyes go straight to his rough 2017 TD/INT numbers but stop there. Yes those are obviousy down for him, be it because of injuries, play-calling and/or just plain bad luck. But those don't even tell close to the whole story, this can be seen clearest in Pro Football Focus' advanced stats QB Grade Rankings, in those stats they have him ranked as the 7th best QB this season, the numbers show just what a crazy season it's been for him and just how unlucky he has been.  Because he had 84.0 passer rating vs. pressure, which was good for 3rd best in the league, 7th in 'Turnover-worthy Throw % at 2.5% and most amazing of all was the fact that he ranked #1 in Big-Time Throw % at 7.7% which was head and shoulders above the rest of the league and the second best wasn't even close with Alex Smith ranked #2 at 6.8% & Carson Wentz #3 at 6.5%. So what do those stats mean? Well I imagine the Big-Time Throw % & Passer Rating vs. Pressure both speak for themselves and turnover-worthy throws mean in order for his Interceptions to be as high as they were he had to have pretty horrible luck as nearly almost every turnover-worthy throw he made was turned into an interception. But let's put that stuff aside and get back to the performance and leadership he put up in his first playoff game, going down 14 points in the first quarter and losing 21-3 at the half they could have succumb to all the talk this week that they had no chance, that they didn't deserve to even be in the playoffs, but he wouldn't let them. That's not who he is. Afterall despite their struggles Mariota still led the NFL in both Comeback Wins and Game Winning Drives and HE DID IT AGAIN (With Derrick Henry even though out of nowhere he had more fumbles in this game than he had in his entire NFL career up to that point). I'm just glad Mariota finally got to show what he (and the Titans) can do to the entire nation. As people who haven't watched him much or at all just assume he is like almost every other fast QB to come into the league, that he just looks to run and isn't a good passer, but with Mariota it's the other way around, he's really an excellent passer who just happens to be the fast player at his position in the league, usually only taking off when there is no one open. Oh yeah one more thing, How Bout That Block to Seal the Game? That wasn't your average QB block.",0.9948,516
