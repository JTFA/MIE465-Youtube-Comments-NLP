‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to miss you as an angel (But I‚Äôll still be your best friend...) Thank you for everything you have done for Victoria‚Äôs Secret for the past 17 angelic years.... You‚Äôll always be there for us. But for me, You‚Äôll always be my best friend.... VS ‚ù§Ô∏è you, Ale and I ‚ù§Ô∏è you so much, Ale.‚Äù 

Afterwards, Alessandra Ambrosio gave me a hug while I was crying at the end and she said to me ‚ÄúI‚Äôll miss you too, Chris.... I ‚ù§Ô∏è U, always, Meu melhor amigo!‚Äù

BTW, Her departure from Victoria‚Äôs Secret as an Angel is NOT the end of my friendship with her.... It just the beginning.",0.8687,187

The fact that you know I'm Black and I have REPEATEDLY asked you not to use the word and yet you STILL did it, tells me everything I need to know about your character and education. This is why I don't waste my time arguing with idiots. Even had I wasted the time explaining it to you, you'll still CHOOSE to use a racial slur for the purposes of offending others. You know it's wrong and yet you still choose to use it. What a true you are :) And I must note, you have not seen me type the word. I have continuously written ""the n-word"", yet you and all your glorious privilege (and racism) did it anyway. I can tell how proud of yourself you are. Congratulations! You said it! All is right in your world! Isn't it great? (If you can't tell, that's sarcasm. Look it up while you're researching Sociology and History at your local library). ¬†I'll pray for you.

"Anneke Dalton I do know why people consider ot racist, that's pretty obvious, what I don't understand is why if it's so bad black people use it as a way to call each other friend... that's what no one gets, you shouldn't have to censor yourself because of your race, if the word is so awful, which I believe it is, then everyone should stop using it, not just white people and regardless of your race you shouldn't use racial slurs...",-0.9017,90
"Anneke Dalton I put equal in quotation marks not because I disagree, but because people like YOU try to preach about equality yet insist in making differences based on each other's races, THAT'S not equality, but it IS what you preach... racism will not be over unless people like you stop making differences based on races, if black people can do something and be considered normal then white people should be able to do it too...",-0.3309,82
"Anneke Dalton I'm just asking, if the word is awful and a racial slur then WHY can a race use it in a possible way, but another one can't, even when it's in the same context??

"Anneke Dalton I'm not comfortable with someone being racist, but that has nothing to do with this, I'm asking you WHY when white people use it it's racist, but when black people do it's considered normal or even friendly sometimes, why don't you answer that basic question??",-0.7106,53
"Anneke Dalton and I NEVER said having black friends meant you could use racial slurs, but of course you never bothered to read my comment, what I DID say is that if black people think it's so offensive then why do they keep using it too?? If it's a racial slur then no one should say it, if when black people say it it's considered normal then it should be considered the same when white people say it, since we are all ""equal""",-0.7155,91

"Anneke Dalton and it's not that I want or need to use a racial slur, it's just that sometimes you get caught in the moment and want to sing along, you can't just censor people based on their race, that's racism too...",-0.4703,46
"Anneke Dalton and maybe it's so hard to understand because not even you people fucking explain it, you just say ""you are racist"" or ""that's offensive"" but keep using it as a way to call each other friends...",-0.6037,44

"Anneke Dalton can you imagine what a huge scandal would be made if white people suddenly said ""black people can't say this word or do this"", they would be called racist and ignored, but when white people say nigga they are seen as the bad guy, why do you get offended when someone forbids you to do something because of your race yet insist on doing the same to others, and since you are a minority you think it's all right??",-0.9326,89
"Anneke Dalton first of all I'm mot white, but of course you assume everyone who doesn't agree with you has to be white... and I'm not fighting for my right to offend anyone, what I'm saying is that as long as you are not using it to offend anyone then why can't you use it? Why do people think the meaning is different when white people say it than when black people say it even when the context is the same?? The women on this video are not making any racial differences between them, they are just singing, and hanging out with black models as well, but obviously you wouldn't understand that for racims to truly be over we have to stop making differences between black and white and stop trying to forbid an entire race from saying or doing something.",-0.8014,151

If you are one of the people who preach against racism and say ""we are all equal"" but still try to forbid an entire race of saying a word even if it's in a non-insulting way then you are part of the problem, people should be judged based on their actions and personality, not by their race... and if you are personally offended by the word nigga then maybe you should also rant against black people saying it...",-0.9794,176
