I‚Äôm calling on you to work with your colleagues to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a ""resolution of disapproval"" reversing the FCC's vote. 
„ÄÄ
The FCC's Dec. 14 decision willfully ignored the outcry from tens of millions of people, and it abdicated the FCC's responsibility to protect the internet from ISP blocking and discrimination. The FCC has injured our economy and free speech in just one action, all without so much as a single public hearing. 
„ÄÄ
We need members of Congress to stand up for the open internet and for the digital civil rights of their constituents now. Please use the CRA to pass a Resolution of Disapproval to overturn the FCC's December 14 ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" vote.

"The entire mess with the FCC is based on one important principle which nobody in government is willing to tell you: THE FCC DOES NOT OWN ANYTHING!   It is not empowered to give anything away which belongs to the American people.  That's right.  Long ago, it was decided that all of these things belong to the American people and NOT to government. The FCC is only the holder of radio waves, TV, and now the Internet.  FCC merely holds these things in TRUST!  They watch over and protect these things for WE THE PEOPLE!.  The Federal Communications Commission was designed to protect our property from exactly what is now happening.  

Unfortunately, the American people seem to have totally forgotten this.

Government does not own these things.  They have no power to GIVE these important assets to the enemy.  And these giant ISPs are the enemy.  Internet Service Providers my ass!  After all, Comcast has a history of abusing its customers.   Stealing and exploiting their customers.  

""Get back in line!  I will call you when I am good and ready.  (Here she allows an evil little smile.)  And I have a 20 minute break coming up right now.""
I know this because I was once a customer of Comcast.  I saw how they treat people.  I didn't know it then, but I began to get the picture in my own way and through my own experience:  Comcast is the most hated corporation in all the world!   (except for Monsanto. But that's another story.)

Back to the FCC and Ajit Pai.  It has been a long time since I studied Mass Communication but when I was in college this is how things stood.  A strong  FCC granted licences and told stations what they could and couldn't do on behalf of the American people.  Now it seems the FCC's only job is to decide which gigantic corporation to hand over the Internet to for profit.",0.5344,365

"What a joke.  So the Internet is going to go back to the way it was before 2015 (wow, 2 whole years ago), and that's going to make it worse?  Oh yeah, remember how bad the Internet was just 2 years ago?  Oh, that's right, Beme News didn't exist because Beme was still an app being written by Casey's company.  Oh yeah, that was so horrible.

All these ""what if"" scenarios about how ISPs are going to charge us for every little think have no basis in reality.  They weren't doing it in the years leading up to 2015, they aren't going to do it by rolling net neutrality back.

Gimme a break.  The Internet wasn't broken before the Obama FCC decided to exceed their authority and reclassify ISPs as a public utility.  It isn't going to be broken by reclassifying them as non public utilities and then allow Congress to tell the FCC to reclassify if that's what Congress (ya know, the people who are actually in charge of making and changing laws) decides to do.

I normally love Beme News, but your last few videos have a really bad ""CNN bent"".  Maybe try just reporting the news (yes, that is possible) and leave the commentary for the other millions of people that have already one videos on the topic.  Your hurricane videos were fantastic.

"you all think the internet is dead but nothing is permanent take that any way you like. but  we can get it if we the people on all sides fight for it and put decent people in power, people who got no hidden agenda. i was a league of legend player until very recently i  had a game where  all the guard  towers were gone and our base was open for the picking  i was never that good, but my team came together  fought our way to victory. the point we all have a battle ahead of us , we have fight  make them pay for every step they take . make them pay for that  and win. unlike you  ""pussies"" i will fight and try take as many out metaphoically as i can   before i get killed and try to correct the mistake.  this just a suggestion a free internet is worth fighting for      check it  and think about it",-0.974,170
