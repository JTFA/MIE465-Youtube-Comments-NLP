1. Japanese women
2. Car Culture; particularly the underground aspects of it: Roulettezoku, Tougezoku, zero-yon, dori, et cetera. I wish there was an Upgarage here in the US. I still have some parts and shopping bags from times when I was living there. 

The other things are simple like the arcades and conbini food like onigiri. I also enjoyed hanging out at bookstores and reading manga.",0.8555,91

"The thing I love about Japanese car culture, is that there doesn't seem to be much judgement. In the US, you put leds on a car and you're considered a ""ricer"", but the fact of the matter is, in the US if you do something that isn't common place on a non-exotic car, it is judged harshly. In Japan I feel like everyone respects each others individual styles, and I'm envious of that.
