Not surprising from someone who admitted he didn't actually read himself the crucial pieces of information to his own memo, the FISA warrant applications! 1:01

10:05 The Russians called (classified) Carter Page a ""USEFUL idiot"", not just ""an idiot"" (the same category they have for Old Man Trump). Another small, but important (and telling) lie of omission by the Trump lapdog.

So, in classic Trumpy style, AS DESCRIBED BY HIM, IN HIS OWN BOOK, whenever he is under fire, he HITS BACK, so as soon as he realised he was under investigation, he started HIS OWN investigation into the people (and entire departments!) investigating HIM! (if you're gonna lie, LIE BIGly!)
  Classic discrediting technique, same as shouting ""fake news"" at every story that tells the truth about unsavoury or damaging aspects of his character / policies / administration / friends / ties / interests - and the MAGA morons, obviously, buy it hook, line and sinker. Smart people can see through his weak, transparent game, of course.

 So, then, Nunes: Trump's useful idiot - but, like a lesser quality copy in Multiplicity, (this shitshow's movie will probably be called Multi-Duplicity when it gets made 7-8 years from now) when you're a useful idiot's useful idiot, you're really JUST an idiot.",0.9892,343

"Nunes job is to represent his constituents. He is a Representative for a district in CA and works in the House of Representatives, which is part of the Legislative branch.

... and yet, here he is spending all his time (for the past year, mind you) doing the bidding of the President, who leads the Executive branch.

The Legislation and Judicial branches are supposed to be checks on the Executive branch. So yeah, this isn't rocket science, Nunes is not only refusing to do his job by representing the interests of those in his district, but he is also undermining the Constitution itself, which couldn't be clearer on the three SEPARATE branches of government and how absolutely vital it is for them to check each other. 

The purpose of these checks is to prevent corruption and to prevent the consolidation of power... which is exactly why Trump is attacking it. He wants his branch of government, the Executive branch, to rule the others, even though we would have to burn our Constitution and create a completely new one to make that possible.",0.2059,202

Lmao, you are quite stupid.  The guy who literally wrote the memo even said it really doesn't mean much.  He said the Steele dossier was started by Republicans (which it was) and that it was not the reason the surveillance was approved, which is also true.  

Tell me, what exactly does this memo prove?  Since you seem so confident answer me that.  What in this memo proves that the FBI has some grand bias against trump that they illegally surveilled his campaign?  What evidence in this memo is there that would actually somehow discredit Robert mueller?

You are a sheep of all sheep.  Incapable of thinking.  You want so badly for the Trump-Russia campaign to be false because Fox wants it to be.  The facts speak for themselves.  Frankly I don't give a damn if the FBI tied trump's family up and tortured them until they gave them the truth.  All I care about is the facts.  And the fact is there is evidence to charge multiple members of Trump's campaign team with crimes involving Russian foreign agents.  Doesn't matter how the evidence came about.  

The only people who attack the ones charging them with crimes are the ones who can't argue the evidence.  If Trump's team was actually innocent, they'd be providing proof, not trying to discredit the evidence against them.  It's classic lawyer strategies.  Evidence too strong? Force a mid-trial.  But America isn't falling for it.  Hell even Fox News isn't going too hard into this memo because they know there's barely anything there.

But you keep believing that only trump and his trusted allies tell the truth.  That 80% of the world is lying because only a small fraction is telling the truth on this one.

"explain yourself. Or do you not realize that there have been multi points of contact with the Russians within Trump's campaign? Flynn admits to having contact and lying about it. Papadopoulos admits to lying to the FBI about Russian contacts and admits to lying about it. Sessions had to recuse himself because he was caught lying about Russian contact. Manafort is under investigation for money laundering (doing alot of business in Russia and Ukraine) and lying to the FBI. Other points of Russian contact include Kushner. If anything, Nune's memo solidifies the investigation. It shows that the FBI had warned Page about Russian interest in his person three years before the Trump campaign. Three years, chief. The memo also discloses that after the FBI warned Page about the Russians, he continued to interact with known Russian spies. The memo also states the FBI obtained three FISA(by federal judge) warrants after the initial authorization to put survelliance on Page. Not to mention both Australian intelligence and British intelligence flagging Page as a possible Russian spy. So there was sufficient legal cause to put surveillance on a very possible Russian spy. So not only did the Trump campaign harbor a possible spy but Donny Jr. openly admitting to attempting to illegally gather dirt on Clinton through Russian officials. We just have to take his word that no transaction/deal took place. So all this is a big coincidence I guess, with no probable cause for investigation? Alright there chief, keep that blindfold snug.",-0.797,281

"jensen1901 Yes and yes. If u have read the memo you know that it is a fact. You can't say oh the document is an opinion or GPS Fusion is an opinion or whatever. You can argue that it does not lead to anything guilty or any special impact as the Republicans have emphasized, but you cannot say that the document itself is an opinion because every single event and company and evidence is real and legit. Now if you do want to keep saying it is fake, give me your source and YOUR FACTS to prove it wrong. And excuse me, are you discriminating my race? Isn't that, according to your logic, racist, fascist and white supremacist? Oh wait, if that is the case since you are racist fascist and white supremacist, you have no voice, you can't have any opinion because they must be racist fascist and white supremacist. Oh no.",-0.9925,172
