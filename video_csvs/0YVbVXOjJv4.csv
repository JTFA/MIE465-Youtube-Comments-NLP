"#StevenTylerPedophile
 The Kia Stinger commercial has Steven Tyler in it. Why in this day and age would Kia want a Pedophile be in an ad to promote their car?

"Congratulations Kia on PBS MotorWeek making the Stinger car of the year.
Though it doesn't surprize me one  bit.
Beautiful automobile on all fronts.
And engineering to match from the most innovative full line auto manufacturers....in my humble opinion.
I drive a 2012 Soul basic....with a few practical mods. (16x6 alloys. K&N filtration, but pretty much stock.
97k on the clock and three pedals on the floor like god intended, and as tight as the day I brought him home.
The gearbox has one of the niced gear changes.  Just a joy in the twistys and flawless to this day.
When asked,  I often compare it to my 1971 BMW 2002.
Another car that does everything well. Both Tan. Btw. 
And as nice as the current Soul is....I'm looking to hold on to my 2012 for another 97k! 
Cuz for me, it's practically perfect in everyday.
So I'm a fan that has watched you from your beginings in the US.
My dealings with your representatives over the years have been nothing short of a pleasure.
And finally.... my father insisted fought on your behalf to keep South Korea free. It's good to see a nation that takes that and they do something with it.
And in my opinion Kia along with Hyundai our perfect example of that.
