Juan Velez exactly. She has influence and she uses it to bring awareness. Don’t sit there and judge when clearly u don’t know anything about her either. Hypocrite. Her fans know her better than anyone.,0.6808,44
"Juan Velez no hun you can't judge no one not because they are famous or not famous. BC celebs are humans they feel just like us and the reason she became famous is for her fans and music to be heard not to forget she does charity a lot and she uses her biggest platform for good causes she made a change something you haven't even tried to do, besides sit on your couch stalk her latest news to try and tear her down, sadly for you she doesn't care about you .... I highly suggest you stop the negativity and spread love & kindness enough with the hatr already and if you still feel negative towards people you don't even know and hate em because they are celebs and better than you well darling I suggest you get mental help and I hope it will help you 🙏",0.88,152
