"Dear Friends Jesus Christ wants a deep relationship with you. He love you SO much. Give your life to Him today and make Him your Lord and Savior. When we are in love with our Lord, obedience doesn't cost us a thing. Stagnation in our spiritual life comes when we say we will bear all of our problems ourselves. We cannot. When we are faithful to the total goals of God, the moment we obey Him, He can move mountains in our lives, wash us clean and make us anew. Let go of the world and let God, through Jesus Christ, be the head of your life. It will be the greatest decision you will ever make. John 3:16. ❤️❤️❤️",0.9761,141

"Pryme Tyme so what does bussing back have to do with being a rat. Where are you people from???? SUBURBS.
When he bussed back you acting like he hit something. Tax told this kid and every rapper, I can say what I want to say but don’t try and hurt me or it’s going down. People know how Tax gets down in Brooklyn, so for Troy going to approach him for a fist fight already lets me know this guy has never been in any type of war. Troy knows if he goes to prison he’s done for coz tax and cass have them jails on lock, this is why he’s testifying. ‘Gangsta + talking to feds = SNITCH",-0.9631,140

"There is no video evidence of the altercation. Only of Troy chasing someone who appears to be Tax and firing wrecklessly in a crowded area. Because someone else snitched makes it ok for him to snitch? And he hasn't taken the stand YET because the trial hasn't started yet.
