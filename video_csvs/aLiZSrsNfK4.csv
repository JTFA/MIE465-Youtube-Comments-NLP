"Dear Friends Jesus Christ wants a deep personal relationship with you. He loves you SO much. Give your life to Him today and make Him your Lord and Savior. When we are in love with our Lord, obedience doesn't cost us a thing. Stagnation in our spiritual life comes when we say we will bear all of our problems ourselves. We cannot. When we are faithful to the total goals of God, the moment we obey Him, He can move mountains in our lives, wash us clean and make us anew. Let go of the world and let God, through Jesus Christ, be the head of your life. It will be the greatest decision you will ever make. ❤️❤️❤️ (Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9747,157
