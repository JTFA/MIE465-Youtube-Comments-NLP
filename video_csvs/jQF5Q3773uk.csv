The shills out there are quick to appease Apple by stating that this device has the best quality sound - It does not sound as good as the Google Home Max (its closest competitor price wise). Apple  failed to deliver the on smart part of these smart speakers and does not have the level of features nor IoT (or Smart home) integration that Google nor Amazon have amassed over the years.

"As a HomePod owner, it's becoming clearer to me, Apple developed the HomePod not to compete with other 'smart speakers, but as an audio accessory tailored to increase the value of Apple Music. This makes sense if Apple is trying to increase revenue for their services. Reviews do not compare other 'smart speakers' to HomePod's 7 unique features that have never been in a speaker before: 1.) Omnidirectional Listening 2.) Automatic re-tuning to custom location. 3.) Distortion free at any sound level 4.) Woofer enhanced travel model 5.) Computer chip sound processing 6.) Lush big sound for size 7.) Accessory to increase the value of a music service. If you compare competitor contributions to speaker technology, none of the competitors are doing this. The HomePod is not for you if you already have a speaker system. Rather the HomePod is targeted to a music (subscriber) lover purchasing their first speaker. ¬†One audience is larger than the other. In short, the technology works for you, rather than you working for the technology. Again, Apple demonstrates their ability to 'Think Differently.'.",0.9862,219

Sometimes, not always, when I ask Siri (homepod) to play something, the song plays from my iphone at the same time....annoying. ¬† As far as doing everything else, I still use Echo. ¬†Way better at almost everything. ¬†Homepod does a lot of cute stuff, when I ask for the weather, for example, like saying ""Brrrrrr, I think it's really cold out there, and then gives you a brief weather forecast which isn't as detailed as the echo's forecast. ¬†So aside from playing music, it's a waste of money. ¬†I still prefer my bose powered speakers. ¬† First apple product that I really wish I hadn't bought.",0.9847,248

I saw your first Review on this Apple Homepod and definitely Sound quality is good and built well.But I really think they have a work to do with security and some updates where Google products are a little smarter and the rest of speakers follow.Sono's is nice as well with quality and build quality and has just the right mix. I really think Google Speakers are the right mix but wish it had better Sound quality like these not that it's bad because you can pair to different devices as well.Also what makes this also difficult choice is their are so many out now and not all will like just this one unless they make some changes and updates.Awesome Review really enjoyed Deb.üëå‚úåÔ∏èüëç,0.9801,131

The core of Apple‚Äôs philosophy is to give you a tool.. then let you play. That was the first Mac and so was the iPhone... first questions were what can it do and why can‚Äôt it do this or that? Now 10 years of RND by consumers.. iPhone is still the best and ‚Äújust works‚Äù phone around.. all new phones have a glitch... if iPhone has a glitch it is fixed immediately. So in turn the HomePod is just that... a tool to play with... now the 2nd and 3rd gen will blow all the rest out of the water.. due to making sure it just works and not overextending with a lot of bells and whistles. So please stop being judgmental and look at the long view of the company‚Äôs core tenants... I hope this is taken as a comment in passing... I apologize if I‚Äôm seem overzealous at all.. just wish others would see what they do in the long view rather than short term band aid solutions that lead to batteries catching fire!,0.9433,202

perfect review,0.5719,2
recording the sound with a cameramic doesn't make any sense whatsoever.... to be analytical you need to record them with a referenced measurement mic at same position. Just saying,0.0,31

the problem is actually with Spotify and not Apple. Apps are able to add Siri integration and Spotify just hasn't done that.,-0.4019,24
the sound comparison with beats headphones is absolutely insane to listen to it sound like I'm listening to garbage for my ears when your comparing the home pod to any of these other devices the difference is astonishing like absolutely blows me away every time the video switches back to the homepod truly incredible,0.6003,54

what happened to apple. when Steve was in charge this would not have come to market in less it was better then what other brands had to offer. I think apple need to look at what they are doing and make some big changes or they wont be relevant in the next 10 years,0.3892,56

"you can hear better sub pronunciation and high frequencies at 1:40, probably heavier materials and build quality if its not rattling, youtube is only 192kbps, but i'm using a scarlett interface and open ear beyerdynamics. sounds pretty good, still a bit muddy 250hz.. -- edit apparently it tunes itself to the room, pretty cool idea",0.9542,63
