Could you do me a huge favor and sub to my channel? I have a little less than 850 subs and I am trying to reach 1000 before the new YouTube partner program kicks in and I am no longer allowed to monetize my videos. My channel is mainly guitar tutorials for new acoustic songs. If you need me to sub back to your channel I'd be more than happy to do so as well!,0.8607,79
