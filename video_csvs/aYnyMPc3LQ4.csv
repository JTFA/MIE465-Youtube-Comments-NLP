"Hey Jaiden, the video is a bit fast imo, I don’t have enough time to realize what you just said before you move on to the next one. A good example is when you did the thing with the man clicking out and you’re saying no wait I’ll go faster. The YouTube screen is brought up, I don’t realize what I’m seeing, so I also didn’t realize yet that he is clicking out, and so the joke wasn’t funny to me, I couldn’t take it, went over my head. I love videos that have cuts that don’t leave you bored too, but they need some pauses to let information sink in too. Please please don’t take this in any harsh way, I’m just trying to give constructive criticism. You should try to pace the videos in a natural pace and consider the speed in which the viewers will realize details about what they’re seeing or hearing, a viewer only focuses on one thing at a time, first I need to realize this is your YouTube video, then that the cursor is clicking out, then a pause for me to evaluate what you mean by showing somebody clicking out would be good, and the joke of you cutting that out and being like no no wait would have sunk properly.",0.8319,263
