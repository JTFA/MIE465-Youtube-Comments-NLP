But when its get higher (shutter speed) more that 1/250 - 1/8000 , you would use high speed sync to illuminate the subject.

I could not explain it in a way that others could understand, but this video makes it all clear. I was not wrong when I said ""it is probably just another sound in real time made to fit what you see happen in slow motion, or computer editing: see, ""The Matrix"", as that is full of slow motion with sound, as well as any other number of fighting scenes in martial arts movies... Ask your self this, have you ever heard the sound of a punch as what the movies portray a punch to sound like? No, you just heard the sound of a wet ham hitting the ground whenever you hit someone, instead of that cool ""PSH"" that is associated with punching that we hear watching those types of movies""....
