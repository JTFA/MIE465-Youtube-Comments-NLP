“I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic… [Capitalism] started out with a noble and high motive… but like most human systems it fell victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has out-lived its usefulness.” – Letter to Coretta Scott, July 18, 1952.

“And one day we must ask the question, ‘Why are there forty million poor people in America? And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth.’ When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I’m simply saying that more and more, we’ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society…” –Speech to Southern Christian Leadership Conference Atlanta, Georgia, August 16, 1967.

"Troy it is the fact communists use his words out of context to push the agenda that MLK supported their genocides. Communists are disingenuous and are the same cancer as nazism.

Justin, you are diseased cancer I just talked about taking everything out of context to further genocide, squalor, and hate. From the same letter you dipshit that you edited out maliciously

1. ""And yet I am not so opposed to capitalism that I have failed to see its relative merits""

2. asking questions of society means he was anti-capitalist? are you fucking retarded.

3. He preached to be a child of god that quote says that brotherhood is not found in economy but through god and other men. 

You say I am the dumbest motherfucker on the internet yet you didnt even read and in the first isntance you maliciously edited King jrs words to fit your genocidal campaign of delusion.

State, MLK was very much anti-poverty as a christian but that does not make him a socialist/communist. He preached in the middle as he cared for all of gods children.",-0.9126,202

Buddhism:  560 BC,  From the Udanavarga 5:18-   ""Hurt not others with that which pains yourself.""

Judaism:  1300 BC,  from the Old Testament, Leviticus 19:18-  ""Thou shalt Love thy neighbor as thyself.""

Hinduism:  3200 BC, From the Hitopadesa-  ""One should always treat others as they themselves wish to be treated.""

Zoroastrianism:  600 BC, From the Shast-na-shayast 13:29-  ""Whatever is disagreeable to yourself, do not do unto others.""

Confucianism:  557 BC,  From the Analects  15:23-  ""What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.""

Socrates (470-399 B.C.):  ""Do not do to others what angers you if done to you by others.""

Christianity:  30 AD,  From the King James Version ,  7:12-  ""Whatsoever ye would that others should do to you,  do ye even so to them.""

Property rights and plaigarism is more important than anything, therefore everyone who said to treat others well after the first person who said it is a plaigarist and, therefore, I shall judge them forevermore!  Fuck the message!  I am awesome!  *FLEX*",0.704,242
