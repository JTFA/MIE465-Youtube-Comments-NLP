"BAD REPORTING!  The Daily Mail, September 15, 2012, reported Gerald Cavendish
Grosvenor (Viscount Belgrave) was about to spend around $500 million USD on
‚ÄúA stately home refurbishment,‚Äù for one of his mansions already worth over $1 billion.  Grosvenor The Duke of Westminster, owner of skyscrapers in 70 cities around the world including a half interest in the Wells Fargo Tower in Los Angeles, whose wife Natalia descends from Russian royalty representing $300 billion.  This house in Paris is NOT ""the world's most expensive house.""
Complete bullshit reporting.  This Paris guy is just a little tyke next to Grosvenor, whose family was in the Chinese opium ""trade"" by 1782 with a 350 ton ship bringing opium from India to China---and being paid in silver for the dangerous shit.  The Duke owns The Wheatsheaf Group, planning to feed the planet's small folks with treated sewage and soldier fly maggots.  This is only one instance of the terrific wealth represented in The Pilgrims Society, ""the world's most secret organization.""",-0.5893,196
