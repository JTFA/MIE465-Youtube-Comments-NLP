Americans are 20 or more trillion in debt?  Why?  Quite borrowing money from private banks.  Create your own money using JFK executive order 11110.  Replace illegal private debt based federal reserve notes with legal silver backed non debt based US government notes.  What happens when interest rates move back to 10 or more per cent?  Your whole income will be required to service debt?  Our monetary system is a Ponzi scheme.,-0.8725,79

"And after today's news, calling for MORE violence (the old and failed try to fight violence with more fear and violence method); and threats of yet more invasive human rights, family rights and privacy VIOLATIONS in this country; I'll ask again - where is there to go, in this increasingly stupid, spirit of Satan-influenced world system? Answer? No where. PRAY for Jehovah's Armageddon Day to sweep on through, to rid this earth of all vestiges of evil; to dissolve ALL of the corrupt and harmful ""kingdoms"" of man that now exist; and to bring in Jehovah the Universal Sovereign's own promised, heaven-based Kingdom, down to this earth, as its ONLY Rulership - so that all of the evil, violence, gross and harmful/destructive INJUSTICE, etc. that we see can FINALLY be brought to AN END!!!!!!! (Daniel 2:44) Truly godly people are NOT ""in their own way""; but a lot of grossly UNGODLY people ARE in our way - causing the stomachs of good and decent people to wretch in disgust on a frequent basis. ""THY KINGDOM COME. THY WILL BE DONE, ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN"". ""Heaven on earth/ We need it NOW.""",-0.9795,236

"Annoying? Not at all! I find him an extraordinary artist. However, doesn't need my endorsement - Sinatra, Leonard Cohen, BB King, in fact nearly every great artist of the past 40-50 years have done so. Major African artists have an album: Africa Sings U2.
Advocacy? I do not find a concern for human rights, opposition to torture, advocacy for young girls for schooling, for good drinking water, for affordable HIV treatment in Africa, for an end to hunger, extreme poverty - no, I find this immensely inspirational. Never annoying at all.

"Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Get out of your own way, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Bono]
Love hurts
Now you’re the girl who’s left with no words
Your heart’s a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn’t take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin’s not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies for assistance
The amorist, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I’d make it alright, alright
Nothing’s stopping you except what’s inside
I can help you, but it’s your fight, your fight

[Verse 2: Bono]
Fight back
Don’t take it lyin’ down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty’s starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got smacked in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin’ for someone to lead them
The master’s lookin’ for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln’s ghost said…

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I’d make it alright, alright
Nothing’s stopping you except what’s inside
I can help you, but it’s your fight, your fight

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away

Oh yeah, and 600.000 deaths in syria because of obama and clinton...where was bono's anger? Wars done by republicans are bad, wars done by democrats are good? U2-logic?
Don't get me wrong, i don't even like trump, and i'm from europe, but this american hollywood and music industrie is pure dumb propaganda. U2 support obama, so u2 support war. That's hard for me, because i liked them. Don't be blind",0.6572,165

"Wow. I just love this band. If people say that Bono´ s voice is not what it used to be. You have to remember how many years they have been active and how many recordings and concerts they have done throughout the years. I agree that their new music is good but not on the level as their records in the 80s and 90s. But really, it is hard to recreate the magic and the classic songs all over again. So i have respect that they just make the music that they want to do. I can honestly say that U2 have not done a ""bad"" album in my mind. I think that they consistently puts out good material and of cause they have their classic albums, but they really are a legendary band and will always be able to fill stadiums and be a great live band. :)",0.985,163
