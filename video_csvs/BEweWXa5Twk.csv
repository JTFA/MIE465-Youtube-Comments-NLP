But I appreciate you helping lady's who do,I learned a lot from my daughter but I never learned contouring. So thank you dear.",0.9516,64
"Girl...I gotta be honest. I enjoy your videos, but it's totally unnecessary to photoshop a thumbnail for a video claiming to be a no-surgery based tutorial.  As an art major, it doesn't take one of us to see that you edited your face. Just be real--everyone loves you for that, why bother trying to push it? I do also think you need to change up your makeup tutorials. I saw a series of 5-7 thumbnails in a row that were all different looks--supposedly--and they literally all look the same. Maybe get more creative with your glam looks, because at this point you look like every other make youtuber and all your glam looks are nearly identical.",0.9292,129
