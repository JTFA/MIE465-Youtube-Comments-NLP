Before You wrote what You just commented, did You Research that?! No....Let me help You.

4 times in Stephen Curry Career, seasons, he has shoot under 44% from the Three Point Line. 2 times he shot at 44%, and 3 times at 45+%

Rookie season he shot: 43%",0.1511,67
"C. Kizzee 
Doesn't mean I don't like him because I am speaking Truth. People say what they say out of Respect.

I leading you and guiding You to Facts and Truth. So that means I don't like someone now in this day in age that is considered being bias or not liking someone?!

Mostly every player in the NBA makes shots consistently....lol....You have Your take I have mine, nothing wrong with that.

So let's forget about his first 4 years when Stephen Curry was a horrible shooter. I mean yeah that don't matter. And having back to back games going 0-12, and even going 2-27 at times. This is all from behind the Three Point Line. He could of easily step up a few inches or drove to the basket to not shoot so poorly. But no, Curry had to shoot the Three Pointer at all cost. 

Now that is what I am talking about when it comes to ""skill set, percentages, and intangibles,"" nothing to do with not liking, being bias to a man I never met!!",0.7853,206
"C. Kizzee 
I am done, you all can love the mess out of Stephen Curry basketball game. Even have an orgy with him for what it is worth....lol....Be easy man!😀🏀",0.7088,40
"C. Kizzee 
Sorry man you barking up the wrong tree. You need to compare or do comparison then. Go to: www.basketball-reference.com

That is where I get my information from Sir....This shows you game from game. From the athlete\player first season to the athlete player most recent season. 

Never brought up handles, I and even You ""brought up skill sets and intangibles."" We are on the lines of what does Curry had to offer besides his range? Or what else does Curry and or Kyrie does even when they're not scoring?

Not Biases about ""Percentages"" because of the High volume of three point shoots taken in this era then before. I do, do my research that shows you are not comparing statistics then if Your thinking Stephen Curry ""percentages"" are better. Larry Bird, and Reggie Miller toke less shots then Stephen Curry. But they all made shots at the same volume taken. So I am not sure where there is a Bias?

Also Stephen Curry averages a lot more three point take as You as stated and what the references of basketball is showing. But he has the lowest made percentages based on how many shots taken to, how shots being made. One season he toke 600 plus three pointers, want to know how many he made? Less than 250. Not sure how that is good. 

Oh yes I an happy you just brought this up about Stephen Curry in ""Clutch,"" and ""Big Moments,"" have less than 20% rating. Stephen Curry have not capitalized on many. Kyrie Irving has a few too, not many neither. But we know him for that one so far because every one hates Lebron especially Skip Bayless....lol....Brings up Chris Bosh rebound to Ray Allen shot, and Kyrie Irving three pointer that was made on Stephen Curry. 

If you are a Lebron James or Micheal Jordan fan here is one for you: Michael Jordan has a 51% rating for Big Moments. Know how Lebron James rate? 47%. People don't know that because we discount a lot of things one do that the other do, that is Biased. Bit since we are ""Comparing,"" that is not Biased. Curry is no Greater than Bird, Allen, and or Miller. Even Kyrie, same boat but some ""intangibles and skill qualities,"" set them all apart.",-0.3369,454

Though Kyrie was remarkably efficient the entire game, more so than Curry. However Curry's off ball movement and ability to get great separation are what got him more open looks and offensive opportunities and eventually 49 points, besting even Kyrie in this situation against the #1 defensive team in the entire NBA. In that Curry scored nearly HALF of his team's points, HALF of them.  

#1 Defensive team vs #1 Offensive team - It was a level paying field, they both have a great bench, they both have important team injuries, in addition to starters & great team coordination.

"Does Anyone care about all star selection out nowadays? All stars are voted in based on popularity not performance. What's next we gonna justify performance with participation ribbons next? Not to mention GSW has important injuries as well, for example Patrick Mccaw is out injured who's relatively efficient despite low minutes & Jordan bell has been on Fire lately especially on defence, grabbing boards despite being a low round second pick and was recently injured as well, and actually being a threat on offence unlike Smart who has a terrible shooting %.. Basketball is a 5 on 5 game, you can only put 5 at a time, Boston already had all the personnel they needed to beat the warriors just like last time. Smart or no Smart.

Smart can play defence alright, but he's been shooting bricks all season long, he's not a two way player by any means, wouldn't have impacted the game since no one could lock down Curry this time on defence anyways even though he was double teamed all night, Jaylen Brown and Al horford couldn't do Jack to stop Curry so please, even Kawhi has trouble defending Curry let alone Smart who's in his rookie year smh. Hayward would've made a difference, might have won them the game but I can't rule out Jordan bell who's been more efficient offensively & his great defensive & post ability to control the boards he's shown thus far even though he's in his rookie season & Mccaw who's just as efficient and far more of a threat on offence than Smart and is in his second year now. 

Smart is a factor on defence, though is liability on the offensive end

Jordan Bell has a 66 FG% so I would pick him on offence over Hayward's career 44%, being that Hayward is also still a below average 3pt shooter 35% - They're pretty equally valuable on defence as far as I've seen. (Note that I can't compare Hayward's 2017-2018 season since it's a low sample size due to his being injured against the Cavs just as the season began)

Jordan Bell > Smart - Easily laughable comparison 

Mccaw for offence - Smart for Defence

Celtics won last time because they got to the line a RIDICULOUS amount of time compared to GSW and it was STILL a close game, as it also slows down the pace since you have to play against a SET DEFENCE every time someone goes to the line as opposed to transition, factoring in the fact that GSW is one of the best transition offensive team, being 2nd in pace in the entire NBA.",0.9906,471

"Few things wrong so i'll point them out. Steph wasn't blessed with a beast team from the start, of the players we consider all stars on that team he was the first drafted and the team was then built around him. First few years fighting through injuries and bad teams he came out and became a 2x time MVP and NBA champion. 

Kyrie like Steph didn't have a good team to start either, but then was blessed as you would say to play with lebron and Kevin love. 

Curry makes the warriors the team they are, without KD they went 73-9, he would be amazing on most other teams.

Also Kyrie doesn't usually guard Curry, they play either Smart or Rozier on Curry majority of the time, just as Klay plays Kyrie.

Nice try though.",0.9643,148

Far better as in, team that is it....lol....Stop creating narrative for Stephen Curry. We act like some can't disagree or it is a problem. Like that person has to Bias or have a hate for that person. Statistically Stephen Curry has the same stats. But there skill sets, intangibles, and basketball skills he lacks. That is why he had to develop a three point range.

We forget about actually All Around players\athlete. Chris Paul, John Wall are more ideal Point Guards because they display all around offense and defense consistently compared to Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry. Since they just getting they're team that is okay to be around them, they're not noticed as much or considered to be better overall point guards.

4 and 5 assist last night, that is acceptable in this era because they had 37 and 49 points. Elite in points but not at team basketball. No way should these two players\athlete not average 10 assist a game with the teams they're playing on. 

But I am being Bias and hating, help me figure out how is that not possible. I don't mean a few games out of the season I mean consistently. There Point Guards right?! But since we like to gloss over ""Real Statistics,"" I will be wrong in people eyes!",0.3659,255

"Good defensive rating but poor offensive rating, Smart is an entirely non factor on offence, a liability actually  - Basketball is about point differential, that's how you win games

Don't make me laugh, are the Celtics so bad of a team that removing 1 player, who's a rookie role player in his third year that would be entirely responsible for the Celtics #1 defence? would make it worse than the Warriors if he's not on the court LMFAO? You've clearly never played actual team basketball, Defence is not a 1 man game, basketball isn't a 1 man game, it requires team coordination & communication on switches for example, why do you think the Cavs suck on defence even despite adding Jay Crowder who was previously Bostons ACE defender? One man, Smart, who's not even the team best defender (Ie Jaylen Brown) won't make a significant difference since basketball is played 5 on 5, not to mention he's a liability on offence. 

GSW has important injuries as well, Even Playing field Deal with it - Jordan Bell & Mccaw

For example Patrick Mccaw is out injured who's relatively efficient despite low minutes & Jordan bell has been on Fire lately especially on defence, grabbing boards despite being a low round second pick and was recently injured as well, and actually being a threat on offence unlike Smart who has a terrible shooting %

Jordan Bell has a 66 FG% so I would pick him on offence over Hayward's career 44%, being that Hayward is also still a below average 3pt shooter 35% - They're pretty equally valuable on defence as far as I've seen. (Note that I can't compare Hayward's 2017-2018 season since it's a low sample size due to his being injured against the Cavs just as the season began)

Jordan Bell > Smart - Easily laughable comparison 

Mccaw for offence - Smart for Defence

Smart can play defence alright, but he's been shooting bricks all season long, he's not a two way player by any means, wouldn't have impacted the game since no one could lock down Curry this time on defence anyways even though he was double teamed all night, Jaylen Brown and Al horford couldn't do Jack to stop Curry so please, even Kawhi has trouble defending Curry let alone Smart who's in his rookie year smh. Hayward would've made a difference, might have won them the game but I can't rule out Jordan bell who's been more efficient offensively & his great defensive & post ability to control the boards he's shown thus far even though he's in his rookie season & Mccaw who's just as efficient and far more of a threat on offence than Smart and is in his second year now.",0.9777,495

Steph got the W, but Kyrie was more impressive. You can't fault Kyrie for not scoring more because it was not possible lol. KERR gamelan was to limit Kyrie to under 20 attempts hence he was doubled before even getting the ball. Kyrie scored on more impressive defenders.

No beef or problem with Stephen Curry shooting three pointers. This was not a ""Duel"" is was ""Dual."" 

Curry and Kyrie did not go back and forth with each other. So that makes it a Dual. They didn't guard each other more than 30% of the game. That is what we are missing for a Duel. 

Go and leave that conversation, Stephen Curry can shoot but is not the Best Three Point Shooter in history. He can become the Best in History before he retires if if Three Point ""Shooting Percentage,"" goes up.

As of now Stephen Curry isn't even the Top Three Point Shooter in the league....lol",-0.9541,186

I used no excuses lovely, I use straight Facts and Truths. You have not done Your Research. You just started watching Basketball, I been watching Basketball when Michael Jordan started playing. I was born in 1982 by 1986 I was dribbling a basketball. 

I used pure Facts and Truth,  not one thing I said was because ""I Hate Someone. i Never Met."" Stephen Curry game haven't changed since he entered the NBA. But so how after his 5 season he is the Best Shooter\Three Pointer Shooter of All Time all of sudden. Records are good, but it won't show how poorly he shot in other games before or after that. Hey misses, your take, I just don't ignore statistics like that. Be blessed!",0.8932,146
"Nila Kuna 
Your calling what I say based on what I see and what You don't Acknowledge. I bet You can not tell me one weak point in his game aka skill set?! Stephen Curry mentioned it many times

He breaking records because no thought to shoot All there shoots from the Three Point line.

So You say I use Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, and Larry Bird. Okay let's use Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Kyle Korver. Now You go dismiss them like other people but the funny part that is they actually shoot better then Stephen Curry. That is not Hate neither, or a Bias.

Kyle Korver have a made a three pointer in every game for the past 5 years, except one time. Did You know that?! 

I will hit You with Facts & Truth till You do Your Research. Not using hear say from other people, announcers, ESPN, and or SportsCenter. Do You actually watch these Basketball games?! Did You watch Stephen Curry in the Finals?! Playoffs?!

This season: Klay Thompson is the Leader in Three Point Percentage right now....",0.9333,213

Right now he’s on pace to break the record for most consecutive games with 5 or more 3s made. I don’t know what type of hate or bias you have against Steph but the writing is on the wall.

Korver, Durant, and Thompson dont compare to Curry. Thompson is also one of the best 3pt shooters in history right now but Curry is better. Yeah Curry isn’t athletically gifted, that’s Westbrook, and he’s not the greatest passer, thats Nash, Stockton, or CP3, but he’s the greatest shooter we’ve ever seen. You can talk about Korver, Durant, Allen, Miller, whoever you want to mention, none of them have set the all-time 3s in a season or a game, and none of them were the youngest to make 1,000 3s. And Curry is also a great finisher at the rim, so he’s not just a 3pt shooter period. Curry’s range is unmatched, he can hit shots from literally anywhere on the court. He’s modernized the 3pt game.

I'm not even a warriors fan, I'm just saying to take the L. And steph is more impressive than curry, but kyrie is still young and he has a lot more years.",0.818,110

suiken Curry has scored more on better defenders in the past. So I’m pretty sure he would’ve still went off for the same amount. Great they won 2 and Smart happened to be in it but that’s a very small sample size to make you’re conclusion from. I’m pretty sure they won 2 of 3 in the past 3 years.,0.9757,74
suiken They are still the best defense in the league without him. These niggas don’t have Gordon Hayward. I’m sure they are fine without Smart. Don’t try and discredit.,0.8214,39
