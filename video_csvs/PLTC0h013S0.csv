Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know they're trying to make a statement after Matt's firing that says, ""See, we do respect women,..we're filling BOTH slots with women,"" but, it's pretty transparent.  Plus, NBC probably has a guilty conscious since they knew Matt was doing things behind the scenes, and didn't want to do anything about it, because they didn't want to interrupt his tenure with the station, or have his kind of flaw on their product.  Kathy Lee and Hoda have a huge following, especially with women who see their show and identify with it like they do with their own ""best gal pal"" scenario.  Another women won't have the same chemistry with Kathy Lee that Hoda does after 11 years, and a man will have a completely different and jarring affect to the show.  Can you imagine a straight man REALLY getting into the ambush makeovers segment?  I don't think so,..breaking up these two is as big of a mistake as bringing on Megyn Kelly on to host her new show.",0.9764,227
