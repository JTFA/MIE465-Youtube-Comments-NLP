Birds of a feather flock together. Trump came with tons of baggage but it didnâ€™t stop Americans from voting for him.

These individuals, not surprisingly, engage in conscious and sub-conscious tactics to bring-in more homofascists, much like a cancer, until a tipping-point is reached where the organization's ""immune system"" has been fully-compromised. They began censoring dissenting opinions on their own public forum, for example. That's the state of the NY Times now, and there is zero hope for recovery. Even if they were to rid themselves of all the homofascists/Marxists/etc., their reputation would remain irreparably broken.",-0.7691,146

are the same thing. The only difference is that Trump was elected instead of
Clinton. Remember when people were going to throw out the Republcans in favor
of Obamacare? They should have considereing the votes for Trumprelief (the G.O.P.'s
tax plan). Trump is the third term of Obama, and Obama was heading this country
for a Great Depression. Go figure. Didn't we have a Great Recession under
Obama? Do you remember the housing market crash of 2008. Well those people are

"Public opinion has weight, but not this time. According to the 6th amendment it is innocent until proven guilty, but I guess you just throw that one out of the window.

The numbers are staggering, overwhelmingly, by non other than democrats, who are losing the majority of their seats in congress, and are trying to gain them back. Watch once he wins today in Alabama, these women will disappear, never to be heard from again, just like Trumps accusers. Trump has a new accuser ""LOL come forward"", since the Russian collusion story was proven to be false. The Democrats are trying way to hard, no one likes them anymore.",0.8641,170
