"A faster way to make the hangers. Use a 90 degree V cutter to make pairs of parallel grooves across the plastic sheet. Laser cut the hanger parts across the lines. Build a folding jig to set the parts on, blow on the parts with a heat gun then push down into the jig with a tool shaped to fit into the keyhole slot. Squirt a little solvent along the inside of the folded corners. Faster to produce and stronger since they're one piece. Making 400 would be worth the bother to design and build the tools to fold them.",0.0258,108
"As you were using solvent to bond the pieces together, is that acrylic? I have some polycarbonate I need to bond, I wonder if you have any experience with that material?",0.0,35

"Why went holes only on the edge, not on all part surface?Wouldn't it be more precise this way?Also, I bet  this machined alu cost like few hundreds euro, for hundreds parts can you get away with hard wood or POM?",0.3899,48
makes sense!  thx,0.4199,4
"the how plastic adapts to the surface slowly and the edge is the last corner where the plastic goes and fits. That is why is where the air would get compressed. Is the last spot where the air does have to go out, so the perfect place for the holes too.",0.6096,55
