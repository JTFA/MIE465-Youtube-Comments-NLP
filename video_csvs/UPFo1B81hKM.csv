"1. *Arkangel*  underrated af, romance subplot was meh and ending was ok but still loved it
2. *USS Callister*  Funny as hell, totally took me by surprise cuz I assumed this would be the worst
3. *Hang the DJ*  great idea, a bit too similar to San Junipero for my like, ending was sweet but a bit cheesy
4. *Black Museum*  Similar to White Christmas (my favourite ep) with different storylines but some were odd and ending didn't work imo
5. *Crocodile*  her motivations make no sense, and the ending was dumb af
6. *Metalhead*  The only ep I say you could skip, I'm still not sure what the message or idea of it was

Ultimately, this is probably my least favourite season, I feel like since it moved to Netflix the stories are too ""Americanised"" and are becoming repetitive.",0.551,171

"Arda Baris Alcicek Agree to disagree I guess. While Crocodile was very messy at times, I thought that the episode was going for a more general criticque of interaction with technology as a whole which for me still sort of worked. From the opening where their inattention to their driving led to them running over a bystander to how tech failed to save them when they needed it most( the car refusing to start). Never found it boring and complete nonesense. 

With Metalhead though there just wasn't anything there to root for. It felt like they were parodying a low-budget B-movie for tv but with a big budget and little means to create sympathy. There was tension all right, but that was all there was. There's stories that leave you to fill in the gaps, and then there's stories that just leave too much of the basic setup unexplained or unfulfilled and come off trying to be clever. 

Oh well. At least we'll still have those upcoming prose anthology stories this year.",0.015,187

"Arkangel was more of a lesson for all the parents out there who tries to live through their kids life.I see so many parents like the mom in this episode,they make them weak and they are so overly protective instead of just letting them experience fear and pain on their own.I almost got kidnapped when I was a kid,I got bullied hardcore in high school and I experienced a lot of bad things in my childhood that my parents still to this day never knew about but I feel like this made me the strong adult I am today.",0.2447,108
"As a whole, this season was a little weaker than the previous 3, but then I personally think Hang the DJ joins the best of the series. So in general, a bit weaker, but saved by some excellent individual episodes. I think the problem the show is beginning to face is that there are only so many places they can go with this theme and it will eventually become repetitive or begin to seem unoriginal. And the viewers very much know the formula and patterns a Black Mirror episode works with so we can more easily predict the twists and turns, and we get used to the darkness to the point where the episodes are much less impactful than when the show was truly a novelty. To prolong the freshness of the show, they're going to have to take risks that aren't always going to appeal to the audience unanimously. Despite this, the show is always incredibly well crafted and remains an entertaining, yet thought-provoking piece of television, so I'll continue to watch and anticipate new seasons. I just hope it never gets to the point where the creators know they are out of fresh content and willingly give us subpar material to continue making money.",0.9728,222

Everything either felt wrongly easy to anticipate or the twist was corny/low effort/not entertaining. It was nice to see the whole season had female protagonists of all different personalities, I always feel like even though there are a lot of female protagonists in current media, it's rare that they're actually interesting or unique or badass like a lot of them were in this season. I probably would have enjoyed the series if I hadn't spent days binging different tv shows as I lay in bed with flu. I think I was getting so fed up with the same stories and twists it became really easy to anticipate them and black mirror season 4 was no exception. The only one I actually enjoyed was black museum and I watched it when I felt much better because after the first 5 I kind of lost interest in watching the 6th. I ended up watching it just because I wanted to finish the series so my thoughts on the series were full but I ended up really enjoying it.",0.9481,213

"It does not take place in a single shared universe - although the episodes themselves bring lots of tie-ins to other episodes and pieces of a supposedly established lore. This is why I think these Easter Eggs and elements are just Charlie Brooker mocking the fans and bringing elements that trespass the fourth wall (e.g. the newspaper article seen in S04E03 'Crocodile': https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7mv2yn/s04e03_easter_egg_of_course_the_real_question_is/, the dianosis messages on the van monitor in S04E05, 'Metalhead':  https://i.redd.it/0j409y0g3l701.jpg) 

Although there are a few serious connections from one episode to another, as if there were really a Lore, like the one in S03E06 'Hated in the Nation', where Blue Colson says explicitly she had worked on the Rannoch Case seen in S02E02 'White Bear', but as long as I can remember this is the closest to a 'serious' tie-in the show brings",-0.2525,161

I liked black museum though, I was in a pretty spaced out mood and didn't put the pieces together until the ending but it did give me a much better experience. Maybe I should have watched this season when I was too tired to predict the story arch? Idk I watched all the other seasons when I was pretty awake and thought they were so good and harrowing. Crocodile and Black Museum were the only ones I felt really harrowed by. USS Callister felt predictable as hell, hang the dj ending felt cop out-y I was really hoping for like a tragic romance in this trapped technology driven world with some odd twists but then it turns out to just be a shitty visualisation of a dating app like cmon even if the tragic romance story is more predictable it would've tapped into the feels more. The moment they were like ""ever noticed how you always end up skimming stones the same bounces"" I was like ""aw please don't make this some sort of simulation bullshit or if it is at least put a twist on it"" and the twist was just disappointing. Crocodile felt predictable as hell after she killed the guy but at least it had a really dark ending.
