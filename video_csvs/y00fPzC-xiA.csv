"+Plasma Channel 
me too.
I had built a the same but with a neodymium magnet.
its cool to learn extra things than what's taught to us at school",0.4497,31
+Plasma Channel cool,0.3182,4
"Also, they can be a little finicky. Make sure the enamel is totally removed from the halves, and the battery leads are fully stripped.",0.2585,28
"Appreciate the build.
Super simple.",0.765,7
"Are you sure that you used only wire? (in title: ..with using only wire..) Because i think that you used battery too. 
peace",0.7003,30
Awesome,0.6249,1
Awesome video i Like it üëå‚ô•Ô∏èüëç :),0.8625,10
Big respect again,0.4767,3
Can you make a video discussing the possibility of plasma lightsabers?,0.0,12
"Can you see this principle /watch?v=gduYoT9sMaE   being used in a Tesla/bladeless turbine, using neodymium discs preferably  /watch?v=ZfR-ur1lJ5Q   High enough tension would eliminate the need for contacts, though high current would probably melt everything. Some math has to be done.
btw some wood carving /watch?v=_mg4THnpbus&t=1m30s",-0.4291,71
"Certainly can, but it reduces the lifespan of the spindle",0.1779,11
Congracts... you just made the world's simplest DC series motor. It should also work on AC,0.0,18
Dang it. You indeed have a point.,0.0,9
Dude yes!!!!! Awesome episode!,0.7405,8
"Excellent, great you enjoy!",0.906,6
Good bro,0.4404,2
Great idea. I can do a video on this,0.6249,10
"Great idea. I could potentially do that, yes! The physics behind that may be theoretical... so I‚Äôll need to really make that episode interesting somehow (otherwise it will all be just talking!)",0.8774,41
Haha. The episode we‚Äôll post tomorrow is going to be a legit mustache,0.4588,16

Seems a clean and simple build!",0.4574,8

I like that you like it. ; P,0.6124,9
"I never knew that you can make a motor with just simply wire, now that's pretty cool!",0.6996,19
"I think it'll work at any frequency... you see, the field coil is in series with the armature coil... so, at any given instant, the same current is flowing through both the coils, and there is no phase difference between the current in the 2 coils... so, if the direction of current in 1 coil reverses, the current direction in the other coil will also reverse at the exact same time instant, and the direction of torque will remain unchanged",-0.296,90
"I understand entirely! When I was in 3rd grade my parents bought me a similar kit from my elementary school's monthly festival. It was one of two things I can tie my love of science back to. Two things in 3rd grade, then a specific tesla coil in 11th grade!",0.8395,55
Imagine powering something like this with a wireless charger,0.3612,9
In the video you said wire 26ga but you use 32ga wire. I build it and nothing happens..,0.0,20
"Jan, my apologies. When I get youtube comments on my phone, the app does not tell me which video it is for. I get dozens of people asking me about wire gauge....and they are always for the DIY tesla coil video. I thought your question was also for the tesla coil video. You are correct, this motor uses 26 gauge (wire needs to be stiff enough to also act as a support). Terribly sorry for the confusion. You can, however, now use that 32 gauge as winding for a tesla coil!",-0.75,107
"Magnet wire is just wire with thin insulation on it, meant for winding electromagnets üëç",0.0,16
Magnetic gauge wire?  Is that a solid copperwire or something different?  Where can I get it?  You win the science fair!,0.8192,25
"Make sure when scraping off enamel from a half of wire, you remove all of it from that half of the circumference. If you only scrape a line of enamel off, motor will not function!",0.3802,39
My thanks! It should work with ac assuming the rotation matches up to the frequency of ac properly,0.4926,19

I like it.",0.3612,10

Thank you. I love these little motors.,0.7717,9

Thanks! It‚Äôs a fun little diy project isn‚Äôt it?,0.7574,15
Thanks. I love ferrofluid. Have made a bit of it myself. Fascinating stuff1,0.891,17
That would be a great experiment...to see if reverse polarity winding the coils could function with ac,0.6249,19
They are pretty cool!,0.6996,5
Truly is! Give it a try,0.4926,7
Use a bigger battery,0.0,4
Very cool!.  Ever messed with ferrofluid? Seems right up your alley.,-0.4508,15
"Very nice, and I enjoy the humour, but I'm extremely disturbed by that unsymmetrical moustache, LOL.",0.7421,20
Very very nice :),0.7854,4
When I was like 7 my dad got me a kit to make a motor with a permanent magnet and I tried replacing it with a coil but couldnt make it work back then I wish I still had that kit (I'm almost 16 now),0.6486,47
With support like this I most certainly will,0.7841,8
Yeah? Haha,0.6369,3
"You did a twirly Lemmy moustache?   I can't even watch the video now I'm laughing so much.    
ok I watched it.   good fun.",0.8974,27
"adding 2 LEDs in the coil  with 2 diode oppositely connected diode.
it would make a blinking half cycle light.
I tried it today and used two LEDs one red another blue.
was  amazing.
like the police.
used a 9v power supply.",0.743,48
helut kuno yap thats true,0.4215,5
hm. I shall test this. Thanks! I'll get back to you.,0.5672,15
honored you enjoyed,0.7964,3
it might work because you dont have a fix pole into this motor like a permanent magnet ones have so every time that the magnetic direction change it will change in both coils,0.3612,33
the simpliest universal motor on eart,0.0,6
very good videos. damn. hell yeah,-0.4889,8
