"I love this movie so much! It's become one of my all time favorites and I really do hope it's continued. What separates this fantasy film from others for me is how realistic the characters are, it's not just CGI but actual make-up and prosthetics. The other thing is the fantasy beings themselves, it's not just the traditional Elf & Dwarf that are classic to most fantasy based things but Other beings that aren't well explored are being given the spotlight. To highlight the Orc race is something that stands out, I don't feel they get much of a back story as the classic beings and they are constantly given ugly features and ugly reputations. Bright shows their lighter side and gives us something likable about them. I'm also not big on Fantasy in a modern setting, but Bright has done a really great job on hooking and pulling me in despite that. They make the characters and plot blend so well into a modern world that I wish it was true reality.",0.9564,185

"Im gonna be honest, this movie had the potential to expand beyond just orcs elves and fairies. Like orcs and elves arent anything compared to other mythical creatures listed. you know, not make every orc look almost exactly the same as well.

"Shadowrun haha good sense of humour and awareness at least :D I enjoyed the movie the same way. Was great watch at times, but it wasn't very well made: heavy handed directing and wasteful production values. I kept getting distracted by it trying too hard. Often it felt contrived because illogical storyboarding and irrational sequences of character behaviour, or pushing the lore too hard (recent Blade Runner a perfect example of minimalism here). I still liked Bright a lot. It was pretty cool at times, had a few glimmers of Training Day mystique, and at the very least was unique and curious. Very fun setting, likable acting, overall enjoyed it a lot haha just I thought was more poorly directed than even Street Kings when it could easily be up there with End of Watch.",0.9928,151
