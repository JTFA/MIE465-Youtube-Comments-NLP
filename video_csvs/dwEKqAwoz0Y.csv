"And about AR Bernard... I am extremely disappointed. I had loved his teachings in the past, and was very saddened when his teachings went off the air maybe 8-10 years ago. But then I became excited to see his show come back maybe a year or more ago. But for some reason, and God knowing how I felt about my desire to record his shows, my attempts to record them became continuously interrupted and stopped, over and over again. I became very frustrated, but even then, wondering if there was some reason God didn‚Äôt want me to watch. Now maybe I understand that God could have had something to do with stopping these recordings purposefully and revealing to me that there is something wrong, and that maybe I should not put so much weight in him any longer. God does communicate when He wants to, but one must be open, receptive, and listening. I don‚Äôt have this same problem, consistently, with any other teachers that I regularly record and follow. Unfortunately, it sounds to me like he is perhaps compromising himself out to the world now‚Ä¶ and this is really too bad‚Ä¶",-0.4034,220

It seems to be almost solely orchestrated by NRA lobbyists, but Republican lawmakers happily take the money and then represent the issue in terms of personal liberty rather than safety. Part of this strategy is peddling this narrative about praying for the victims being such an important and respectful thing to do.

The cynical nature of this (and in fact the hateful rhetoric of the evangelical right in America in general) has crushed most of my respect for religious leaders slowly but surely, and I'm sure the same is the case for many people on the left. I think this is the reason why Sam would mock religion. The right have repeatedly shown their respect for personal liberty and religion to be entirely opportunistic, based on keeping up the flow of lobbying money rather than actually working to try and solve Americas enormous problem with gun violence. That, to me, makes it ripe for satire, a type of entertainment that sometimes includes mockery.

The problem is she openly mocks religion and then makes a video on how religious people should act politically. She has no moral compass when it comes to this topic and has no grounds to preach to anyone on",-0.8176,108

"ferox965 not saying you need religion, I responded to yodra with a pretty obvious reason why you would respect it. The argument of if you need religion to determine what‚Äôs right or wrong is a way more in depth discussion, is right and wrong cultural, how do you define right and wrong, what makes your definition right and the others wrong... that conversation is endless.

But  why should Evangelicals who are openly mocked by Samantha and the political party she is a part of listen to her and disown the political party that gives their opinion a platform to speak and consideration. This video is an obvious attempt to have Evangelicals act against their own interests politically and act in favor of Samantha‚Äôs left wing belief, the same group that mocks Religion.",-0.1779,147
"ferox965: she is allowed to say what she wants, never said she couldn‚Äôt. As I‚Äôm allowed to point out how she openly mocks religion and then pretends like she is on the side of religious people to tell religious people what to do.
The second part if you are asking what‚Äôs the difference with Fox and Breitbart vs Sam, Fox and Breitbart are not shoved down your throat like left wing views are on all other news channels, all late night shows, the majority of comedians, on YouTube, in your movies, music and TV shows.
If you are asking what is the difference in the views..The key difference is the right generally wants less government, less taking of your money in the form of taxes and they believe individuals should be responsible for themselves vs the left who wants bigger government, more of your money in the form of tax and believes in collectivism which has been shown to fail across the globe.",0.1531,186
