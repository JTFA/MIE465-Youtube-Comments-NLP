"Hi mate, noticed you‚Äôve put the blade Bevel up into the plane, looks like you‚Äôve got a high bed angle already, it should work fine Bevel down, easier to push, Bevel up and a high bed angle means scraping plane territory, and it‚Äôs a bummer to push. Try using it Bevel down like a normal plane, and turn the blade around for scraping some really nasty grain if you can‚Äôt get a smooth surface normally. Saves a lot of arm fatigue.
