"As much as I hate this incredibly watered down echo of Mat Pat's theory that has literally no reason to exist other then for Cracked to try and ride the Stranger Things hype train without a ticket, I think we're all focusing on the wrong thing here - (Season 2 spoilers incoming)






This theory was more or less disprove: The upside down monsters have been shown to reproduce and exist en mass completely separate from Eleven. Granted the Season 1 monster's parallels seem to be more then coincidence, At this point it's more likely the Season 1 monster was some sort of scout working for the mind flayer rather then a manifestation of Eleven.

Mat Pat made his video before Season 2 was aired and even acknowledged he might be wrong, Cracked has no excuse.",-0.9001,144

Or how about how Kali and Eleven were meant to have all of the powers of the other as well as their own in order to make a psychic super soldier.

"everybody is saying that this theory falls apart because of season two, but (as usual) I disagree. I'll TL;DR(at the bottom. [I promise it's not a rocket ship... cause that's right here: (_)_)::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::D~~~~~])
the theory states that the upside down is a figment of Jane's imagination, a really beefy figment.
until she escapes the lab Jane has basically nothing good in her life, then they put her in a sensory deprivation tank with one of the most power brains on earth and no good things to think about. It sounds weird in there, through the glass and water the machinery and computers in the lab probably sound pretty monstrous, to hit the nail with too fine a point firmly on the head. so her brain concocts the demogorgon, because human brains love making nightmare fuel. at first it's just an image, a hallucination that haunts her dark place. Then Anderson Cooper tells her to go poke it. when this happens in the show we see Jane in a considerable amount of discomfort and the gate opening up in front of her. according to this theory that event is her acknowledging her fear on a physical level. this sets off a wildcat destabilization of the engine core, and her brain creates another dimension for her fears to live in. so the upside down is the nightmare of a brain so powerful it can create other dimensions (or at least fill an existing empty one). the gate is the idea that her fear of the lab (and Anderson Cooper) can still reach out an fuck up her life on the outside. and, just like 8 says, it's going to keep growing and festering (underneath Hawkins) until she gives it the ole Clint Eastwood stare. but just like with the rest of us, facing your fears doesn't make them go away, it's just the first step.
""I felt frozen,"" ""frozen like cold?"" ""no, like how you feel when you're scared and you can move, or think, or do anything.""
""What is this thing?"" ""I don't know. It's more like a feeling"" 
They don't call him ""Will the Wise"" for no reason, he's dead on. The demogorgons are like boogeymen, but the shadow is what made Jane make them. It is paralyzing fear, deep and cold to the core of your being. it has no meaning beyond that, it does not desire, it simply is fear incarnate. the shadow cant get to Jane because she's in denial, so it goes for the only other person who's close enough to the upside down, Will (until they chase it out with the lamest exorcism ever [not that I'd complain if I were in the receiving end]). but this is, after all, Jane's fear and is bound to her as heat to fire. That's why the last scene of 2 reminds us that the shadow is still fallowing Jane, still trying to reach out and drag her back to *that* time in *that* place.

TL;DR: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand stranger things. The story is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the plot points will go over a typical viewer’s head. That said, the intent IS to provide viewers with a sense of pride and satisfaction for completing new episodes.
