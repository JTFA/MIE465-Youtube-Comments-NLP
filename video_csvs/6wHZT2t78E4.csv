"(((We are all in a Spiritual battle for our SOULS!!!)))

***There is an ongoing Spiritual battle for all of our SOULS! And all of us are being used as guinea pigs for SATAN and you don‚Äôt even know it! 

*** But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and (((SORCERERS))), and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Revelation 21:8). 

(Sorcery=Pharmakeia in the Greek Language=Pharmacy=DRUG USERS! 

This is a freewill open door portal, to allow them to come into your body/temple of every foul and unclean Spirit/Demon. Your freewill choice‚Äôs gives them the access so they can take it over). 

*** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul. (Proverbs 8:36). (So when you are sinning against God you are sinning against your own Soul. 

*** abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. (1 Peter 2:11). (Lust is a name of a Demonic Spirit. Just like the Spirit of Anger, Homosexuality and Pride etc. 

***Now with this CERN/The Devils Portal being opened up in the name of, ‚ÄúScience‚Äù, this world is becoming HELL which, the Baphomet/Satan wants as his saying goes, ‚ÄúAs above, so Below.‚Äù This is why you need to put the Blood of Jesus all over yourselves and your family members. And by showing Jesus you love him by obeying his commandments‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

***(Jesus): You will know the truth and the truth will set you free. (John 8:32). (Set you free from what??? Demonic Spirits!!! Submit to God and Resist the devil and he will flee from you!!! (James 4:7). 

*** And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. (Luke 10:17).

***Keep in mind, God will not allow Demonic Spirits to destroy mankind. Demonic Spirits, through mans freewill, is the only way they can cause harm to us and make us hurt or destroy our selves. Jesus, my king and hopefully your king as well, has them on a short leash or they would destroy the earth if they got the chance. 

***Remember, Demonic Spirits are inter-dimensional beings with alien bodies. Case in point, ‚ÄúThe Greys‚Äù, are the working bees of SATAN!!!

*** For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (Ephesians 6:12).",-0.9695,568

"Going to see WWE at Barclay's center was a huge mistake.  This wasn't the worst 200 dollars I've ever spent, 160 for the tickets and 40 for the train, but it was certainly THE MOST DISAPPOINTING 200 dollars I've ever spent.  I went to see the WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment, which means that 1/3 of the show is about the world, 1/3 of the show SHOULD BE WRESTLING - AT LEAST - and a 1/3 of the show can be promos, interviews, and backstage happenings. 1/3 of this show wasn't wrestling.  After 2 hours there were 2 matches.  The woman's match was entirely boring, as just Sasha Banks was getting beaten on the entire time.  The second match was good.  From the beginning of the show, we had to wait over 2 hours for the third match which was a bizarre booking decision as Slater and Rhino faced Titus and Apollo.  And this was the last match of the night.  3 hours and 3 matches, and these weren't long matches.  There's absolutely no way a wrestling show can be entertaining if in three hours there's only 45 minutes of less than stellar matches.  Secondly, I went to and paid to see a wrestling show AT THE BARCLAY'S CENTER.  Why am I seeing nothing happening at THE BARCLAY'S CENTER, and why I am forced to watch the television screens there to see what's happening at the Manhattan Center?  That was the worst part of the night.  I could have just stayed at home and watched TV, why did I have to pay 200 dollars to see WWE Live if when I get there I'M JUST WATCHING TV.  Why do I have to travel into the city on a cold night in the middle of winter, and wait outside of the arena for 25 minutes, if the show was this bad?  They advertised The Undertaker and DX for the 25th anniversary but then they weren't in the same building.  Even if the Undertaker and DX come it really doesn't matter, as they are no longer relevant and are no longer part of the story lines.  They are just a couple of catch phrases and T-shirts now.  Next, there were 30 minutes worth of backstage segments which I am, again, watching on the Barclay's televisions.  How do I even know that these people are backstage at the Barclay's Center and why do I even care about all of these things going on backstage?  Look, if you're going to force me to watch interviews, celebrations, reunions, and matches at the Manhattan Center when I paid to see a show at the Barclay's center, at least don't also place 30 minutes of backstage interviews into the same show.  Absolutely ridiculous.  What also annoyed me most was the WWE fans.  After 2 hours most of the people had to realize that this was a bad show, yet the people still got equally exited when the Dudley Boys came out during the Slater and Rhino match.  As if everything is okay just because some past-their-prime Dudley boys come out for one single simple meaningless appearance.  I use to like wrestling because the stories were connected, the people were athletic, and the matches meant something, why do people get so exited when unconnected stories like the Dudleys coming out take place, -
 Dudleys who were passed their prime a year ago when they made their final run.  Then you tell me CHris Jericho is coming back - again back-stage, again let down.  If people like the Dudleys so much they can go to a ROH show, or an autograph signing  in a comic book store.  When people cheer them so vehemently at this WWE show they tell the WWE that they like this show at the Barclay's center which certainly was probably one of the worst live shows, wrestling wise, they will ever put on.  Again, the opening segment with Austin and the McMahon's has no connectivity to the overall picture in the WWE.  I like Austin but I really would rather have seen some meaningful matches then him barely lifting his leg to give low-impact stunners to the McMahon.  Big deal.  Then there was an interview, backstage again of course as if they were purposely cheating the fans, with AJ Styles.  Again this was after the 2 hour mark when everyone should have realized they were jipped, cheated, and ripped off.  But still the fans idolize wrestlers and they don't let the WWE know that the WWE did a dishonest and slimeballish thing by putting on the show that they put on like they did at the Barclay's Center.  When AJ styles said, because I'm A-J-STYLES why did the whole audience have to repeat it like they would were he live in the middle of the ring during an honest and upright WWE show?  At the same time, how does AJ Styles even act so confident when he knows that the fans in that arena aren't getting their money's worth or a fair show?  It's not even the booking I hold to blame, but the superstars as well for being themselves when the show was so bad.  Again, you're falling into he WWE's net, and by your participation in such a way during such a show you're telling the WWE that they're doing a good job when really they put on a knavish and thievish show.  Now, finally, let's understand why the WWE put on such a show.  They did it because their television contract is about to end and they want to get a higher television contract.  What better way to do this then to book a show from 2 arenas which will increase television viewership because of the hype and interest surrounding such a unique show.  The WWE had no regard for the fans in attendance, and they simply staged a show for the television audiences and their own profits caring NOTHING for the people in attendance at these shows.  That's all, and if money is so important to the WWE that they cheat their fans out of what the fans pay for and deserve then I won't be a part of this dishonest and Mammon dominated place any more.",-0.3099,1127
