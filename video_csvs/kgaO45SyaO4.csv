"Amazing engineering there.
Please start bringing products to market; my elderly parents could both use a robotic watchdog/helper to keep an eye on things when I'm not around for them. I'd feel a lot better if there was something like this there to call for help if they fell or had a medical emergency, and weren't able to signal anyone themselves. This looks perfect for that; it could take voice commands to call emergency services, or call automatically if there was some accident or incident, and it got no reply when prompting the senior for a response afterwards.

There are so many positive possibilities here; it's a shame that everyone is focusing on simple fear because the bots seem strange at first glance.",0.6344,136
