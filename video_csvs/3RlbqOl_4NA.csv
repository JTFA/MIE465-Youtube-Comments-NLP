".....I'm sick and tired of this not being revealed outright. the US government past and present, not revealing to the masses, over 80 years now and they are still steadfast in keeping a tight lid on it, question is, why? Well, one for sure is, they don't want their citizens knowing they themselves can't do anything about these alien creatures in invading their airspace and land space too. They don't want the masses knowing they are completely helpless and at the whim of these far-in-advanced alien entities.

 Another point, if we got contact and got to know the aliens well, the masses might in the end ask them to deal and solve our troubles, no need for governments, out of a job so to speak, sounds weird in what I just mentioned, but think about it, we would have voted aliens to rule our world as they are far in advanced than us, so makes sense we would let them kind of rule our world.",-0.3113,185

But you gotta understand the facts. The earth is an insanely rich and beauteful place in galaxy with all possibilities. And it has to be rare according to all the other stars that are basically just dust or ice. What i mean is, it will attract attention to anyone passing by. Assuming we are the only intelligent lifeform is funnily stupid. So if you look at Bob Lazars stories as i did. And you notice that over the years more and more stuff he sold us as facts became true. You can justify thinking about it more as truth. Now another big piece of evidence once again. Lazar explained how UFO¬¥s have 3 flight modes and that the third one allows the aircraft to go in his fasters mode. And when it does it turns sideways. The F18 pilot said something like it fired himself up throught the clouds like a bullet from a cannon and left a giant hole in the clouds.

"Forget that this has anything to do with aliens or spaceships from another world.

If you were a fighter pilot on a training mission then all of a sudden you receive a radio call from your aircraft carrier saying you are now diverted to a ""real world"" tasking.

Your task now is to head Southwest for 100 miles to intercept a possible rogue aircraft, perhaps from another country.

When you and your wingman got there, you saw a tic-tac shaped object hovering above the ocean - no wings, no rotors, no exhaust.

Then, as you and your wingman circle it for a better look, it darted to a higher altitude and made a left turn.

You and your wingman followed suit (turned left to follow it).

You got your Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and radar on and confirmed along with your eyesight that it's a real object and that your eyes didn't play tricks on you.

You also recall that your aircraft carrier's powerful and most advanced radar directed you to the object so it obviously is a solid object and not a mirage.

So, you got 4 instruments that all confirmed its existence: your FLIR, your carrier's radar, your own aircraft's radar, and your eyes IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

Not only that, three other aviators also saw what you're seeing.

Still not knowing what the object was, you decided to cross that circle you've been making with the object and head directly at it for a better look.

As soon as you got to within 1/2 mile of the object, it suddenly sped off at a speed you've never seen in the entire 18 years you've been in the Navy.

What would be your conclusion of what that object was?",0.4073,323

"I spent six years as a Navy ET trained AT working on the very technology used in this video. There's even a possibility that I worked on this very specific FLIR pod at some point in 2004. I did a mixture of I level O level and Depot level work at an AIMD and mostly worked with civilian tech reps. 

I can tell you that without a doubt, this is not a foreign object inside the pod or on the jet itself. If something were inside of the pod it would just be a huge inditinguishable shadowing or at least a partial blackout of the video. Part of my job was to ensure foreign debris stayed out of the pod. 

In my opinion the object aura and the slight bouncing etc on the screen and the way the FLIR uses it's boresight is legit. It would be hard for someone to hoax this let alone be familiar enough with the way f18 specific electro optics systems behave. 

Just my cents. If it makes any sense at all ;).",0.3632,189

The Bradley has a red and black or red and white thermal infrared system that can see out 20 kilometers. It also can laze objects to gauge distance. Late one night, an airborne object appeared in the sights and we lazed it at 5 clicks. It then moved rapidly back and forth, left and right (just as these Navy pilots observed) at a high rate of speed and change in direction ranging from 5km to 20km. It moved faster than anything we had ever seen and must have been pushing G Forces in excess of 15G. Then it vanished and that was it.

IR artifact generated by rotating camera elements in the gimbal.  People have reproduced the effect in home made experiments.

It may very well be a flying saucer full of little green men from Mars but we don't know that yet. And trying to make it about them before we know the full story is just being stupid.",-0.7471,84

"This is the TacPack A/A forward looking FLIR video simulation/VR Superbug platform that can be downloaded.  Definitely no UFO here.  Google the following--

The TacPack tactical combat engine and SDK for FSX/P3D ""allows the addition (via the TacPack SDK) of functional weapons and other tactical systems to TacPack Powered aircraft.""  
      Verbatim:  These aircraft are developed by VRS and third-parties. The TacPack also provides an interface for user-deployable  AI such as surface to air threats, aircraft carriers, drones, and aerial refueling tankers. The TacPack is NOT a game containing scripted or dynamically generated missions. It is a technology platform that allows developers to build (and end-users to fly) aircraft which utilize true combat systems in both single and multi-player. These systems include accurately modeled weapons and other tactical systems such as FLIR video, ground-mapping radar, etc., to be exploited by third-parties in their own aircraft with the help of the TacPack SDK. 

Ladies and gents, what you are seeing is the end user running a combat simulation using FLIR video, whereby he or she is moving and tracking other simulated friends or foes in a single player or multi-player tactical simulation.",-0.8481,223

"We have to realize that we all come into our lives for different purposes & lessons. not everyone is here at this time, in this reality to learn this kind of information. some even have automatic physical or violent reactions to it, but they don't actually know why, yet.  it's a type of natural brainwashing, a ""veil"" if you will. it's normal for them and appropriate. it's not bad. So people should not try and force it, or try to convince people who don't want to hear about it. some people are here for largely religious dogmatic types of experiences, and life beyond the outer surfaces of this planet doesn't fit their paradigm. But if you are here in the year 2018 and are ready to take in everything that's out there, you have the whole frontier ahead of you. and one thing about stepping out: you can always come back.",0.6221,171

"You know, not really sure really happened here and I have read through everything I can find on this incident.  The radar analysis from the Princeton is one of the stranger parts of the whole thing I think.  Regardless of what this actually was, I am rather tired of people who say that it is false because the military has tech that would have produced a much better infrared image.  Seriously?  Have you ever seen military footage on the news before?  Even recently?  Geez, just search through YouTube itself and you can find military footage examples from more recent time periods that are just as unsatisfactory regarding resolution and other image attributes.  Regardless of which side you take (if any), at least do a tiny bit of fact checking before you commenting like some sort of established authority or something.
