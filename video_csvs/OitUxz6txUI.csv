"Corporations need to provide health insurance to all their employees who work more than 20 hours a week. They got their tax break, now they need to earn it.

"Don’t these fools realize this is just another scam to extract taxpayer wealth from what’s left of the peoples’ government while exploiting the poorest in society? J.P. Morgan and Dimon already make money from administering food-stamps on behalf of the corporate government, giving a subsistence existence to the working poor, and now they want to appease their slaves with subsistence health care. But there is another side to this and it is far more insidious. As the Oligarch-Trump administration slowly defunds every facet of government healthcare, the labor market will loosen as the working poor will take any job to be able to access healthcare. Those that are approaching and now fill the ranks of the underemployed and precariat underclass will have no other option as the sicker they get, the more dependent they will become on any job, not only to eat with the aid of food-stamps, but to access healthcare with the help of their benevolent masters. I can understand the strategy of the oligarchs; in all aspects of society they are creating a dependency on the corporate fascist government by leveraging healthcare to benefit the oligarchs. Remember, when you are totally dependent on a master, you are worse than a slave. For the oligarchs, they see the end of democracy coming but it is not here yet. They need an alternative should the wishes of the people about single-payer government healthcare ever penetrate the ""democratic"" filters of the ""Democratic"" politicians. And media outlets like CNBC, CNN, and MSNBC will help the oligarchs sell this to the population to indoctrinate and enslave.",-0.1154,298
