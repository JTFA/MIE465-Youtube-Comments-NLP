Anyway, my PSA level was ridiculously low, nearly 7 times lower than his, and I feel safe enough on that account. Of course time has taken its toll, like it does with everyone else (I suppose), but I shouldn't complain.

Maybe it is because cancer is something most people do not understand and fear, thus anyone that can be linked to cancer is memorable. I can not say i recognize the notion of people being ""cancerous"" unless we are talking about the metaphorical kind.

"Mr. Fry, you are a very strong and brave man.  My father had prostate cancer (Gleason grade 9)  years ago and had a prostatectomy.  He has gone through his treatments, radiation, and some other medication that he took for a couple of years, and has been cancer free for many years (he is 70).  All of this after he had already had a heart attack and had a triple bypass.  He is back to doing all of the things that he did prior to all of that.  In the age we live in prostate cancer is very treatable.  I hope that you heal quickly and that you have a good support base, not only from friends and family, but also a prostate cancer support group.  Please continue with follow-ups and take care of you.   Also, thank you for supporting the idea of men getting their PSA checked.  In the US, unfortunately, they are advising men not to have their PSA checked as often as they had in the past and I believe it will be detrimental for many men and their families and friends.  Again, THANK YOU!  <3",0.9274,214

"Often near-death experiences lead to prayers for relief, recovery, forgiveness, etc., and  I was wondering if it did for him.  Someone said ""There are no atheists in foxholes"".  Guess I'm testing that theory.  Christians are often accused of being hypocrites.  So is an atheist that prays a hypocrite?  Or are they a (potential) new Christian?  I suspect that 98% of the time, a ""Please God, Don't Let Me Die"" Christian is once again, after ""Oh Thank God I Survived"", an atheist.  Who's the hypocrite now?  That's all.",0.9133,114

"One of the many mysteries of life is why people will post 'thumbs down' verdicts on all Youtube videos. No matter how innocuous the subject, no matter how interesting and informative they may be, there is always a band of those who 'dislike' - although exactly why is generally never revealed.

Anyone with normal human feelings will relate to Stephen Fry's revelations. He is an extremely rare man in so many ways: he has every reason to be arrogant, egotistical and a total pain-in-the-arse - yet he comes across as a 100% decent guy. So how come more than one-and-a-half-thousand people don't like this video? Truly amazing.

Mr Fry, if you ever read any of these comments - which, thank goodness are almost all supportive - I can assure you that any decent person is rooting for your full recovery. National treasures are few in number. We can ill-afford to lose any of them.",0.8595,174

Also, I enjoyed your recent performance with Adriaan van Dis very much. You're such a wonderfull storyteller. I hope you have many more stories for us to come.

"Well done by the doctors with the early intervention, that really is what saves most survivors of cancer (several people in my family had aggressive forms of cancers, but most of them were fortunate enough to have it discovered early on.)

i'm sorry but stephen really has the softest voice and lull me off to sleep even on such an important topic. not that anything he said was boring because i actually found all the stages and processes rather fascinating but imagine listening to morgan freeman reading a declaration of world war 3. a very smooth voice. i kind of wonder how this would work with me because i've been told i have wandering lymph nodes. might make removing them rather difficult.,-0.296,86
