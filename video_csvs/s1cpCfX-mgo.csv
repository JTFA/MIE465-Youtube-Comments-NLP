"Incubus? Are you fucking serious? This is a let down. What a fucking piece of watered down pop shit. I am so disappointed in this band now. They are a shadow of their former selves.

I can be certain they really suck now""
I'm done with them.",-0.9547,91
"Ive never been a guy to say go back to this or that albums sound. But I dont like this sound at all period. You guys SHOULD just go back to science or morning view, shit even If not now, when? was 10x better than this. These songs aren't replay button material. Maybe just familiar faces. Get rid of skrillex. Not sorry",-0.4784,71

"Lyrics
I have forgotten what it feels like
I don’t remember it’s true
It will take all I have left to make this right
But I’d like to try it with you
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been tonight
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been, that’s right
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been tonight
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been tonight
I have forgotten what it tastes like
I don’t remember, do you?
Oh, it’ll take all I have left to work this out
Oh, push on ‘til I’m breaking through
Oh, I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been tonight
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been tonight
I’m inspired by your proposition, but I don’t trust my intuition
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been tonight
Yours is the curtain that I’d like to pull back
But I can’t be certain that you’re really real
Yours is the curtain that I’d like to pull back
But I can’t be certain that you’re really real
Real
Are you really, really real?
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been tonight
I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been, that’s right
I’m inspired by your proposition but I don’t trust my intuition
So I guess I’m going digital tonight
