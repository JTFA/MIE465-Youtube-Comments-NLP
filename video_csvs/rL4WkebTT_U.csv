About the best view: totally agree with Mori Tower. Not only because of its location, but also because it's a rooftop instead of standing behind glass. Skytree is probably the worst, especially at night you're seeing so many reflections in the glass you hardly see anything outside.

But indeed, nothing beats a helicopter. During my second visit to Japan in 2008, I actually did a helicopter tour above Tokyo at night, that was just as amazing as you would expect. I see Excel Air (https://urayasu1e.excel-air.com/) still offers similar tours, although they have about doubled in price since I went.

"Not many people go to this but one of the best spots that is also free is the New York Bar at the top of the Hyatt Park Hotel, the same hotel in Lost in Translation.  Although if you stay after 8pm there is a cover charge.  But being on the 52nd floor it is higher than the Mori Tower, Metropolitan Government Building or Tokyo Tower and you get to see all of them (and the Hyatt Park Hotel is kinda inconspicuous anyway in the skyline).  The only snag is to stay you probably need to get a beer, but then you get a beer and a view for less money than the cost of Mori Tower or Skytree.  There is also the added romantic element of Lost in Translation, and if you are willing to pay the cover charge, there is live music to go with the view.  

Great view - Check
Live music to add into the romantic element - check
Tie in with a great movie - check
Drinks in hand - check
Cheaper than all the others (apart from MGB) - Check

The best thing is that there is hardly anyone else doing it because it can feel a little intimidating to go up to a hotel bar that you are not staying in, you need to go past 2 sets of elevators, front desks staffs but it is a better ""date"" than just being a tourist going for a view.",0.9905,265

"What kind of friends?  The short answer is to stay in hostels. Look at the comments to see what kind of people go to that hostel and what the social environment is like. Since those people will be there a few days at a time, that's the best way to meet people from other places around the world who probably speak fairly good English.

If you're actually trying to meet some Japanese people at the hostels, then that's a little bit trickier. The solo Japanese people staying at things like hostels are very likely there for just a night or two to do interviews or some other sort of business.  In any case, no matter who it is... a good way to make friends in the hostels is to pick one with a decent sized common room that people likely actually hang out in but without an in house bar... and come back at night with a bunch of beer and chu-hi and maybe a few snacks, and offer them out freely.

Really really want to try to meet Japanese people? In that case, I'd suggest looking for an airbnb host that is doing airbnb to meet people. Some hosts you may never see. Look at the reviews for ones where the host shows people around, etc. Of course, even that sort of host doesn't have the time or money to do all sorts of stuff with you. In which case you pretty much have to break down and talk to random people the old fashioned way. I don't care for bars, though that works. I suggest parks, festivals and... if you're 14-32 or so, college campuses. Lastly, if you have an interest in something specific, there's your other natural in.  Like baseball? Go to baseball. See if anyone near you looks friend-able. But most of these you run a strong chance of mostly running into people not very comfortable with English, and they're all strongly based on your personal charisma. Also, if we're talking relatively young people, they're mostly using Line these days AFAIK... so, set it up in advance.",0.9883,392
