AHHHHH I LOVE ADAM DRIVER SOOO MUCH!!,0.6988,9
"Adam Driver is going to win an Oscar someday. Maybe all the Oscars. I have so much trouble reconciling the same guy playing stoic, yet contradictory emo, Kylo Ren and that crazy Adam Sackler on Girls.  Whoever cast him would have had to look very hard to find bits of Kylo Ren in the Sackler character. Hints are in Girls, but it's so fleeting on the stoic part. It's more obvious when Sackler gets angry and throws things around. Season 2 episode 10 shows a pre-cursor to light saber skills as he whacks his boat apart with a long piece of lumber.",-0.7496,112
