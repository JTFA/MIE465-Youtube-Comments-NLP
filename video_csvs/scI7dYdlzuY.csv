"Everyone yells cover up like Penn State and Paterno paid off every victim, parent, the police and the district attorney’s office for 40 years.   In 1995, the adoption court failed to discover Sandusky when Matt Sandusky was placed in Sandsusky’s house despite his biological mother’s concerns.   In 1998 Sandusky admitted inappropriate behavior to one victim’s mother, police detectives and an investigator from Department of Public Welfare.   In 2002, McQuery spoke to his dad and a neighbor before going to Joe and police.  Instead of stopping Sandusky or following up with the police, McQuery attended a Sandusky golf fundraiser in 2003.   Second Mile didn’t investigate Sandusky until 2008.  There is nothing to show Joe stopped the truth about Sandusky from getting out.  The fact is, nobody is asking why the police,  the district attorney’s office and Child Protective Services didn’t step in sooner than 2009.",-0.4019,174

"Fucking gross that you guys are trying to profit off of this. I’m an Iowa Hawkeye fan. I used have more respect for Penn State than any other Big Ten program. Now I can’t even imagine rooting for them. Their program knew and covered up at every fucking level and it’s disgusting. Should have been given the death penalty. At the Iowa/PSU game this year I saw little kids in Penn State gear. I guess it’s easy to judge, but I literally don’t think I could raise my kids as Iowa fan if I knew that every single memory I have of them was tainted by the fact that our entire staff was covering up a child rape operation

Edit: also, it would be one thing if the administration had totally made everything right. But they dodged sanctions, their coach is a complete asshole and clearly unintelligent, and literally the majority of their fans want their wins reinstated and want a Joe Pa’s statue back. Just disgusting. Some things are bigger than sports",-0.7003,202

"It's a tragedy all around, but the person who did the abuse, Sandusky, was the cause of it all.  Also, me thinks that Paterno's response to the crisis may be generational, same with the old Boy Scout and Catholic Priest pedophile scandals, when it was typical to cover everything up in order to avoid societal embarrassment.  But, in the end, a legacy was tarnished because too many people were willing to turn a blind eye over a sex pervert's escapades.",-0.9817,91

After a search the hard drive was also found in the river but it had been smashed & it's data unrecoverable.  Maybe Joe knew, & maybe he didn't.  But, one thing is for sure - a hell of a lot of people got away with raping kids (and probably still are) because they successfully diverted all the attention onto Paterno.",-0.9136,155
