"Boycotting Pro-Israel Actors - Gal Gadot


Gal Gadot is an ex-IDF member and a supporter of Israel


From:


https://www.cufi.org/wonder-woman-gal-gadot-on-israel-gaza-israeli-actresss-pro-idf-stance-causes-controversy/


I have boycotted every film that I am aware of in which she appears.


- Wonder Woman

- Superman vs Batman - Dawn of Justice

- The Justice League


There are others

""Gal Gadot is an Israeli actress, singer, martial artist, and model. She was born in Rosh Ha'ayin, Israel, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. Her parents are Irit, a teacher, and Michael, an engineer, who is a sixth-generation Israeli. She served in the IDF for two years, and won the Miss Israel title in 2004.""

This is the kind of IDF activity that Gadot supports
