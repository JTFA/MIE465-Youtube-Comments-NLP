"@JohnCampea Success of the Movies should not based purely on box office openings but rather wait until the run ends.

Therefore they rather wait for reviews & word-of-mouth to determine if it's worth the time. I felt JL is really really good. Perhaps ZS absence from the movie prob makes a huge difference.",0.9202,91
"After amazing work of wonder woman, although i think it justice league was a decent film, it was dissapointing to see DCEU take step back after amazing progress Wonder woman made for DCEU. Think clear message was sent to Warner Bros, that they need to be more patient & focus on developing each character first in their own solo films before trying to cram them all in one movie. I realise WB is in a disadvanathed position & trying to play catch up to Disney/Marvel who've had many years heads start to develop MCU. Before avengers became money making juggernaut it is now, Disney made many solo character based movies building up their character before amalgamating them all into avengers cross overs movie. Problem with WB is that they tried to amalgamate all their characters into Justoce league after onky one solo film ie Man of steel was only film made before developing one character before their 1st real 'amalgamation' justice league character based movie in batman vs superman. Problem now is WB clearly have already developed & stsrted DCEU with a bad negative perception in mainstream media & consumers with overall negative launch of DCEU with batman vs superman. Althougj some of this negative perception was over come with success of wonder woman, justice league's lacklustre & dissappinting performance has onky reinforces this genwral negative perception of DCEU in mainstream media & consumers. There is still hope for WB's DCEU but WB needs to focus on solo films that focus more developinh each character before trying to continue pushing major character amalgamation 'Justice league' films with lots of characters jammed into it",0.8807,291
"Although I did find Justice League somewhat entertaining, the numbers don't lie. Warner Bros shot themselves and DC in the foot from the start. Their studio heads have made too many poor decisions including micromanaging their filmmakers and writers to the detriment of the final product. Half baked distorted Frankenstein films that are destroying amazing heroes and villains. All WB  seemed to be concerned about was playing catching up to Marvel and making money.  Marvel took there time and built their universe piece by beautiful piece, paying careful attention to their character development and learning from their mistakes.This is not a Marvel or DC thing cause I love both. I just want amazing movies. A film  like Justice league should be an epic triumph with fans and the box office. Not beaten by a crock of a movie like suicide squad. I feel sad for everyone associated with wonder woman. A light in a very dark place. They better think long an hard where they go from here.

DC knows that Marvel is making tons of money, but have no idea how or why. All DC had to do was do what Marvel did, but they didn't. They seem to be making movies by committee. And it is clear that Zack  Snyder hates Superman and wants everything to be a dark, gritty, black and white Batman, Dark Knight movie.

"Hey John, I think you can see a pattern after Suicide Squad. Box office numbers you posted in order of release:
Man of Steel: 116 million - - - First movie in the DCEU, respectable number on an iconic character
Batman vs Superman: 166 million - - - Great number on two of the greatest comic book characters. First grumblings on bad reviews
Suicide Squad: 135 million - - - Good number for opening weekend, but reviews are killing it, and trailers not quite the same as the movie, even though there were big stars. Supposed to be the DCEU's version of Guardians of the Galaxy.
Wonder Woman: 103 million - - - Great movie, but I think people were apprehensive to see it until reviews were all in because of the track record.
Justice League: 96 million - - - People are not going because they are not impressed with the DCEU, and wait for reviews. 

Do people wait to see Marvel movies, or wait to see reviews? No, because Disney/Marvel let reviewers get their reviews out early, because their movies are just more fun. These DCEU movies have been watchable (Suicide Squad) to good (Wonder Woman). And even though most of the Marvel movies are in the higher end of reviewed movies, I think people have more fun at them.

Personally, I think they should have waited to bring out Justice League, and had Flash, Aquaman, and maybe even a Martian Manhunter movie BEFORE JL. It's not like Marvel cornered the market and trademarked their winning formula. I'm not sure why the execs at WB were thinking, other then a straight money grab. I think fans are starting to see that writing on the wall.",0.9884,329

How is this bad for Marvel? Thor Ragnarok is on track to make almost a billion globally. Thor will perform better than a DC movie with their all their big guns. Marvel put in the work and DC didn't. Hopefully they go back to the drawing board. These characters deserve to be in better movies. Maybe the start a DC studios thing like Marvel. Give them some autonomy. Maybe just do stand alone movies instead of a connected universe.,0.8083,88
I agree with John. WB just kept making to many mistakes with DC characters. Way way to fast in trying to keep up with what Marvel took years to accomplish.,0.6808,33
"I agree, the dark tone is a scapegoat. BvS was filled with plotholes, ruined Lex Luthor and blew DC's load to early by trying to skip over solo movies. They skipped straight to their own version of Civil War before Marvel did, even though Marvel were the ones who had a decade to build their universe up. They killed Superman off two movies in even though they were obviously just going to bring him back. Had we given a shit about this Superman yet maybe it would have carried some dramatic tension but we barely know him. We barely know any of these people!

Why do they think the audience cares if Batman fights Superman? We barely met Superman and we didn't at all know this Batman, meaning they had to spend a significant chunk of BvS giving us backstory. Suicide Squad ran into the same problem and could have fulfilled a niche Marvel cannot, having good villains. We should have already met Harley Quinn and Deadshot before giving them a team up film, then they could have spent more time emulating the humor from Guardians of the Galaxy that they wanted to copy so much. Justice League had to introduce Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman then build up to the final fight with the villain which even before the film was released was obviously a lot to juggle. Hell why do they think Wonder Woman was so well liked? It's a standalone. Same reason that (although a lot of people don't like it) that I like Man of Steel.",-0.6393,282
"I can say as a non-DC fan but someone who loves the Marvel movies, the fanboys and fangirls severely underestimated how much audiences despised BvS. In my circles, most people declared it the worst film of 2016 (I wouldn't go that far, but it was very bad). Suicide Squad was enjoyed a little more but most of my friends and family were disappointed by it still.

I had to persuade people to check out Wonder Woman because they didn't trust DC at this stage. Everyone who saw it loved it and thought it was one of the best comic book films of all time (I am a woman and my friends are mostly female so it was extra special). However as a casual fan nothing about Justice League's trailers, story, cast or anything caught my eye. The trailers reminded me too much of BvS and the plot looked all over the place.

When me and my friends were backstage talking about arranging a cinema night out, one of them said ""What about that Justice League thing?"". I didn't want to see it but I assumed most people would since we all loved Wonder Woman so much. However, to my shock, everyone said no with one of my closest friends saying Batman vs Superman was so bad she'll only see Wonder Woman movies from DC. Most others concurred and said they had lost all trust in the DCEU after BvS. We ended up seeing Thor Ragnarok a second time and we all loved every second.

In short, I don't think the comic book fanbase understands how much the mainstream audience hated BvS.",-0.3796,300

"I don't agree with the ""symbiotic relationship"" statement. The MCU doesn't need the DCEU. The MCU built a solid fan base over multiple movies, building their stories. DC assumed everyone read the comics and tried a shortcut to try and catch up to the MCU. DCEU fanboys watched JL up to 6 times and it still crashed and burned.

"I honestly feel bad for the actors. They're really trying yet the executives have completely and utterly failed them and the audience. Of course the blame will be put on a grieving Snyder and unfortunate Whedon but really this was an issue of planning. I have no idea why Suicide Squad was green lit before Justice League, and more importantly why they didn't make Batman a bigger part of the film. I don't understand who greenlighted BvS and all the shit that went into that ridiculous film. Wonder Woman was good because they under estimated the film and didn't meddle. Now Justice League has unabashedly flopped and they're STILL doing damage control which started with Man of Steel. The executives fucked up the Justice League's first outing and that's going down in history, just like Avengers and The Dark Knight. End of Story.",0.1434,154
I just saw justice league and this is comeing from someone who love marvel and heats everything DC has done I came out saying not bad had problums but not bad and I been thinking why and it's so clear it because of superman he's so great in this movie and it's good to see him being treated right and not just some dark batman type superman but superman was about.

"I think critics played a factor honestly. Rotten Tomatoes averages hold a lot of water with casual fans. Honestly there isn't just an appetite for the DC characters as much as there is for marvel. There is an appetite for sure but I think Marvel taking the time to lay a foundation of one or two standalone movies per character at a time when the concept of the shared universe was new and beating DC to the punch so to speak was a huge factor. I think given the timeframe it had Justice League did a fine job of getting people invested in the characters but you can't compete with a 5-6 year slate of invididual buildup standalone films. Also people seem to like the "" real life cartoon' approach marvel has taken with their movies. Critical react thats positive also builds on itself just as critical reaction that is negative does. I think Wonder Woman was a true gem, and I would say my 3 favorite DCEU films are 1) Wonderwoman 2) Man of Steel 3) Justice League. I think they are going in a good direction but they need to adjust their expectations and budgets. Shoot for a 600-700 million box office take. Scale back some of the insane actor budgets and marketing budgets. If BA feels he's getting underpaid go out and get someone else etc. Give Gadot her due bc she's a proven quantity. Negotiate with the other actors.",0.9815,262

They made the movie relevant to our society and than went the all mighty and extraordinary path of the superheroes genre by introducing Thor, Vision and you might even say Captain America. The way they ended they movies was a strike of genius, it peaked the interest of the movie goers who were asking for more. One thing you fail to mention John is that financial success does not always reflect what people really think about the movie, take for instance Batman V Superman it was a financial success only because for a lot of people seeing Batman and Superman in the same universe sharing the silver screen at the same time was a dream come true but for a lot of us, including me, that dream became a nightmare. 
Seriously, going to the movie theatre now a days is an expensive adventure, my friend is married with 5 children, he saw BvS with his kids who love Superman and Batman, he's not rich and he wasted more than 100 💵 on tickets, drinks and popcorn, needless to say he and his kids were extremely disappointed with the movie, so guess what? Do you think he went to watch the Justice league knowing all the production problems with the director? I let you answer that question. So don't pretend the box office number for the Justice league is going to affect Marvel Studio money because they don't operate the same way that WB does.",0.9928,351

"Just because DC movies aren't good doesn't mean people are going to stop seeing comic book movies. People can actually tell the difference between Marvel and DC movies you know. I like both DC and Marvel (I know, what a shock), but DC movies are just shit. I feel like their animated and comic books are are better, but Marvel know what they're doing on the big screen. The only BAD movie I can remember from Marvel was Thor: 2. Some were average but for the most part they're good. So people have faith in Marvel and Kevin Feige. So just because DC is doing bad, doesn't mean Marvel are going to be bad. 

I personally didn't mind JL. It wasn't good but wasn't bad. I would give it a 6.5/10 and to me, that's average. I thought Thor: Ragnarok was 8 or 8.5/10. I don't know why people are mad at Thor. SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! I thought they could have made the destruction of Asgard and the death of Odin a bit more dramatic and emotional, but they did say Asgard isn't a place but the people. I thought that was a good enough explanation. I genuinly thought it was hilarious not like when the Flash falls down and lands on top of Wonder Woman. That was cringe worthy. Everybody has their opinion but to me, the movie should have been well over 2 hours. For a Batman movie, we don't need it to be, because everybody knows the origin of Batman. You can literally watch Batman Begins if you don't. So all they have to do is focus on the villain, and then show the conflict between the 2. There were 3 new heroes and a villain JL had to focus on. They DCU was poorly planned and executed. I think they should reboot with Flashpoint.",-0.9593,353

I am a fan of all comic book movies but DCEU is just fucking up their movies because they are chopped up messes with no heart. Wonder woman was great. Wonder woman obviously did not get interference from the big machine. Directors need to protect their work. A director of any movie should have complete control over their baby. If you have a company pushing you around telling you what you should do than the director is better off walking away. I don't know how the business works but it seems that it is the producers and management are messing up their product. Stand alone would be fine with me. I don't think they can continue down this road. I still can not forget that pa Kent would not let his son save him from a tornado. I can not let it go. It is so stupid and unreal. At that point Clark and his father were no longer human to me. General Zod was the sanest person now in this movie. Just start all over. I hate the Flash character. What a goof they made him out to be. I think Batman can come to  television. We need to see a younger Batman. Enough of the movie version of Batman. Batman is the one character that can be done on television and they should. The Bat family can bring a huge about of character plots and character building to a weekly show.

They arent connecting things for people to hold on to. Even Thor Ragnarok had all kinds of stuff in it that youd just have to have seen the other movies to understand and laugh at. In short...

First of all I want to start by saying that I didn't like Man of Steel,  I didn't like Suicide Squad and I thought Batman v Superman was ok. Having said that, I loved Wonder Woman and thought Justice League was a fun movie. We haven't seen Aquaman yet but Warner Brothers has and maybe it's a great movie as well as Wonder Woman 2 might be a great movie, and then none other than Matt Reeves will direct The Batman,  so now we may have 3 great movies that will be rebuilding a foundation. Also if you add into the equation that characters in Justice League such as The Flash,  Aquaman and Cyborg were loved by audiences, it's a team that has lots of potential and also remember that Suicide Squad 2 will have a different director and guess what? Zack Snyder is out of the game so I see that it's a lot riskier to reboot. They have the foundation, just fix it, mix it well and who knows, we may see something marvelous happen in DC. Just look at the Fast and the Furious example. People want to see good movies and will reconcile  with DC if they knock it out of the park with the upcoming films and I think they will.",0.9953,261
"Sorry, John, but Kevin Feige and Marvel are laughing their asses off over this debacle. The DC universe imploding has nothing to do with the overall health of the comic book movie genre. It has to do with DC shooting themselves in the foot over and over again and not learning a damn thing from it. You think Marvel believes they're in trouble? They're popping the champagne over their dominance in the theater. Marvel has had skin in the movie game for a long time, and they had plenty of time to figure out what works. DC is flailing and in over their heads, because they refuse to understand the source material, have no creative vision or drive, and are impatient and aimless. If DC can't learn the lessons of Marvel Studios, then DC Entertainment deserves to fail. Marvel isn't worried one iota about their future. Warner Brothers is. The DC comic universe isn't going anywhere, so Marvel isn't worried about them. All Marvel Studios wants to do is focus on their titles and grow.

They are barely superhero movies to begin with, Batman himself has very little screen time in each of those movies, on top of which, although he had some technology that isn't particularly real, he is just a man in a suit, with no superpowers. Nolan's films were a little dark, but they weren't BLEAK or humorless. 

I think one of the reasons the Nolan films did so well is because they were more crime-thrillers. And the best one of the bunch is more or less HEAT with the Joker in it.

"To be honest, I find it strange and almost disturbing to see that a lot of DCU fans think there could be probably a hidden, unknown or unseen reason (or, like you say, a conjunction of reasons) that would explain why the DCU movies are not working well… Okay, to be honest, I have always been a Marvel comic book reader. But I, nevertheless always like a good movie, especially a super-hero one, wherever it comes from ! The reason why the DCU is failing is just plain and simple : the recent movies are mediocre or ""unfinished"", the characters are not treated properly, scripts are lame, way just too simple, and I think the visuals + CGI (especially the character designs, costumes, etc.) feel, in a strange way, already dated (like a TV serie from the 90’s —> Cyborg and Flash costumes are kinda crappy, trying to look cool, but they are just a mess, IMHO), even though the films are recent. And on top of that (and this makes me uncomfortable) I truly feel WB is clearly just trying to cash out, with no true respect to the source material or the public… So, how could it go RIGHT…? Back in the days, i went to see Tim Burton’s Batman movies, I saw the Dark Knight trilogy twice and bought the blu-rays, saw the Watchmen and bought the BR too, went to see Man of Steel, and again bought the BR… But Batman V Superman is were WB lost me… That movie was clearly rushed (only bought the extended cut BR). How come WB keeps asking for reshoots for most of their movies ? Weren’t they checked an green-lit properly ? Clearly, WB don’t know what they are doing… We should stop looking for obscure reasons. The only responsible people for DCU failure is WB executives, that’s just it.
