And I don't believe Feige for a second that their weak villains were deliberate - if that was the case 100% of them would've been that weak but they weren't. They are simply not good at that and he's trying to pass it off as if they were doing it on purpose.

"Regarding MoviePass. 1.) You kept saying ""copyright"", a ""copyright"" is something you put on a work of art (film, song, poem, etc..) when we're talking about technology the IP is a patent. 2.) MoviePass was granted a patent for the process flow that Sinemia seems to be using parts of. Your opinion and my opinion of what is and isn't frivolous DOES NOT MATTER. There is an extensive vetting process the US Trademark & Patent Office requires a patent to go through. It took MoviePass years to get that patent and cost them a mint. In this case only part of the patented workflow was ""copied"" (again once a person has the patent even if it seems ridiculously obvious and not something that could be protected or should have been patentable, the person with the patent owns that process and can sue and will win if it's copied). MoviePass could win the lawsuit. Here's a link to the MoviePass patent if you're interested: https://patents.google.com/patent/US8612325B2/en?assignee=MoviePass+Inc",0.9141,193

That's it...  out of 18 films. 2 main villains, and a few side villains.
DCEU has the CGI villains. Doomsday, Steppenwolf, Ares, and Enchantress's Brother. 4 out of 5 films have cgi video game villains.

And undeveloped characters?!!!! WTF?!!! Marvel has FOCUSED on developing their main characters more than anything else... maybe you think some side characters and some villains are underdeveloped... but generally, Marvel has THE most developed characters than any other franchise out there.

I'm taking about CGI characters. Not characters who sometimes wear a costume that the filmmakers add CGI to.

Ares in wonder woman was not revealed until the end and he assumed his true CGI form. The character of Ares was a CGI character. He wasn't a human with a CGI outfit.

"happy birthday again john :).

the view report. money¬¥s boring...

should be a free market. shouldn¬¥t everything be free market? movie pass needs a time out.
theaters could always lower their ticket and concession prices to cancel these companies out.
people use them because their upset with ticket prices right? that¬¥s my thought anyway.

same as above. if they can have discounts why not just lower prices... bulls#¬§%.
think movie theaters are doing that here, though i dont know how many different theaters there¬¥re...
sf (swedish film) has a big monopoly here i think. as system bolaget our liquor chain.

happy kevin¬¥s ok :). hope he¬¥ll get better.

cavill or routh.

awards are as uninteresting as money to me.

yea if you don¬¥t want to see movies just because their old you may miss out on some gems.

think i love all kevin smith movies, cop out the least perhaps. clerk 2¬¥s great.
i like red state, tusk and yoga hosers too. jersey girl has a lot of nostalgia. 
he knows how to make a universe, just saying dc ;). he¬¥s a star wars fan too disney :).

still think that dame judi dench would be a great leia.

don¬¥t think it¬¥s fatigue over the hero or star wars movies, could be complaints due to over 
marketing and all the reports on the same thing/project. perhaps less marketing and more
movies would be better? as i¬¥ve contemplated on before.

snyder makes good looking movies.

20 years, 20 months, 20 days.

oh i¬¥m sure that joss has a batgirl story possibly more. i¬¥d be surprised if he didn¬¥t.

less marketing, less trailers, shorter trailers.

think cgi could be used less overall, only what you really can¬¥t do.

perhaps jl is a good example as how not to make a movie?

coogler and jordan works :).

sure :), more mixed overall.

love the shows.",0.9929,402
