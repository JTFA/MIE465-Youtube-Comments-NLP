"Eminem perpetuating bullshit racial tensions, the whole thing is a fucking joke. Some cops are shitty ass fucking cops, and white people get killed by more incompetent police for very little reason then black. But for some reason its a black issue instead of acknowledging its an issue that effects everyone. I think this is terrible for black youth to think this way, that all cops or white people are out just to get them. Its going to cause a lot of black people to be defeated and have a very negative way of looking at the world which is just a shit way to go through life. Instead of looking at the world like they can do anything they are going to think that the man or whoever is holding them down. Believe me, Ive been pulled over by cops probably 10 times for almost no reason, if I was black I would be like damn, these cops are really racist. No they will find any reason to pull anyone over if they are in the mood and you are driving a car that draws attention and you are young. I think this kind of mentality is more damaging to the black youth then any other thing, besides the fact that most of them dont have a father in their life. That is probably the most damaging thing of all to be honest.",-0.9923,251

I don't really like this song much but I disagree with Joe.  Eminem has a dedicated audience and like it or not he's probally the only rapper many of them listen to.  What I mean is he's putting this message out there for people who might not actually understand what's going on with a lot of the black community or have never even really thought about it.  I obviously don't know what's going on in his head but I really doubt he's putting this out to sell records.  How much can the money really matter to him?  I think he's smart enough to know that in the current political climate this message needs to get out there to the people who don't understand.  There's to much hate going on and as obvious and simple as this message seems it needs to be explained to people who don't know.,-0.825,155

Will the album hold up in a few years when trump is gone? Maybe not but everything can‚Äôt be a classic. Some artworks are meant to be a time capsule while others are timeless.

I think some artist get caught up in there genre if you have a love for music then you come to understand or like all music that being said i think its judgmentle to say mixing different types of music cant be done or is wrong example ive heard rumors eminems new cd is too pop i heard a few songs so far an just because a country singer or a female is on a hook dont make it pop understanding the evolution of a artist is a fans job not a critics a real day 1 fan respects the evolution or moves on for me ems political content fits up there with how i relate to  the political social environment so it feels good to share that common vibe,0.9253,130

Eminem fucking killed Joe Budden in less than 3 minutes in the Chloraseptic remix, while Joe sounds like a unleashed/uncontrolled depressed motherf*cker for over 10 minutes, who hates on Eminem because it seems to be cool to hate on him.

Yo idk why people are shitting on this album . Like some people hate change and stays in the past . He gave y‚Äôall slim shady on framed. And maybe he‚Äôs not speaking to everyone but certain people. This album spoke to me and I haven‚Äôt heard an Em album in long time that made me feel this way . I can‚Äôt lie I first heard he was coming back think this will be trash because Eminem hasn‚Äôt been the same .. but looking at this album I realize that‚Äôs the point,-0.0129,106

"You know what? After paying close attention to this interview, Joe is right! And now I know the reason why Mreck was pissed off! Eminem is one of the illest rappers to ever live and is in one of the most successful record companies that was ever made üëàüèæ Now I‚Äôm about to sound like Joe Budden here, I love that Eminem verse in the Cypher at the BET Awards, but then you doing songs like this? I don‚Äôt think this was Eminem‚Äôs idea, I blame the people (his handlers, engineers, etc and etc) the song is definitely garbage but the content is good! But, don‚Äôt use black people to fuckin sell records (I‚Äôm not talking about Em I‚Äôm talking about the label) and don‚Äôt use Em to do that üëàüèæ that I cannot like and it‚Äôs definitely disrespect seriously, I know Em didn‚Äôt feel that shit (when he made this song) and now I‚Äôm starting to think since Joe (a popular podcaster) gave his honest opinion on Untouchable üëàüèæ I think someone else drove Em to diss him and that ain‚Äôt right! I see what Joe Budden and Mreck is saying and they are right! CUT THE FUCKERY!!",0.9425,249

people saying joe should have called eminem because they have a professional relationship but why would you want to be around a bunch of Yes man regardless if he's on the label people said he should have kept his comment to himself . but it's always three sides to every story he probably said it because they don't have the relationship they  used to have anymore eminem  probably Lo key  said something about him that's why he responded back like that .. but have you ever heard of the expression tough love that's what joe doing,0.9231,96
