"What made the Original zombie trilogy (Night, Dawn, Day) so good, is that it didn't stray from certain aspects of the zombie movie. And each movie showed the zombie apocalypse at a different stage. 1. Night: The beginning (Society is first introduced) 2. Dawn: The continuation (As society is being introduced, survivors adapt) 3. Day: The end (Society has completely fallen). I do not like 'Land"" or anything after that, because it gets too comical, and it loses its roots. 

Movies like the Cure, and otehr new releases in the zombie genre are trying to make things too new, and are straying from the simplicity of good zombie horror.",-0.0648,138
