Got an idea for the gecko tape. if it is too hard to synthesize a mold, try letting a gecko itself stepping into silicone. maybe it´s possible to take its footsteps and lay them side by side and copy the over and over again, thus creating a mold. with that kind of a mold, you could focus on getting the right consistency for the final tape material.",0.2023,79

So, how safe is this light?  I'm not some safety nut wrapping my kids in bubble wrap, there's some non-obvious shit like this that is actually dangerous.

"MrTechnophile Actually, I over-simplified.  I replaced a dead motherboard on the CNC and the replacement has some kind of incompatibility with the panel's keyboard.  I've got an FPGA board on my desk right now I've wired up to go in between the two, but there's a decent amount of VHDL code to write to buffer and forward messages from both directions.  It's not a signal integrity problem, the signals on a scope look really good.  It must be some kind of timing problem.  Sometimes the ""break"" of a ""make-break"" keypress cycle doesn't make it and it acts like the key is stuck.  I don't use the mill manually to cut, I just need to get the right program loaded and started for the two ops I need from it to cut hole patterns in the enclosures for my product.  When I'm pressing buttons to move it it's moving the head through air to get to the other work station.  Still slightly dangerous, but not too bad.  If my wife wasn't involved in purchasing decisions, I would have replaced the mill long ago.

"Yeah, no. It's not that simple to say, ""It has less UV than the sun,"" Surely it's total output is less than the Sun's, but that's not the point. The Sun outputs nearly the entire em spectrum, save for ultra-high frequency em, including UVA and UVB emr. UVC never touches the ground. UVA is what our skin can detect and react to by producing melanin and giving off a burning sensation that tells us to get away. UVB/C on the other hand we cannot feel, yet it damages our skin/retinal cells much worse than UVA, along with the sensation to avoid it. Most UV lamps you can buy are the UVA type for partys. Only problem here is, this lamp is the UVB/C type. It doesn't output much UVA, therefore you cannot safely tell yourself how long you've been exposed, and your skin and eyes can't protect themselves from you. People have been seriously injured by accidently buying germicidal UVC lamps and using them as UVA party lamps. Some people have gone blind from exposure, even African people got sunburn from the lamps. Most people of European descent can't spend more than 15 mins in the Sun before they begin to sense the sensation of sunburn. Now, imagine that that same person spends a few hours under a UVB/C lamp without being able to feel it. They will be in serious trouble later with a nasty burn. It's a real problem, so don't try to minimize the seriousness of the discussion at hand. Good day, Sir!",-0.9575,297

"You're looking for Zinc SulfIDE (ZnS). As far as other colors go, you can get blue, green, yellow, orange and white phosphors. Their colors being attributable to the chemicals used (zinc sulfide being an example of a popular phosphor). Google electroluminescent phosphor for more info.",0.4215,57
"Zinc sulphate is not even mentioned on the Wikipedia. I also googled but all I got was something completely different called radioluminescence, but I saw another video featuring green neon bulbs. Now I would like to ask, what colors were available in the neon bulbs or ""glow lamps"" as they were called? I have seen orange and green but heard rumors talking abut other colors. The video with the green bulb has the Youtube video ID:vBa-u6Uwlo",0.5023,87

ipissed UV transilluminators breach the workspace 8hr UV exposure limit within 2 minutes at 50cm. That seems like something that should be avoided.

"really nice project but please be more careful with that big UV lamp. I work with these things daily and they have proofen to be skin cancer machines not to speak about the eye damages that can catch up to you years down the line. You know this but for everyone else, it looks like they produce a ""straight"" UV beam in front but they dont, they illuminat everything around them in UV. So eye protection is mandatory and i would even wear gloves if you are exposed for longer than a few seconds.",-0.3322,102

"wow, two things that surprised me, (1) Didn't think the photoelectric effect would worked through glass as shorter wavelengths would be required .  (2)  I guess the AC is enough to turn it back off, as once ionised it would normally stay on.   Nice application of theories",0.8176,55
