"+ ifeelpretty57 Tessa and Scott's SD music (The Rolling Stones and The Eagles) had a Latin rhythm overlaid on top of it, and they showed it with their dancing. Gabrielle and Guillaume have been chronically over-scored for years which is why they were 2-time World Champions to begin with. They are very talented (I've been watching them skate since they were in juniors, and I've been a fan since then), but their increase in points garnered has not been correlated with their increase in skill. They started to get higher scores *before* their skills merited those scores. It's like the skating world decided that they were going to be the next big thing, and made them untouchable accordingly.",0.9501,136
"+Quantum Witcher  I've been watching figure skating (ice dancing especially) for years, and keep pretty close track of scoring. It's definitely political. It's been political for a while. The French are good, but not that good. There were way too many 10's in Gabrielle and Guillame's Program Components section, especially given that there were a number of mistakes which were visible to regular people, let alone judges who should know what they're doing. Scoring is meant to be based on the performance actually delivered on the day, at that competition. At these Olympics, the French under-performed, but were scored as if they were skating the same way they did in the rest of the season. Tessa and Scott, on the other hand, clearly had the best skates of their season. Maia and Alex also skated better than they have all season, but their scores did not reflect that. If it isn't political, it's corruption, or both.",0.9718,183

"4eversupersonicgirl ??? If you mean they kick ass and skate incredibly every time they're on ice then yes, they skate the same damn thing every time. Virtue and Moir are amazing. It just sounds like you are salty they're so good and that the French and Shib Sibs  didn't do better. Also, your comment doesn't even make sense. All teams have a set program that they tweak all season, so Virtue and Moir are performing their same song just as the Americans and French were. Their chemistry is constantly passionate and sizzling, but that's just how they skate and how they emote. Nothing wrong with that.",0.4511,119

"4eversupersonicgirl what i meant by saying that was to sarcastically   refute your bullshit. Either way I don't see what you find so annoying about them, even though you're entitled to think that way. And despite my wording what I said still stands, my comment is not useless and your comeback was weak as hell. All skaters have a style and dance to the same programs all season. So your reasoning for finding them annoying isn't very good when all paira literally do the same thing. Tessa and Scott may usually win, yes, and skate phenomenally (but somehow make it look easy), but that doesn't make them bad or annoying. Just legendary.",-0.8176,125

"Tessa and Scott don't do the same thing every season; they have skated to virtually every style of music throughout their career. I found the Moulin Rouge program compelling, and clearly the audience in the stadium did, as well. Gabriella and Guillaume, on the other hand, didn't skate their Short Dance as well as they normally do (the wardrobe malfunction really was unfortunate), and scores ought to reflect how a team actually performs on the day. They are lucky their score for the SD wasn't lower, honestly, because the Program Components score should have been drastically different than what they were actually awarded. They were massively thrown by the wardrobe malfunction, and didn't perform anywhere near their best, even if their technical skills were still sound. I would have liked to see them perform well, but I also would have liked to see accurate judging. The Free Dance for Gabriella and Guillaume wasn't flawless, either. Did you see those twizzles? And there were a few points where they weren't synchronized in other parts of the program, as well. They weren't ""beyond perfect.""

I doubt the judges were even watching what was being done in front of them, but rather scoring based on how they remember it being performed previously. They need to get back to scoring based on how a program is performed on the day. Maia and Alex definitely skated a better short program than Gabriella and Guillaume. After Gabriella's wardrobe malfunction, she was no longer focused on skating her best, but on keeping her top on. It took the wind right out of their sails. It was extremely unfortunate, but it still happened, and it was visibly detrimental to their performance of the program. Which team skated a better long program might be up for debate, but overall I think the skating that the Shibutanis performed at the Olympics should have earned them the Silver.",0.9399,158
