As ethics go, once you accept two premises:

1. Any digital representation of you, both public and private is as superfluous as your name.

2. There is no security if you are connected. All information is public within degrees of access difficulty.

You can make a moral framework that works. Don't be an idiot, there are bad people out-there.

And I am very much being the victim. If you poke a bear, you are both a victim and an idiot. Human malevolence is a bear, technology is a forest filled with things that can harm you, great beauty and freedom but it's also a cold harsh space that the average user is completely inept of surviving without assistance and hand holding - pretending it doesn't exist only increases the number of people mauled by bears. 

The hard part is that it requires content creators, brands and society to actually educate before the fact instead of condemn after the fact - which is a real bummer.

Ofcourse to verify a video you can just automatically create a digital signature, or use a MAC. If it does not validate with the public key of the video author: faked.
But how will this translate to streaming video, where there is encoding and compression around every corner?
The video service itself could use a MAC with their public key on every second or so of video. But now you have to trust the streaming service.
There must be a way to verifiy that the generated MAC is only generateable by using compression and not actually tampering with the material. But how would you even go on and formalize something like this?

"interesting Tech, cool ideas Aunt great video.

I have some thoughts....

Technological emergence is happening much faster than our systems or our biology can compensate for....

It is what it is.

Never waste calories on fear but rather save them to spend on upgrades. ;-)

No sense in trying to save our Humanity. Humanity is just taxonomy. A temporary placeholder. A somewhat arbitrary label.

Keeping up on all of the technological advances is likely impossible even if it's your full-time job... therefore it's impossible to compensate for all of it. Power without Enlightenment, (by Enlightenment I mean scientific literacy, enhance critical thinking abilities, removal of both logical fallacy and cognitive bias and above all else recognizing complexity) is an issue we must conquer as a ""species"" if we are going to transition smoothly between variant forms.",0.8519,163
