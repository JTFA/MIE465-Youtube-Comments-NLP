No one person can speak for all of anyone one. While I supported Bernie, what I am grateful for with the past election is opening my eyes to the hypocrisy of the Left.

THE GOSSIPER: A woman repeated a story (gossip) about a neighbor. Within a few days everyone in the community knew the story. The person she talked about heard what had been said about her and she was very sad. Later, the woman (who had spread the story) learned that it was not true. She was very sorry and went to a wise man and asked what she could do to repair the damage. After giving this some thought, the wise man said to her, “Go home, get one of your feather pillows, and bring it back to me.” Surprised by the response, the woman followed his advice and went home to get a feather pillow and brought it to man. “Now,” said wise man, “open the pillow and pull out all the feathers.” Confused, the woman did what she was told to do. After a few minutes, the man said, “Now, I want you to find every one of the feathers and put them back into the pillow.” “That’s impossible,” said the woman, almost in tears. “The window is open and the wind has scattered them all over the room and blown many feathers outside. I can’t possibly find them all.” “Yes,” said the man  “And that is what happens when you gossip or tell a story about someone else. Once you talk about someone, the words fly from one person’s mouth to another, just like these feathers flew in the wind. Once you say them, you can never take them back.”",-0.724,370
