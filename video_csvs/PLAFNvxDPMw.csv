It infuriates me so much to see these products with pseudo-cubes on them.
What's worse is that I know that there are loads of intelligent and creative people in the cubing community. I don't understand why they buy things like this, and why they don't get fixed. It's like they don't even care.
It's such a simple thing to get right, and yet people seem to screw it up more often than not.

I noticed very quickly that someone had taken the stickers off and just placed them apparently randomly. It was a bit frustrating, because as a kid no one thinks you know how to solve one to begin with (even if in reality they aren't hard at all), so I imagine my discovery was probably taken as an admission that I didn't actually know how to solve one. 

Though now that I think about it, it's probably more likely that the person put the stickers on in a non standard way (so red on one side, yellow on the other, for example) and I just didn't notice.

I have a Fisher Cube. For those that don't know, it's a 3x3 rubiks cube basically rotated 45 degrees, google pictures for a better understanding. The problem is that sometimes at the 3 step of 2 Look OLL CFOP(the first step on you do for the 3rd layer) I get a position that should be impossible. On a normal rubiks cube it would translate to a figure which is 3 edges correctly oriented. If you ignore that and carry on CFOP normally, the cube will be solved except that 1 edge will be wrong.
