"As a foster child myself growing up. Watching her speak is like looking at a sister. Same energy with so much to share. The way she takes the stage and uses the history.... wow... Ive never had the courage to share publicly. Although Ive seen the beautiful impact and transformations Ive been able to be part of when I have opened and shared myself with others. Every time i watch her. Feels like home. Glad to see another one of us embracing our childhood. I feel like I can take on the world at the same time as bridge the gaps and relate to just about anyone anywhere and use that energy to heal and move so many things because of the times I faced as a child growing up in DCFS in Chicago. It was blessing in disguise I wish I could do more with and hope to one day. Too many left behind without hope and feeling lost. What I would give to other children like me... Everything I wish I had. Number 1 being...  just someone to talk to who understands and will listen, compassionate and love. Whos been through the same thing and knows how it is. Transform that energy and let them know hey its okay. ONe day like me they will look back and see how much strength and character came from those days AND hopefully use those memories to fuel and power their future 💕",0.9947,262

"I believe growing up in foster care with several different families and cultures gave me this urge as an adult to want to understand and know more. Now I live traveling world wide and in countries all over the world embracing all cultures and exploring deeper the things I wish to understand, connecting to pieces of my childhood, and just embracing life and its wonders.Never having a steady home definitely made it possible for me to feel like home anywhere in the world. Right now Im currently in India. And wow...  after a year or so back and forth living here.... Growing up tough makes you see other kids and what they have and it kinda hurts that you dont have a life thats more typical.... but India. India will humble you and give so much gratitude. Yes I grew up in really not so wonderful ways but these people live the same, and many in far worst, but its normal here. And yet they wear a smile everyday. Even when their house in on the street and made of tarps and sticks. One thing someone said to me as a child that stuck out and really rings here... ""yes dear, you may have it bad, but somewhere out there someone has it just a little worst than you""... No pain can outweigh anothers. As it all hurts the same. But definitely seeing the strength in people throughout my life is what deeply influenced me and many days kept me going 💕",-0.6861,275

"Sometimes in life as children we suffer through unbearable things no human shall ever endure. But if we can survive that. We come out stronger and sometimes just knowing you arent alone and someone else made it through it and is fine. Is all you need in that moment to keep going. Keep sharing. You never know who is listening and what impact it can have. It never makes sense why children or people get dealt the cards we do, yet if we can transform this energy we can do so many things. Even save lives. Sometimes it just takes one person to say one thing and it can change our whole life and maybe even give that hope someone needs to keep them off the edge. We never know where anyone is and children.... Wow. I remember those days.... and definitely there times a few words from a stranger may have been what kept me going and waking up one more morning.",0.9452,177
