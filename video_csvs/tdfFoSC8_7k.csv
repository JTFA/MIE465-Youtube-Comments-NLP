"In all Eons videos, there's a stylistic stipple/halftone pattern sprawled across images which supposedly looks nice. However, it doesn't move with the image it's overlaid on and wreaks havoc on the compressibility, causing blocking, jerking and fuzziness. The cause is that compression uses the fact that 2 successive frames are very similar to each other, except just moved around / warped. When the same area of an image moves in more than 1 direction, in this case the underlying image and the overlay, then it can not compress that area well. If the entire frame has this issue, then you massively sacrifice quality in the form of smoothness of movement and image detail. It can at times be tempting to just tell tech to do what you want, but tech isn't always capable of delivering what you want. Ultra high definition video, textures, 3d meshes, each blade of grass rendered, etc are all things we'd like, but tech isn't always capable of delivering or may require very high bandwidth or expensive hardware. In this case I would highly suggest removing the stipple pattern so we can enjoy high quality video.",0.578,214

"Super excited to see what you guys bring. There's not many decent youtube channels about paleontology (putting everything together as it should instead of focusing only on dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and pliosaurs as the majority of people does...) and I've seen so far that you guys have been wrecking it with your videos.

I would like, however, to make a long-time consuming request. You see, taxonomy plays a huge part in paleontology and I would love to see you show in a detailed cladogram the phylogenetic life tree of the most important domain: Eukarya. To see where evolution connects and spreads from the beginning of the Eukaryotes. If it's a pain to do kingdoms like plantae and fungii then ignore all of the other kingdoms and just start from the point where animalia comes into play. That would be AMAZING, NEW and GOLD if you actually do a detailed thing with phylum, class, order and family. (super, sub and infra included in the classification and other non-ranked ""tittles"" :P). You could give examples of species that fit the classification and why they are grouped together.

Keep up the good work ;)
