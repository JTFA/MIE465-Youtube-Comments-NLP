"First: since when Gates is a specialist in anything other than making money?; Secondly: what he fails miserably to recognize is that universal health care systems and good well functioning health insurance systems are only possible in (and a characteristic of) countries that managed to lower its innequality level, thats why Portugal is much poorer than US and still have a much better health system, you must remember that rich countries were already very very rich in 1925 but the average life spetancy were low because of deep innequality. So the answer to the health problem (like so many problems) is to cut innequality to share the wealth, not making the country much more rich while keeping it unnequal with millions uncapable of paying for private health care.

"I think many people don‚Äôt get it that the health care cost increases because of insurance (abuse). Doctors charge you for unnecessary appointments and tests because they are certain that insurance will pay them. ER is on the same line. First responders will send you in an ambulance even if there is no need, ER doctors would do all sorts of tests and scans for no obvious reason. All these services are great when you ‚Äúreally‚Äù need them but the cost hurts when you are charged unnecessarily. Insurance companies haven‚Äôt addressed the abuse, hopefully the health insurance endeavor of Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffet would address this and will bring down the cost. Innovation, that Bill Gates was talking about, is always happening and it has never brought down the cost and it would never will if we go by the trend.",-0.5267,161

"This isnt an issue strictly related to health. With the exception of some of the humanitarian-types people are generally going to go where they can make the most money. This means that anybody who lives in a 1st world country is going to tend to stay in 1st world countries and anybody who lives in a 3rd world country is going to take their first opportunity to get out. And for the 3rd world countries, the people who have the opportunity to move away tend to be the more skilled people, such as engineers and doctors.Therefore the poorer countries get poorer by losing their skilled citizens, while the rich countries get richer by attracting a larger talent pool.

So these countries can get basic primary care stuff like vaccines because these tasks relatively require less skill. Whereas the later stage diseases such as cancer require much more skilled doctors who are less likely to want to live in a third world country.

So essentially theyre stuck with this kind of treatment until they can convince upper tier doctors to live there permanently",0.8995,191
