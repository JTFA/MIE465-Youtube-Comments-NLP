"Also, more seriously, in this head cannon since all of the ponies are different pony-races, what if one of them (I'm thinking Rainbow Dash) was a bat pony, as shown in Flutterbat and Princess Luna's royal guard, and she took up her authoritative role to stop bullying, and ponies bully her because they think that bat ponies are evil since Luna controlled them, and maybe when Twilight finds out she is Luna, Rainbow Dash can comfort her and show her that she doesn't have to be evil and she can control things. I love bat ponies and all my old cringe OCs were bat ponies so I think about them a lot.",-0.9245,124
"Applejack doesn't need fixed. She's my Best Pony of the Mane 6.

Sunset Shimmer is my favorite overall character and I feel like the Equestria Girls movies were set up for her to be the lead in place of Twilight and there seems to be a clear arc going through them that is telling *her* story, but that diva Twilight keeps coming in and stealing the spotlight. If anything, the Equestria Girls Twilight should be their ongoing mad scientist antagonist and not part of the group, taking Sunset's place for herself and making Sunset feel like a seventh wheel.

Starlight Glimmer is a weird character and way too obviously similar to Twilight. Making her a featured recurring character was a mistake.

Things need to stay fresh and they need to bring in some new ideas but, even though I think they've made some serious missteps here and there, rebooting at this point seems risky. MLP:FiM is still pretty popular. Id like to see them continue with it, but have some character progression for the other characters not named Twilight. Like Rarity accidentally ruining her hair and compensating by going goth... and then actually sticking with it because she realizes she likes it and it's still her path, but a different way of looking at it. Just a different type of fashion. Or, develop some of the side characters more that are long time favorites. Etc. Is Tempest Shadow going to be brought onto the show?

My daughter's getting older and still loves MLP, but it's not her absolute favorite thing anymore. The ideas for the reboot don't sound that great. We'll stick with FiM, but if they do reboot, we're probably done with it.",0.8097,317

I don't understand why people think that an ensemble doesn't need some kind of stabilizing factor, some kind of straight man to balance out all the wild ones.  

To me, Applejack is like Koyomi from Azumanga Daioh.  She's there to emphasize the other characters and provide a level of depth.  It's perfectly fine for her to be less popular than the others.  Somebody's going to be less popular, anyway.

"They're removing Applejack because's she too white. 

Sounds ludicrous? It is. But what else is there? Girls don't understand or fantasize about being a cowgirl? Debatable but they don't fantasize about being any of those other archetypes either. They just happen to be those personality types so I guess the assumption is that there are no girls who aren't in South Africa who live on a farm and think farm life is relatable.
Again, fair enough. But where does one even run into a horse to begin with? Right, on a farm or on the countryside. Applejack is the link between the reality of them all being farm animals and them being more than just farm animals. If you wanted a vanilla horse experience you would gravitate towards Applejack. 

So the ""Little Girls"" who are heavily invested into MLP don't find Applejack interesting enough because she's more of a horse than any other character in the group and for some reason this show about talking horses has a really low draw on the ""taking care of horses"" fantasy that was basically the reason why the toy line exists at all. 

Wait, why am I even bothering to worry about this? 5 years ago I said the show would be changed in a divisive way that would sink the fandom beneath the waves. Girls don't buy toys. They get a tablet and download Talking Tom. Toys-R-Us is bankrupt. MLP is fucked as a toy brand because we're entering a post collectible era where a generation will grow up not really giving a shit about toys. 

What's going to happen to a show that exists to sell toys when toys aren't worth selling? That's the real problem worth addressing.",-0.9813,315

"why are these ponies (who by the way already were established to have their own special aptitude for magic just by being a specific race as established in g4 canon) going to one school somewhere in the forested valleys of equestria, when they previously went for specialised training in their specific area of magic (it was cloudsdale for pegasi, for earth ponies it was home training and for unicorns it was canterlot for advanced magical studies)? Im not sure why all those groups of ponies would go to a school run by Celestia when there is already such a school for each different variety of pony and how come they have to learn the appropriate magic for their specific type at this school rather than the specialized ones which already exist? Sorry but this is pretty bad, not as bad as what hasbro wants to do to applejack but it still introduces weird plot holes into the story. What is applebloom going to think when her sister is no longer a cowgirl? It's not a personality trait its a secondary trait that emphasizes her humble and honest nature. When people think southern accent they think big family dinners, togetherness and other simple things like that which are wholesome as applepie, you get it now? All of them are southern because their names also sort of fit with that type of accent Mac, Granny and AJ all have short names for each other and they are a close-knit family who works the fields and makes produce from their labor. They are, in all senses of the word, farmers and while its possible that other accents could go with this it would be too late in the game to go changing her accent or profession now, because it destroys the continuity. Im all for applejack having relatives in other places, like the seed family being a part of the apple family with babseed being the rowdy bostonite cousin to applejack and the hilarity that ensues but changing established tropes of the series just to make a quick buck is pretty dumb on hasbro's part.",-0.3778,375
