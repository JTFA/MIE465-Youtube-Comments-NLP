It was basically a little white teen girl hating the city she grew up in (still unsure what was so bad about it), can't wait to move to a ""cultured city"" like New York, and when she finally gets there she realises she misses her hometown. Throw in some cliches like romantic attempts at losing virginity, the random gay kid coming out of the closet, etc.. The best bits are all in the trailer, making it look like it could be an interesting story, but ends up displaying nothing original. Everything seems rushed for the sake of inserting as many cliches as possible, instead of delving into certain issues to draw in the audience. When there's so many beautiful creative coming of age films like 'Me, Earl & The Dying Girl', 'Juno', 'Brick', 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', 'Mysterious Skin', 'Moonlight', etc., how does this one get so much praise?",0.9581,220

"I was born and raised in Sacramento. I dare anyone who has spent time here to deny that there is a DEARTH of ethnic restaurants here in town. Compared to other California cities, Sacramento (our State CAPITAL, for Pete’s sake!) just cannot compete in terms of diversity of restaurants and attractions. I am loyal to my home city - but there is a BIG difference between loyalty and delusion.

Hey. I have never been to cities like New York, Paris, London, Vancouver, Portland, Ore, etc., but Sacramento can’t even compete with Philadelphia when it comes to food and nightlife. We can’t even compete with San Francisco. Or even Oakland. Sad. I am not a world wide traveler but I don’t have to be: I’ve seen plenty of food porn on Delicious Destinations...lol.

But, we’re getting better here, in Sacramento. In the 1970s, the only place open past 9 pm at night was 7 Eleven...

Fellow Sacramentans - if you feel someone disses our city by voicing their honest opinion, this means our fair city STILL has room for IMPROVEMENT. Right? 

Even just compared to other cities here in California - we ARE boring!!! 🙄😭
