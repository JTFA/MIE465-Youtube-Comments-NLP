There is no comparison. Hands down the Book 2 is so much more useful than any MacBook. And to top it off, Windows 10 is very solid!
...
Take off the apple logo, you have a basic laptop with Thunderbolt ports. The Book 2, is a workstation, laptop, portable gaming rig, digital artist canvas and a tablet. Oh, you can expand the hard drive space! Both cost nearly the same.
Yes, there's things I miss about the Mac OS but again, Win 10 is very versatile and can do anything you need it too at a minimal learning curve. The other thing I like about Win 10 is the 5 different ways you can choose to complete a task. Options!",0.9818,254

With the Surface I thought that the touch screen would provide me with the best of both worlds but found that using a Windows device as a tablet sucks. The icons are designed for a mouse (small and limited) and the apps designed for touch are limited. Using the pen with the Surface was not pleasant, the lag was so great that I could not use it to take notes as I wanted, the battery life when disconnected was poor and I‚Äôm not an artist so drawing on it doesn‚Äôt matter to me. 
 
I got a MacBook Pro 2016 15‚Äù and am very happy with my purchase. No more smudges on the screen from scrolling (which is what I mainly used the touch screen for) a very solid build and slim design. I love the trackpad and hate it when I have to use the one on my work computer. I run both Mac OS (free) and Windows 10 on it, using Windows 10 to play my Steam games which it does quite well (Mad Max, Tomb Raider, and many more). For a tablet, I use my iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil for taking notes and it is fantastic.
 
The ‚Äúlack‚Äù of ports on the Mac is made up for by being able to charge it from either side. The adapter clutter is no big deal to me because for desktop setups I purchased one adapter with all the ports I need and it only takes up one port on the Mac leaving three free. When I need to leave I unplug one cable and I am on my way (the adapter has a power pass-through port on it).  I have all of my Steam games loaded on a micro SD card that is installed in a tiny adapter barely bigger than the card itself, I also picked up a couple of USB C to USB 3 adapters. This all cost me $70 on Amazon. Not too bad.
 
Mac .... Windows .... I like both and can run both. Really, I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with either computer but I prefer the look, feel, trackpad, keyboard, screen and reliability of the Mac best.",0.9664,438

"You completely overlooked the ""artistic abilities"" of the Surface Book (2) ‚Äì use of a pen (illustration, photo editing, even writing or doing some rough sketches) and the SD card slot (really handy for photographers). There is the difference. And yes, it does matter, as you can use tools like Photoshop and Illustrator on the Surface Book with a Pen ‚Äì something that Apple does not give us at all (the iPad ""Pro"" has only sub-par apps in this category, and it forces us to use two devices, where one does suffice in the Windows world).
