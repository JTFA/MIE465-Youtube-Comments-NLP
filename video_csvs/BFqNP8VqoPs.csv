3D printing has limited custom prototype manufacturing use. For many years I was an engineer in heavy industrial manufacturing environments where high precision components are required to be produced in the tens or hundreds of millions of units rapidly. This can only be cost effectively done with injection or blow moulded plastics and other high speed milling processes. I do not see 3D printing replacing tried and trusted heavy industrial applications anytime soon because in real world terms it is a novelty and yet handy for small projects such as in prototype building.,0.6249,97

"After Lego finally gave in to temptation of moving some of their production to China a couple of years ago, knock off brands emerged there.

My father used to sell a particular brand of car alarms that he could only put a small amount of markup on because his competitors were also selling the same brand at a low price. His then Chinese business partner said he could get them copied in China cheaper than buying them from the actual company. So they sent a car alarm to a Chinese factory.  I assume they disassembled it, and somehow copied everything... the plastics, circuit board, even packaging.  Even though many of the components had US patents, many Chinese factories don't care, they'll counterfeit it anyway. Anyway the Chinese knockoff car alarms worked essentially the same as the more expensive brand name ones and the consumers couldn't tell.  The Chinese guy said counterfeit brand-name items can be found everywhere in the US and Canada - even in large well-known stores. I would love to see the veil pulled back a little on this industry.
