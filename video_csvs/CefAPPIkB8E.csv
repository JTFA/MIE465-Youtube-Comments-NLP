And yes, it kind of sucks when you miss actually seeing a full run of an event where an American wins something. I missed Shiffrin's run twice. I saw her qualification; however, I missed her gold medal run and even though I was able to find it on youtube, it means nothing when one cannot even see her competitors.",0.7087,106
"Thomas: That is because it is on another channel. Check USA, MSNBC, CNBC, or NBCSN. It is true that the one channel that covers everything live, NBCSN, you probably need an overpriced cable tier to be able to watch.

From what it looks like on the t.v. guide, it looks like curling is going to be on either NBCSN or CNBC.",0.7783,75
"Thomas: Well, we have no idea why they do the things they do; however, they still need to get profits from contract promises they probably made, before the Olympics came. There is a reason on weekdays that they still show Ellen, Rachel, and the news before airing the Olympics. I am not really mad about that. 

What they should have done is picked up all these small, quick events. Leave things like the Biathlon, marathon alpine skiing events, hockey, curling, and figure skating on another channel. 

They would be able to fit more variety on doing the smaller events.

I would have rather seen more speed skating, luge, skeleton, snowboarding, small skiing events (like slopestyle and aerials), etc.",0.901,143
