"Let me get this straight: YOU FIRED DANIEL O'BRIEN?!?! not only that, half of the B-team for this show that was being set up got fired too, so currently only dear sweet Katie is left at Cracked along with two other members of the B-team. 

I would be aggravated at them firing some low level writers but they fired Dan, they also fired Cody (part of the B-team and also alot of other things that were good on here) But you penny pinching knit-wits decided that rather than believing in a channel that had a series that in its first season had over 15 million views and giving them the funding necessary for that progression you decided it would be safer to lay off 19 people, some of whom were hosts, including DANIEL, I LIKED THIS SHOW, I LIKED OBESESSIVE POP CULTURE DISORDER. now the channel is ruined because the wrong people made a greedy mistake.

This channel had the potential to rise to be as popular as Rooster Teeth, Phillip DeFranco, or even WatchMojo but you ruined it because you had too little faith in the team.

Also, small update: KATIE QUIT, she now no longer works for the channel... i'm done, i unsubscribe there is no longer any of the After Hours crew that i know and love. i'll just enjoy flipping through reruns of my fav shows.
