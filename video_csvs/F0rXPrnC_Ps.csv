"Robert Uy You don't seem to understand what homosexuality *is.* A homosexual cannot be in an opposite sex relationship without living a lie. I'm going to assume you're religious, so I'll say this as well. Lying is one of the ten mortal sins. Homosexuality isn't. I'm going go out on a limb and say it's a more egregious sin to live your entire life in a lie than to live happily in a homosexual relationship. Either way, homosexuals are damned if they do, damned if they don't. The authors of the books in the Bible weren't exactly harbingers of equality. 

Also, don't bring up the nature argument when arguing against homosexuality. You have no scientific or biological basis there. Homosexual behavior is observable in thousands of animals ergo it is completely natural.

Lastly, Elio and Oliver weren't homosexuals. They were bisexuals. They could have ended up with either gender, but the conservatism of the time pushed Oliver to make a choice. The movie could have ended very differently if it had taken place even 10 years later.",-0.781,200
"Sally Vee I never said homosexuality was a sin. As a homosexual myself, I perfectly know I didn't choose to be one and had nothing to do with it and if I had the chance to choose, I'd want to be a straight guy. But my point is having a crush on or falling in love with the same sex is one thing but having sexual act especially sodomy is a different story. If you could please read the article I supplied above, you'd understand where I'm coming from.",0.7469,96
"Sally, you're wasting your time. I decided not to when I read  Robert's suggestion of a reading whose tittle is enough for me. As if there'd be any doubt about the possibility of gays going to Heaven. Of course if one believes in a Heaven whose doors keys are held by religious men (never women, that would be unthinkable...LOL) then one is condemned to live in miserable sin as you point out.  As for Robert's theory of the ilogical anatomical matching of two men vs the logical anatomical matching of man/woman as in a jig saw puzzle.... it shows such ignorance of the man's anatomy... But if there is a Heaven you certainly are on the right track for it for trying to save this poor soul.  :)",-0.3664,143

It's not to say we can't have a crush on or special feelings for someone, but there are really things not meant for us and consummating a homosexual romance is one of them.

Once a man try another man, that’s it. That’s the end of their manhood, once they tried the candy, they don’t want it let it go, as simple as that and there’s no such as thing as bisexuals, that’s a name given to hide the transition of becoming homosexuals. And about this movie, this is clearly a case of pedophilia, how can you support this, this is a movie fantasy for all the pedophiles out there.
When all of this gay manipulation from the homosexuals producers from Hollywood is going to end? men kissing men and having sex in series in shows in movies, I’m so appalled that nobody is doing anything against all of this manipulation of society to get to make men gay and destroy the family?
This movie is another attempt to put in people’s mind that straight men sleeping with another men is ok and are not gay??  Of course they are GAY! In Hollywood now most actors are gay, having a double life, pretending to be something they are not. Enough it’s enough!",0.5489,330

bcnmanhattan50 I beg to disagree but I'm not a poor soul but one that fears Someone who created both of us and all the gay people in the world. I don't want to push my beliefs on any person as I acknowledge the right to freedom of expression. But I realized I'm on a level most gay people nowadays can't understand for now. I just genuinely wish you a continuous happy life and I can still be a friend.,0.967,84
"bcnmanhattan50 I don't mean to offend you by how I put to words my beliefs. And I totally understand the norms of today's homosexuality that it's far from how it was closeted before when it was not as accepted as it is now. But if in case you would like to know how I've perceived things this way, you can perhaps spend a little of your time to check out this article  https://esoriano.wordpress.com/2007/06/02/can-a-homosexual-make-it-to-heaven/amp/. I really hope we can be friends. Thank you for our little correspondence here and have a nice day.",0.9212,99
"bcnmanhattan50 It's certainly just my opinion but based on truth. I respect your perspective and nobody can take your decision making away from you as we were given freedom of choice. But as I said mine is an opinion based on reality, science, conscience etc. Anatomically speaking, the union of the man and the woman fits perfectly together like a jig saw puzzle and the only natural means for human reproduction. It's never a man and another man. The essence is we, being humans as well, get attracted and fall in love too but it doesn't mean we need to put it into action. Consider the nuns of the Catholic Church, it's safe to say most of them are women and if there are lesbians, there's perhaps only few. They can at their will, leave their being nuns, fall in love with a man they love, get married and have sex. But they choose to stay single and they are proofs humans can practice self control, how much more gay people like us. Whatever decisions you make is your call but I really hope you keep an open mind and eventually realize my side of the story.",0.9966,219
