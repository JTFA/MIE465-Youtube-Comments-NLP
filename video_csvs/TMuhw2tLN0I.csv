"She totally glossed over ""Bless your heart"".  It means a lot more than what she said.  Most of the time I hear people say it they are referring to someone who is pathetic in some way.  That may be a little harsher than I meant it to be.  If someone is trying really hard at something and can't seem to get it done someone, generally a woman, may say awww.. bless his heart he is trying so hard.  If your having a really bad day and you have been run ragged someone may say bless your heart you look tired.  Something like that.  It can easily be very condescending.  Many people don't use it like that and really do mean it in a, you seem like your having a hard time and I can sympathize, kind of way.  The point is there is a lot more to that phrase than she is letting on.",0.0476,171
