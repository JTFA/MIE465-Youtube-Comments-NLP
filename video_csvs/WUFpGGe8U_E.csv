@brantleygilbertVEVO this guy is one tough sob. I’m 16 years old and have been following you forever. You’ve served as a role model to me in multiple ways and hearing about your story and how you battled through rehab has gave myself so much confidence to do great things knowing what you did and the path you were on. Thanks for always being that guy to lean on even tho we’ve never met🤙🏼,0.7832,84

hey matt ..this song SO describes my life...first off have faith you will find your way to leave your mark on the world.... it's up to you what Mark you leave... 20 years ago I was one of the worst people in my County... in and out of jail in and out of prison... thought I was Mister All American Badass... then I woke up one day with a plea offer from a lawyer of 20 years in prison... thankfully praise God I ended up not having to do that sentence..even though I deserved every day of it.. and still left me being somebody that nobody trusted and nobody want to be around.. it's taken 20 long years to become the man I am today... with the family and my own successful business.. every time somebody brings up my past I think of this song and a few others by Brantley and Jason Aldean and even Kip Moore.. and I remind myself where I came from compared to who and where I am today don't ever think that you can't make a mark on this world and if it leaves  tattoos on you make sure you leave your own on it... if people need you make sure they got you.. if people doubt you prove them wrong.. Brantley is coming to TAGS  in Big Flats New York this June you can guarantee I will be there with my family and my crew.. I just wish I'll be able to meet him in person there and thank him for the inspiration his songs give me to keep on going,0.9741,288
