You ‚Äúworship‚Äù it and sacrifice every bit of yourself just to stay alive. Only to become an immortalized lost soul, praying in ‚Äúthe dark room‚Äù for eternity. He refused to kneel and instead of running away, he had to fight the ‚Äúbig bad wolf‚Äù. He finally freed himself from the darkness and stepped into the light.

"The crazy thing is how real this shit actually is all over the world! Especially in America in rural areas like Utah, Idaho and pretty much anywhere where there is dense wilderness! It‚Äôs a epidemic it really is, people are going missing all the time in the wild, sometimes within National Parks and sometimes on public land. But this kind of stuff happens all the time. You think satanic worshiping only includes the sacrifice of animals? I can tell you right now that it is not! People are killed in satanic ritual sacrifices all the time in some of the most vile disgusting ways you can imagine! Sometimes they are tortured with their skin peeled off and then bleed out slowly. The heart and blood is usually consumed because it gives them more control and pleases their god! But the best thing they can do is sacrifice innocence and we all know what that is and that I won‚Äôt talk about. But I‚Äôm telling you right now this is real and it‚Äôs something that is actually kept from the public at all costs. And I know because I have two family members one cousin that works for Utah Fish and Game and my grandfather that worked for the national park service in Idaho and Montana for over 37 years. Both of them have multiple stories of them coming across the aftermath of rituals. It‚Äôs funny my cousin has only been working in that field for 4 years and has already come across 5 of these ritual crime scenes! My grandfather that had over 37 years experience couldn‚Äôt even say how many times he‚Äôs found a ritual crime scene and he was scarred for life after finding new born babies up to 1 years of age slaughtered for the devil and consumed by these evil inhuman animals! Hearts would be missing ligaments and other things! He said 99% of the time nobody would ever be brought to justice or the investigation would go nowhere and just end basically the next day! But all this stuff is true and is really covered up! Mormons are actually part of these cults. Behind closed doors in the church not just anyone but the ones that hold some type of stance in the church or others in the church that are vouched for by other high ranking members. Not everyone knows but it‚Äôs very secretive and done right under the noses of the church! I don‚Äôt think that is surprising news to anyone but actually makes a lot of sense!",-0.6958,469
