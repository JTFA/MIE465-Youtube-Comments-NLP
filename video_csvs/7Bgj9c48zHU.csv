"Sometimes I can't decide what shade I should be either. But I have the opposite problem. I'm a glow-in-the-dark half Asian, and no one has my shade of albino. Everything's a peachy pink and, as my Mexican friend said back in 5th grade, I'm too yellow. On the up side, I guess I can do all those Eskinol commercials. 

By the way, I prevent that spider-leg lash by using a 2nd spoolie or old mascara wand, and comb through while it's still fresh. No idea if others do that, but that's my thing.  I now need to look up Tarte and ogle while I check out your other vids.",-0.0644,124
