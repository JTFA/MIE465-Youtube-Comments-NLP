It's just a spectacle though, isn't it.

None of them hold any real power, an it amazes me when I go abroad how many people think that the Monarchy rules us, they don't, as we live in a Democracy and the last time I checked the first born child taking power from their mother/father etc, is not democracy, it is in fact a Dictatorship.

I don't have anything against them personally, they have said/done nothing to annoy me, but that doesn't give them a free pass to live a life of privilege, and it is privilege.

An the whole ""tourism"" argument is bullshit too, the only time the Royals bring in tourism is when one of them get's married or pops out a child (so about every 5 years or so), so that's a very percentage (very small) in terms of tourism, I mean film premieres bring in more people and money that the Royal's do.

An if we were that desperate for tourism, we'd join something like an EU, hang on, we just voted to leave it, shows how desperate we are for tourism right *wink wink*.",-0.5927,225

No actually they dont, they have independant countries that are part of the British Commonwealth, a glorified club for countries who used to be UK property.

Or France, who STILL full on owns a bit of South America, a true overseas colony that still exists. Or Russia who just last year decided to annexe Crimea? But no, you'd rather have blinders.
