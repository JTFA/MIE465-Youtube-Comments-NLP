"AMERICAN SLAVERY CHANGED THE ENTIRE WORLD . THE invention of racism the true starting point. cuz they believed thier skin color made them superior than another being from the human species. They refused to open thier eyes and its still prevalent in how most westerners think in relation to someone who's different not just in looks but culture, politics and religion. These ideologies littered minds like seeds and nurtured prejudices here in the modern world. It's blasphemous how their president representing all their flaws yet people continue to fight him. Peace in mind but controlled by their fears. Goes to show how little of a human YOU really are. I can list multiple examples of racism, which is controlled by fear and sense of superiority but I hope you're smart enough to believe the start of this chain will be impossible to reverse.

We were less than human, we don't feel pain etc. Do you understand that was so they could do evil things to us and not feel bad. White people are the natural enemy of people of color. Although the world has moved forward we have to be honest and understand that what is best for them is not what's best for us. They're preserving their people and have never and still do not, truly care for us. Many believe that integration was a huge mistake on our part. For wanting to be equal to them...

Every time when someone makes a comment about the country NOT being racist anymore, it's a completely lie, the United States is racist to the core, simple like that!

I love the U.S. but watching these elements of the history of the country makes me extremely divided if I should really love the nation. As a black Brazilian, I find it very discomforting the way the U.S. treated and still treats its non-white citizenry, it's absolutely scary and bizarre how racism and xenophobia are rampant in the country in plain 21st century, it's a racial and religious fundamentalism that is hard to watch, let alone experience it, and that makes the USA one of the most dangerous countries in the world for blacks and other non-white people.",-0.9644,214

"Jeffery Mizell Thanks. It's something that I have been thinking about for a good number of years. Although I'm Brazilian, but I've been always fascinated by black American music (Smooth Jazz and R&B are my favorites genres), I consider the United States my second country and to see the country that I always loved, treating blacks like this is simply horrendous. Racism exists in every part of the planet, but the way it has developed in the U.S. is downright terrifying; I only imagine how was to be black in the country before the 1960s, unsettling and terrorizing to say the least, you couldn't use the facilities of your own damn country, a complete absurd. Just like slavery, the American racism segregation was a crime against humanity, I could never imagine such a thing being installed here in Brazil (which is far from being a racial democracy, but it's still much less prejudiced than the States). Correct me if I'm wrong, after all, I never set foot in the nation, but it seems that the USA just simply hates blacks. Black American history is one continuous history of suffering and bigotry. I've always felt that the U.S. doesn't like to give credit for blacks about anything.

They said they don't like giving pain medicine because it causes addiction.  They finally gave her some pain medicine because her blood pressure was rising real fast because of the pain. She also was experiencing extreme diarrhea, so she could not keep any food down, it would go right through her, including water. She needed assistance to go to the restroom, because she was too weak to go by herself. They were giving her Imodium for the diarrhea, but it wasn't helping. The patient next to her kept saying that she was in a lot of pain, she was white, and at first they refused. She would scream and keep pressing the button for help. They gave her some but it wasn't helping. She asked for the doctor and he gave her some stronger medicine. When my cousin got home she kept pooping all over herself and was vomiting.

"The problem is with the human race, not ""the whites"" or ""the blacks"" or browns, yellows or whatever other ultimately irrelevant label we want to put on ourselves. In the U.S. we've defined it as a ""black/white"" issue because those are the familiar parameters that have existed (among others) in this particular country, during our particular recent (200 + year) national history. Don't think there wasn't inhumanity and brutality between Native American tribes before Europeans ever set foot on this soil. Don't think that Hutus wouldn't have done similarly to Tutsis in Rwanda. Don't think that there hasn't been slaughter and inhumanity between the Japanese and the Chinese or Serbians and Croatians. Human history is replete with man's inhumanity against fellow human beings. On some level everyone has been or will be both a victim and a perpetrator of some form of evil. Yes, we need to identify what and where we've gone wrong, like this video describes, and then we need to develop a strategy that builds understanding and unifies, not demonizes or divides. Yes everybody needs to be understood, not to excuse evil, but because the same evil that overcomes one person and causes them to degrade their neighbor, is the same evil that can overcome you. You need to understand how it happened (within the individual soul) and what you can do to fortify yourself against it. The most dangerous thing you can do is assume that you would ""never do such a thing"". To make that assumption is to misunderstand the nature of evil. Otherwise we will overlook the real issue (man's loss of connection to his spiritual source) and perpetuate the inhumanity, simply in another form and under different parameters. I believe salvation is within man's reconciliation with his source, God. If that isn't the solution, there isn't any. Everything else is just BS to make us feel better. IMO. If we fail to see that we are all participants in a historical spiritual war, from the beginning of human history to the present, then we will continue to abuse and destroy ourselves and each other. It's never going to be eradicated. The best we can do is to create environments that discourage and don't encourage evil. The most important environment to police evil from and set up a government built on love is within ourselves, so I believe.",-0.9964,452

I will say this, slavery was 100% wrong and all freed slaves should have been returned to Africa with emancipation. In fact blacks today should be allowed to return at taxpayer‚Äôs expense in return for giving up the U.S. citizenship. You could also pay each person leaving a one time fee of $50,000 cash from the tax money and be light years ahead. It cost over $100.000 a year to incarcerate one convicted person. Over 80% of black men will be incarcerated at one time in their life. Cut cost, pay them to leave and don‚Äôt allow them back. Hispanics want to come here and work, Asians come here broke and in 5 years own their own business ,give them the black‚Äôs citizenship.
