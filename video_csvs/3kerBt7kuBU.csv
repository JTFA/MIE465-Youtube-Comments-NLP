"""Lighting someone else's flame does not dim yours""

This is one of the most inspirational things I have heard in awhile. For me, I have always been interested in posting youtube videos but I always felt there were already so many talented people in the industry that I didn't have anything to offer. I have always looked back on your videos for awhile but only recently subscribed, and it might be the New Year, but I feel more motivated than ever to try posting videos. My new year's resolution is to post at least one video a month, nothing too crazy I know but a big step for me, and I am taking that first baby step because of you! I want to say thank you so much for being such a real person, your honesty and 'Raw Beauty' is something that really draws me to you. So thank you for being you! I'm glad there are people like you in the industry and you've definitely lit a flame in me. I don't know if you will read this but I am posting my first video of the new year (I've been debating for a long time whether or not to edit/post so this video dates all the way back to black friday) and that's all because of you. Thank you so much, Kristi!",0.9937,248

"Also I think the Erin Condren planner can be overwhelming.

There are more things I want but I don't have the time.",0.3826,120
Everything you said in the end is exactly what I needed. I've been wanting to make a channel and start making beauty videos for a while but always thought I needed the right lighting and a good camera so I got the lighting and finally decided to film a video today but after watching the footage I got really down and felt discouraged and was thinking about not posting it because I felt it isn't professional enough and like I acted stupid and that I looked terrible but after watching this video I think I'm just gonna do it cuz I want to and it'll make me happy.

"Here's what i think happened with your channel: I think that people were looking for a genuine review about the Jaclyn palette, and they were clicking on smaller youtubers because they are more genuine than those bigger youtubers.

Hey Kristi! I loved everything about this video. I found you this year through either your Jaclyn Hill palette review or your Subculture review - I don‚Äôt remember which one. I felt immediately connected to you though because you felt so real and genuine in your videos. I even filmed a video of the Top 5 YouTubers I Trust and you were one of them! This year I felt a little discouraged on my channel because I haven‚Äôt seen a ton of growth and what you said in this video was really encouraging to me. I kind of felt like I didn‚Äôt have a place here because other people were making connections and friendships and I felt like I wasn‚Äôt.

"I agreed with so much that you said in this video. I have definately found that not talking about resolutions or goals does work out better than announcing them!
Also I started my youtube channel because youtube brought me out of a dark place in my life and I think maybe it would do the same for someone else. My partner had depression and thought it would be best to split up which caused me to go through depression myself. I quit my job bcoz i hated it but also i just wanted to be in bed all the time. After a few months i decided i had to snap out of it. I decided i needed to focus on bettering myself. I decided i wanted to learn how to do my makeup nicely and find products that worked for me but i hated getting help from the cosmetic counter ladies because i was scared to just buy whatever they said. I started watching youtube. Not only did i learn how to do my makeup and find products that worked for me but also when people talked about real shit like you did here it made me feel better. In real life i am a beauty advisor now which i love but youtube i just feel like i have this connection with it and i want to explore that. I never had a hobby or a passion before youtube. I hope to make my channel better this year and i want to try to make more time for it. But its been hard as im also trying to lose weight and I'm planning my wedding with my fiance (the same guy) üôå

In my 30s, I realized that I spent way too much time worried about other people and how they felt about me and what they wanted for me, and that I wasted so much time chasing things that just weren't worth it. I finally stopped caring, I finally starting putting my energy into myself and the people in my life who've shown to me that they want to be there. I have a great career, house, my physical and mental health has improved, and I've continued to make those things my priority. 

Also I bought a planner this year and...yeah, we'll see. lol. I'm super organized, but I wanted so have somewhere to write everything down. As far as not having kids...do you, babe. My best friend also has PCOS and isn't going to have kids (ever). She gets shit, but I don't know why it's anyone else's business on what she does.
