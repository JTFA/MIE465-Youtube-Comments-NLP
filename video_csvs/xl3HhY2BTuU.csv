"A very rare drop kick

This website have Wide Receiver Football Gloves, among them also best Nike Football gloves, which are large variety of Football Receiver gloves youth, and adult players, also a disposable variety of NFL Receiver gloves, and other brands, like Under Armour, Cutters, Adidas etc. So in conclusion this entire quality gloves football receiver is so good in helping improving the receiver‚Äôs player performance so they can achieve the goals to a high standard.

Is this drop kick very rare or is just fantasy of a few people? 
In the history of American football has appeared a technical term named ‚Äûthe drop kick.‚Äù Now, how the drop kick is attempted? You see, it can only be attempted when the ball hits the ground and is then kicked through the goalposts. The drop kick are very rare, only one drop kick has been performed in NFL football since 1941, when Doug Flutie dropkicked an extra point following a touchdown in the fourth quarter, and that was the first drop kick converted in the NFL. As the touchdowns kick are by far the option most preferred and has a success rate well over 90% in the NFL at least. The New England Patriots team are the only who utilize very rarely seen tactic of drop kick in over 60 years. Pats special-teamer Nate Ebner dropped kicked the ball, in an attempt to catch the visiting Philadelphia Eagles against the Miami Dolphins in 6 December 2005. Since then you can search and see a few more drop kicks on videos at the internet.
About this, what I recommend you also, that is very useful to have a good qualities football gloves that can improve your skills and it can help you allot, like:  Wide Receiver Football Gloves, or Nike Football gloves, or Football Receiver gloves youth, or but not finally, NFL Receiver gloves.
So as we have seen, yes the drop kick is very rare in American football games!",0.899,370
