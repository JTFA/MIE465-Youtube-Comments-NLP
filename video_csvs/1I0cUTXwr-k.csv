"I feel like I should preface this by saying that I am indeed a 49ers fan, and I personally have nothing against Kaepernick's protests, but this video is not too accurate in assessing Kaep, stats do not tell the whole story. Kaep was mediocre at best and his stats are inflated due to his performance during garbage time in blowout games when it did not matter what happened. The defense was bad yes but it is important to understand that Kaep kept them on the field, every game the defense started strong and forced numerous three and outs before halftime. Kaep would take the field, move the ball 8 yards and sit back down, this is how games got away from him and he managed to boost his stats late in the 4th. Also there is the point that he was not a team player, never took over a leadership role, was not liked at all in the locker room and refused to put in the extra work during practice which resulted in poor play come game day. Even if we put stats and characteristics aside there is the bigger picture why he is unemployed, he is a media circus. The same reason he isn't on the team is the same reason Tebow had to leave football, a mediocre QB at best and a career backup with most teams, and if you are gonna be a backup, head coaches don't want to answer a million questions about their back up QB it is a distraction to the team and from practice. It just isn't worth it to put up with someone like kaep right now since he is realistically an average QB and everyone from the locker room and front office will do nothing but saying kaepernick's name over and over which isn't what you want from someone who isn't the face of the franchise. He is just the next person to be added to the growing list of players the media has killed, along side Michael Sam, and Tim Tebow",0.7621,363

He has been trending down ..... HARD and if he had one crap season thats one thing but hes had several declining CONSISTENTLY in a row with a slight slight upturn. This means hes high risk but hey if you can get him on the cheap maybeeee but also hes not. Hes been the to the super bowl he has those heavy average figures to show off with which leads on to why hes really expensive.

"Kaepernick has what are called garbage time stats, where his team gets blown out and the opposing team is playing a softer defense.  Also, Chip Kelly's offenses are famous for producing QBs that put up lots of numbers to go along with quick 3 and outs and turnovers.  Chip Kelly was run out of the NFL not because his numbers were bad, as his offenses were on the better end of the league, it's because his style of coaching wasn't compatible with the NFL where defenses are used to longer drives to plan against the opposing offense.

Kaepernick is not a bad quarterback even considering this.  He could start for a few teams and improve their production even slightly.  The problem is that the baggage he carries isn't worth a mediocre veteran quarterback for what he's asking to be paid. Kaepernick left the 49ers.  He was not forced out or released.  He left voluntarily and voided his own contract like a dumbass thinking he was gonna field better offers. 

The baggage isn't entirely his fault though.  The fact is that the media keeps reporting this as a social justice issue and puts the spotlight on him.  Teams get very nervous with media attention.  Nobody wants to be the target of the media, either for picking him up, or even more disastrous if he can't make the roster and they release him.  If the media would have shut up in the offseason and let teams talk to him without the speculation going around, he would have been on a team months ago.

The same thing happened to Michael Sam.  I don't think anyone had a problem with Michael Sam coming out, but the fact that he made a public move to do so immediately hurt him.

"Kap should have a spot in the league... but its important to point out that particularly with his last season, many of the stats he was putting up were well after the 49ers were completely out of the game they were in, down by upwards of 17 near the beginning of the 2nd quarter quite often.  His high completion percentages or games with lots of yards were often a result of him playing against defenses rotating in 2nd and 3rd stringers.  Yes, the 49ers defense and offense were crap for him, but just watch the guy play, let alone for five years.   You'll see a player with incredible athleticism but quite often total obliviousness for things such as pressure, or THE PLAY CLOCK.  Want to see him play again, he could be fit into a system with a particular role or maybe even the right coaching, but his rise as a quarterback ended on fourth and goal in the Superdome.",0.946,174
"Keeping this ""G"" rated and civil has really helped your argument in my eyes. I'll be up front I don't agree with Kaep politically. If I talked to the guy I don't think I'd want to fight him or anything, but I know we would disagree on a bunch of things.

That said this makes since he has better numbers than a bunch of QBs in the league and it's clear to see the owners are black balling him. Does he deserve a shot? Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt. Do I want him of my favorite NFL team? No, the media lightning rod is not something they need.

I do want Kaep to come back. I want to see what he's got so we can see what kind of numbers he puts up going forward.

To draw back to my original statement about keeping it ""G"" rated, when someone gets too emotional with their argument it personally pushes me away, regardless of political leaning. Containing your emotions and showing a concise numbers based argument helped to elevate my opinion that Kaep isn't a bad QB and isn't being kept out of the league because he's a bad QB, but instead he is being blackballed by the owners.

Hes a lifetime starting record is 28-30. Yea he may have a good QBR but he just hasn't been able to win games. Lets see the Chargers that year Let up 423 points the next closest to the 9ers besides Cleveland. The Chargers put up 409 points only 19 more than the 9ers. Put this in perspective, Rivers QBR was 86.7 and he went 5-11, Kaep 90.7 went 1-11, Gabbert 1-4 as a Starter All in 2016.

As a Lions fan, I could see this being (more) valid for a traditional pocket passer like Stafford, or a Peyton Manning - they over stay in the pocket trying to make a play rather than ditching the ball and take a needless sack.

But with Kaepernick... I mean, he could pass the ball but he also had good mobility and wasn't afraid to take off if the opportunity presented itself. Based just on that, I'd think that, while Kaepernick probably is responsible for at least some of his sacks, to place sole responsibility on him for all of them seems a bit ridiculous, and I see no mention that they adjusted for those type of plays in the link.

He had a really bad O-line. Put any QB behind that line and they will struggle too. That's my thought.",-0.1128,172

It's always been ""he's not good enough to overcome his high asking price (especially for his downslide years between 2012 and 2015), and for the waves he'll create for the team.""  The reason a lot of other quarterbacks were given a chance before Colin Kaepernick is because they were already on the team, or cheap enough for the team to take a risk.  It's all about risk analysis.  There are only three conditions to consider.  I'll label each one with a capital letter, while the lower case will be the exact opposite.

(A) Kaepernick performs well enough
(B) Media attention is an impediment
(C) Salary cap is fine

This means we have eight possible outcomes:  ABC, aBC, AbC, abC, ABc, aBc, Abc, abc.  In seven out of eight of those outcomes, there is some negative side-effect of hiring Kaepernick.  Obviously, not every outcome is equally likely (ie: Kaepernick will likely do well enough on most teams), but then again, not each condition is equally valued among teams either.  A team not concerned with media attention might be strapped for cash, so hiring Kaepernick will result in cutting a huge chunk of a trained team.  A team with a lot of money might already have a reasonable option, so ""well enough"" might be Brady levels of performance.   And a team not interested in a strong performance is...the Browns.

"Numbers aren't everything. While he was with the 'niners he actually played with a very very good defense for a few seasons. During those seasons he also had a great running back and multiple good receivers. 

I'm a Seahawks fan, meaning I actually followed the 'niners fairly closely since they were the hawks biggest rivals for a few years and I can say with certainty that Kaep was their weak point. When they won with him it was because their defense held and Frank Gore ran the other team into the ground. When he made good passes it was Vernon Davis, Michael Crabtree, or Anquon Boldin either being wide open or making a good catch. On the other hand, when they lost it was mostly his fault. The games I remember best were obviously when he played the Seahawks.

Early in his career the home team won every meeting. In San Francisco the 'niners (other than Kaep) usually outplayed the hawks who made the games close (very close) by picking off Kaep, sometimes a lot. When the teams were here in Seattle they went similar although this time in favor of the hawks because, ya' know, they were at home. The games were more or less even outside of Kaep, and most games where won by points off of turnovers where the hawks dominated by picking off Kaep a lot (as well as keeping his running in check and the DBs having better coverage on his great receivers which greatly limited his overall production). Later in his career things took a turn for the worse. 

His team started to crumble around him which simply meant he was exposed more and more. There were fewer players around him to win games for him. As far as his match ups with the Seahawks, the team began losing at home.

They started off being close, but progressed toward embarrassing for the 'niners and their games in Seattle (as you might expect) were worse. They're defense was letting in more and more points and the offense was generating less and less. What really stood out to me was that he was plagued by interceptions. In one of their games, Richard Sherman had more interception return yards than all of Kaepernick's receivers had receiving yards combined. This is obviously an extreme example, but my point was to show that while Kaepernick's numbers might be there, he is an entirely inconsequential quarterback. 

When the team is good, he wins and plays about as well as the team. When the team is bad, he plays equally bad and proves that he is only as good as the team around him. He ends up losing lots of games this way. This isn't to say that quarterbacks should be judged based on their win percentage, or that we shouldn't take into account how the team impacts the player, because it's pretty much only Drew Brees who can play at such an elite level with such bad teams around him, but good quarterbacks can usually do something even with bad team, and Kaep simply can't. 

TLDR: Good quarterback make an impact on the games they play in and the teams they play for. The games he plays in and the teams he plays for impact Colin Kaepernick.",0.9893,607

"Some good arguments. I still am not a believer in Kaep as a starter in the NFL any longer. His yearly regression in passer rating until the one season in Chip's offense was good evidence of this. He has regressed as a passer since his first 16 games as a starter. Factoring in his interception ratio is like saying Tyrod Taylor is an above average QB in the NFL, which has proven to be incorrect. Sure, Peterman wasn't the answer, but Taylor has his struggles. Just because a QB is adverse to throwing interceptions or into tight windows doesn't necessarily mean they are good.

Kaep could definitely start for a number of teams though. And with the right coaching he could do alright, but I don't think we will ever see what we see early in his career again. At least he isn't prone to injury like RG3 with his running ability. I think the regression as a passer combined with his political activism is what is turning teams off right now. And Kaep also appears to have closed himself off as well. Don't think he is interested in playing in the NFL any longer.",0.9732,212
"Some of the comments are somewhat missing the point by making excuses as to why Team X wouldn't take Kap.

Of course each team has individual concerns, but some of the QBs who have not only played, but earned roster spots were worse than Kap no matter what metrics or emotions (beyond PATRIOTISM)are used. You could perhaps make an excuse for one team, were they the only team with a roster opening in the entire league. At that point, you could analyze the individual fit, but for Kap to not be a fit with any team in the entire NFL, while players who have been demonstrably bad for their entire careers get jobs, is a clear signal that it has nothing to do with playing style or even playing competence.

The fact is, without the anthem protest, there are only a handful of teams in the NFL who wouldn't consider Kap a better option as a backup or third string QB than the likes of Cody Kessler, Kevin Hogan, Connor Shaw, Geno Smith, Sean Mannion, Tom Savage... you can go on and on.

People point to Case Keenum and say 'that worked out pretty well' - it did, and that's the point. Your chances of things working out 'pretty well' improve with the quality of the player. You can take a QB who has never done anything and the chances of getting Keenum-style results are low.

Realistically, any quarterback who makes it to the NFL is a ""good"" quarterback. If you give them perfect protection, hell, *I* could be a decent quarterback.

"You're not counting for highly inflated stats in garbage time, which he's had a lot of blowout losses the last 2 seasons of play. Guys like Kevin Kolb and David Garrard played in competitive games for competitive teams. Their stats reflect their play (unlike Kyle Orton who during his season with the Bills is filled with garbage time, in blowout victories and defeat). Fact is, he only won 1 game as a starter his last season and had trouble competing with Blaine Gabbert. He has a lower than average completion rate and has documented issues with accuracy. Stats are just numbers. Is he terrible? No. But he's not better than 80% of starting QB, and the bottom 20% are backup QBs and underpaid players.

Your assumption is: If X players get paid a lot and are performing worse, then Y player deserves the same (which is an illogical argument). Guys like Eli Manning have well documented extenuating circumstances with their numbers (non-existent line for instance), while the others on that list are rookies or backup QBs paid very low salaries (for the NFL at least).

Sure, there's the Daltons and Newtons that have ludicrous contracts that do not match their productivity, but that doesn't mean teams unfamiliar with Kaepernick automatically owe him similarly large contracts. Besides the Bears (*cough*Glennon*cough*), few organizations are stupid enough to pay large sums to unproven QBs in their team's system without trying them out or having a proven track record with multiple teams (not even the Browns). Why should say the Bills pay large sums to Kap when they already have a very comparable QB (and possibly superior) they are unsatisfied with? 


My question is: Is Kaepernick willing to play for league minimums and fight for a job, or does he want millions to play? Would he be willing to go for a Tyrod Taylor type contract, where he'd have to prove his worth or play for league minimums? Because I see a guy who made a ton of cash in the NFL and isn't willing to put his career and body on the line for a team like the Browns at minimum salary (or worse CFL pay).

I'm 100% sure he can land a job...but he'd have to take a huge pay cut and ditch the media circus...because he's nowhere near good enough to be paid a large sum of cash.",-0.7406,457
"Your stats are misleading, first where are you getting a 90% passer rating? His rating is 88.9% per nfl.com. And in 2015, Kaepernick had a defense-adjusted yards above replacement of minus-182, 35th in the NFL. By all metrics, he was one of the worst quarterbacks in the league. If you watched any games in 2015 and 2016 you would know Kap had a hard time hitting anything  beyond 10 yards. Kaepernick was  benched by the 49ers after throwing for 4 yards in three quarters against the Bears in 2016. He lost the locker room before that against the Packers in week 4 and eventually declined his 1 year option to stay employed.",-0.8591,127
"You’re right, but this issue was never about performance exclusively. He isn’t signed because owners are afraid his political stances and actions would hurt the image of their franchise. Just like in all other businesses, no one is required to hire you if they believe you would damage their brand’s likability.",-0.8573,62
average quarterback with a ton of baggage. it needs to level out like adrian peterson you think he would have survived the child abuse case if he wasn't a god. Look at other players like say Burficit or suh that are dirty as hell but play their position quite well.,0.4736,53

"have you ever heard of the frase, One Hit Wonder? that was him. he had a one good season, and thats it. why aren't you talking about Nick Foles? he was a backupuntil Wentz got injured. please check the last 2 seasons he spent with the 49ers. he is not good enough to be a starter, but too expensive to be a backup. get your facts together, and do a better reserch next time",0.7851,85

ok but it's not healthy for the team to sign kap as all the media attention that follows also those worse QB's are wayyy cheaper even Jacoby Brisset who has similar stats to Kap and he only makes 2.2 million dollars per year while kap made 19 million per year,-0.7534,50
