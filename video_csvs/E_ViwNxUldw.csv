"I once made a Goldfish in a pond for a little girls birthday feast. The water was jelly made of Tropical Fruit flavour vegetarian jelly crystals, which have a pale colour and makes a slightly cloudy jelly, which you can see into and looks quite like pondwater but tastes much more delicious. Waterlilies were made from little pieces of Apple. I used a type of apple that has a red skin & the colour kind of blushes into the sub dermal flesh.  I think I used Lemon Balm leaves or similar for leaves. I carved the Goldfish out of a carrot. It took a little practice. 
   Unfortunately my carving upset the little girl, who despite my assurances that it was made from Carrot was fully convinced that a genuine Goldfish was stuck in jelly.",0.3047,145

"You just made a Virgin, Potato version of Shrimp Chips. The flavor is condensed and once cooked, fully, you have a crisp with twice the flavor punch.  Cook on medium high to high heat until it fully expands. I've been frying & eating them for over 50 years now.
Leave it in the pan until it quits expanding (10-20 seconds) and there are no clear parts left. Drain & season. Munch away. 
When you make your own, you can pre-season them and the flavor is cooked in. Or, add a bit of food color and have colorful chips. The color is lighter, but visible, once fried.
Save the clear chips in a plastic bag, in your cupboard, until desired. Got guests? Fry up a fast (5-8 minutes max) of 1/2 kilo or  1 1/4 lb clear chips, and your guests have fresh made crisps.
I've kept Shrimp Chips for up to one year this way. 
Buy a box of Shrimp Chips, in clear or colorful,  online or at your neighborhood Asian Market. About $2.50 - 3.50 USD.
 Love your experiments.
