"Don't you hate when some shitty amateur editor felt like being artistic and don't even give you the option to see the interesting part of the video happen in real time? Show the full thing in real time and then maybe show in slow motion after for those who want to see it like that. Treat it like a sports action replay, not a fucking Matrix movie.",0.8909,71
