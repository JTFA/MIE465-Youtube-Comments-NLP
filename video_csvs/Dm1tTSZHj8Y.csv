"""slight less efficient but possible"" look at you pc, look at your phone; pretty much all high tech, including renewable energy, use rare earth metals and other rare materials, minerals and so do the batteries. why do you think that is? this is because it's near impossible to find a decent (not good, just decent) substitute for rare these materials. there is no guarantee that we'll find one in the conceivable future either. there is a reason why there is talk among clean energy leaders and battery production sector and to secure rare minerals for the industry; google it.

also, you can't make the wind turbines 100% recyclable. as i said before, the blades themselves cannot be recycled. also, without rare materials, they won't be efficient enough to make economical sense; a similar thing applies to the solar as well. they've been trying to make ones without rare materials, but so far they've failed. don't be hopeful for the future either because many future design are like their predecessors in this regard. going 100% renewable means building a lot new farms, which in turn means a lot of mining (mining for these rare materials are actually even worse (environmentally) than mining for many other materials).

both solar and wind are inherently fickle and unreliable. also, as the weather continues to become more and more erratic due to global climate change, this problem will only get bigger. the former depends on continuous and strong wind, which is not always available, weather is an unpredictable thing by its very nature. also, this means the wind farms will have to be placed in specific locations for maximum possible production, but this locations depend on old data. the climate is is rapidly changing. the weather is getting unpredictable. so, that old data doesn't work as good as it used to anymore and as the rapid erratic shifts continue (and become more frequent) wind itself will become even more unreliable. the latter, on the other hand,  relies on sun light. this means it will fail to produce electricity for latter part of the day, each day and every day. moreover, even during the day there will still be problems. if the sky is not clear, then the amount of energy produced will decrease. if the sky is too cloudy or if there is rain, snow, dust storm..., then it will produce little to no energy. to minimize this, just like as you do with the wind, you might try putting farms on specific locations, but just like the as it was in wind's case, this might not work. as weather becomes more unpredictable, reliability of solar will decrease. on top of all this, solar makes even less sense in higher latitudes as the long winter seasons pretty much make them useless. 

the changing climate and erratic weather pattern effect not just the solar and wind, but pretty much all renewables. what is usually regarded as the most reliable renewable, the hydro, is getting less reliable as we speak. dams all over the world are already reporting and experiencing record lows in their reservoirs. their energy production is already decreasing. also, as huge droughts get more common, cities come to rely heavily in their reservoirs, which means energy production has a lower priority now. erratic weather, less rainfall during crucial growing seasons and more frequent floods/hails... etc. are already wrecking havoc in the agriculture sector. many areas that used to be farmed are being abandoned, suitable land for agriculture is decreasing. due to this bio-fuel/biomass industry is already experiencing problems. just like all other renewables, this will only get worse. people are already beginning to prioritize food and livestock crops over industrial ones.

as i said exporting energy is not always available or economically feasible (assuming everyone is using 100% renewables). especially during bad weather or a bad season. your neighbors might be experiencing energy problems as well. many counties might also avoid importing energy. this can be because of political pressure, political sanctions. they might be experiencing problems or at least expecting problems and might not want import energy as a precaution. or they might set the prices too high, which will be disastrous for your country. storage is not something you can avoid. people will want to store energy when they can because remember; weather is unpredictable, especially now. so, you need to build a lot of storage facilities, which means you need a lot of batteries. however, this, in and of itself, is a terrible thing. modern batteries require rare materials as well. since you'll need to build a lot of them, you'll need a lot of mining. and that's just the raw materials. battery production itself has a negative impact on the environment; increasing global demand will make this go skyrocket. 

nuclear fission on the other hand has proved itself to be the most reliable energy. it is not effected by climate or rain, snow or any other bad weather or weather becoming more erratic. even if we limit ourselves to current generation, it can provide steady and reliable energy and can even be used in load-following mode. also, nuclear energy (both types) don't require much fuel, that's literally its thing. so, unlike renewables and storage, you don't need to worry about the environmental impact due to mining for nuclear fission fuel, and don't even need to think about fusion's impact. filtering water for uranium is currently more than its mining, but this is not hard to improve (again you don't need much). for thorium, you don't even need to mine specifically for it. as i said before, it's a by-product of rare metal mining. most high technology depends on them, so with or without going completely renewable, the mining for it will continue. as a result, regardless of the status of renewables, we'll still be producing thorium without actually meaning to. and we just need these until fusion becomes cheap enough, then we can switch to that.

another thing. most new fission technologies i was talking about, are already here and they work. actually, the molten salt reactors were tested back in 60's. so they are not just prototypes or thing on paper. and we are already building them. with, time they will replace the older reactors. also, remembers, the new generation is both cheaper, and melt-down proof. also, they can be industrialized and can be small enough to be put on ships and planes or in space craft for destined for a moon/mars/... colony, which is why nasa is looking at them. 

you also, talk about big companies bashing renewables. big oil has been doing that to the nuclear long before renewable became a thing. for all those decades they've been fear-mongering and spreading baseless fears and misinformation to the general public. unfortunately, renewable sector joined them in their effort. 

also, you say nuclear is proven to be risky. going outside is proven to be risky, drinking water is proven to be risky. there is always a risk everywhere. what matters is not whether something is risky, but how risky it is. we had fission for more than half a decade. and now we have over 500 of them on the world. do you know what we learned along the way? it is that fission is both extremely reliable and also safe even though it carries a risk. in all that time, we only had two big accident, which themselves are not as catastrophic as people believe. no really, go look it up. look at statistic, look at the research, don't just settle with fear. also, while we are on still on the topic of risk, is going 100% renewables not risky? especially now, when the weather is becoming more and more erratic as the climate change worsens. one thing most expert in the energy field agree (even the renewable experts) is that 100% renewable is an utter nonsense. trying to push something inherently unreliable to be the sole energy production in a world where the energy demand is increasing each and every day and whose weather is getting less and less predictable as time goes on is pure madness. that would be us as civilization shooting ourselves in the foot in the most painful way imaginable. like it or not, nuclear fission is staying here to form the backbone of the new grid and also counteract the finicky nature of renewables.",-0.9921,1621

"Dear physics girl,

I have been interested in electrical energy generation for years now and its my personal belief we need to find a NEW way to generate electrical energy. With this I mean not necessarily the technique ( heat/steam--> kinetic/turbine --> dynamo/electric ) but the source. We have to change the chemical element or we need to be smart enough to find a new way to skip one of these steps in the technique if we really want to be efficient. Did you know the efficiency of most power plants is just around 40% ? I am amazed how we still lose 60% of our input energy as heat. Yet doing something about it isn't that simple either. We need to think about economy as well. I have faith in solar panels though, wind energy is maybe a secondary thing but the big game changer should be either solar energy, a new type of interaction from which we derive energy from ( anti-matter/matter annihilations hello?)

"I liked the video and it managed to achieve its goal of informing about energy generation and how much energy we humans use, but I'm a bit dissapointed in it. (ONLY A BIT JUST HEAR ME OUT AND DON'T FREAK OUT)

I liked the idea of using the shakeweight to illustrate how electrical energy is mostly produced and how much work you'd have to put to power a house, but it seems that it ONLY tried to illustrate the point. What I mean is that it didn't look like most of the effort and work that you put into shaking the shakeweight went into electricity in the coil, ie. it wasn't very well tuned for it. I know that would add a lot of more difficulty to the project but in the end, the numbers you gave at the end would have been a bit more accurate. In my opinion it should have been a shakeweight-like device that produces all of the resistance that you need to work out from the magnet moving through the coil. But there is a thing that does that: an exercise bike! A lot of them rely on magnets and copper to produce the resistance to turn that you need to work out, so using one  could also have been a lead to some more interesting trivia. I don't know if shakeweights also function this way, but if they do, it's a shame that you couldn't use that instead of the tiny coil.

All these stages cause some form of pollution if not damage to landscape.

 Wind turbines, heat collectors and solar cells can even be made from recycled metals and decommissioning is  almost as easy as scrapping a car or plane. 

Maintenance is also simpler and the average car mechanic can be trained to do most.

While there have been incidents with wind turbines and even lives lost in a fire (once?) the resulting cost of those incidents has been minimal compared to the nuclear incidents in history.

When all south facing roofs are covered with either heat collectors and solar cells then there will not be a need for a centralized power plant for domestic use and the cost will have come down to a level much cheaper then nuclear (if that isn't already the case)

nuclear being only good at providing a constant output is only true for very old reactors, modern reactors (that are already in operation) have a degree of maneuverability in their output. they can be used in load-following mode. this is not some vague technical possibility, countries around the world are already using their reactors in this way; just look at France if you want a good example. newer generations of reactors actually have even higher maneuverability than the current generation reactors do, and they are much more responsive. they can be quickly adjusted to meet the varying rate of demand in the grid, which eliminates the need to export energy from outside or store it in some form for later usage. so, what you said is a myth, though an expected one. countries like usa generally use their reactors in the traditional sense even today. this is because they use coal power plants to make up for the fluctuations  in demand.

i might be wrong, but i feel like i'm being misunderstood. in any case, i want to clarify a few things. i'm not against traditional renewable energy. i'm not saying we should ignore them; what i'm saying is that nuclear energy (fission for now and fusion for later) and renewables are two sides of the same coin which is clean/green energy.",0.8763,252
"cmulder002
""its not economical once you factor the decommission and spend fuel storage cost."" >>> if we you are talking about the old reactors, then you are right. however, the newer designs are far cheaper than the old ones and practically meltdown-proof.

also, if you add the the cost of storage for renewables to the mixture, they quickly become uneconomical. 100% clean is not feasable without nuclear.",0.4019,82
"cmulder002 

by your logic, then there is no such thing as clean energy. Renewables themselves require mining for their raw materials, and many of the higher efficiency designs require rarer elements, even some rare earth metals. this will be blown out of proportion if you are aiming the world to become 100% renewable as that would require a lot, i mean A LOT of new farms to be build. recycle all you want, you'll still need new materials, which need to be mined and processed. and this is only one part of the problem. another part is storage. exporting energy is not always possible or feasible. regardless, you'll need a way to store your excess energy. like it or not, batteries are still the best option (in terms of efficiency, many of the proposed alternatives aren't really that efficient) to do this, and this isn't likely to change for a long time. you'll need to build batteries in a mind blowing global scale. this is a nightmare, because this industry is already infamous for its negative impact on the environment and the extremely harmful pollutants it usually creates. going 100% renewable means that the already big negative impacts of this industry on the environments will be scaled up to insane levels. also, just like the renewables themselves, they, too, will require a lot of mining and processing. also, since many renewable designs do have rarer elements. so, they require an even more harmful type of mining and processing. this goes for both wind (gallium and indium) and wind (neodymium and dysprosium). you cannot create efficient panels or turbines without this materials, there have been many tries, but they all failed. 

also, i don't know if you know this, but the recycling industry isn't really clean either; it does produce a lot of pollution just like any other industry, in some cases the pollution is so high that people question their usefulness. also, recycling isn't as easy or efficient as you seem to think (""almost as easy as scrapping a car or plane""). this is especially true when it comes renewables, the industry for it is still too small. even if you scale it up, you'll still be unable to recycle everything, many parts can be recycled, but many other parts can't. one of the best examples would be the blades of the wind turbines. they are made of glass and carbon fibers which are notorious for how hard it is to recycle them. also, since the recycling industry for solar is really young, we are still not really sure about how efficient it will be at recycling solar panels. we are not really good at recycling them at this points and there, and there is not guarantee we will recent a decent capacity any time soon. putting them into landfills is not an option, as current models and many future models do possess heavy metals like cadmium and lead which will damage the environment badly if they leech off the panels. 

hydro-electric dams harm the environment in a big way, they don't just harm their immediate surroundings, they harm the whole river Eco-system; especially anything living down the stream. just look at the GERD on Nile river, it is causing so many problems for the Nile delta. on top their negative environmental impact, they also cost crazy amounts to build. and the climate change is starting to make dams, which are considered as the most reliable renewable, much less reliable. global temperature is increasing and the weather is getting more and more unpredictable with many more extremes. even though dams are not as tricky as solar or wind, and not usually affected by weather; they do depend on the climate of the region. extreme droughts and abnormal and sometimes excessive rain patters are decreasing their renowned reliability. also, building one, in and of itself, is very bad for the environment.

geothermal has its own series of problems. the best example would be that the water used in the geothermal facilities can get contaminated with very toxic elements and compounds. so, they require careful management to not harm the environment. they are not really cheap to build and manage either, and are very location specific (even more so than the dams).

bio-fuel and biomass, aren't safe from problems either, first of all they do require a lot of land, land that can be used to grow the stuff we need to eat and feed our livestock. so scaling them up to a global level, even if you have some super algae, is not feasible at this point or in near future.

so, no there is no clean energy. but if you are still gonna insist on calling renewables clean, then you need to call nuclear clean, too. let's look at current and old fission first. even if you take every bad impact from mining to building to the chernobyl and fukushima accidents nuclear fission would still be the cleanest and the safest, energy source we have by the ratio of the energy it provides the world. we already have half a thousand of them around the world which are active. so, when was the last time you heard any of them other than the two above failing in bad way? you won't hear such a new. why? because our current reactors are among the most heavily regulated things on the whole planet. modern reactors have so many built in fail-safes and precautions that they nearly never fail, and even when they do they almost never fail in a catastrophic way. in all the decades that we had fission, and remember we have half a thousand active ones at this point, only two failed in a bad way. and even these two event are not actually as bad as most people make them up to be. look at chernobyl today. no really, do it. it has become like a huge national park. the image people have in their heads is a complete nonsense. also, while looking at that, search exactly how many people died due to complications caused by the two accidents. the number will surprise you... about the nuclear waste. it is probably the most carefully handled substance there is or has ever been on the whole planet. as long as you put them into a geologically stable place, they don't really cause much problem. and countries around the world are building new and better storage facilities to handle it. the best example of this is probably the Finland with the new facility they are building as we speak.

now let's talk abut fission's tomorrow. newer generation that are being built and tested as we speak are much safer and cheaper than ever before. many of them are intrinsically safe, which means if things start to go bad, they stop themselves. they are virtually meltdown-proof, even in the case of something as impossible as that, they have plenty of other precautions to prevent things from getting worse. also, they are way cheaper than the old ones. many designs are much smaller (some can be put on planes or ships) and there are even some designs whose main parts can be produced industrially, thus bring down the costs much further and make them far easier to implement. also, the waste problem has been addresses in multiple ways. firstly, many design can use the waste products of the older generations, breaking them down even further which makes its waste decay in a far shorter time period, a couple of centuries instead of thousands of years. also the preferred fuel is thorium which is 3 to 4 times more abundant than uranium, can't be turned into proper weapons. we use its most abundant isotope of it (Th-232), which is actually not fissile. when we want to use it as fuel, we turn it into uranium-233, buy giving it a neutron. this means you don't have to worry about thorium giving you cancer. it doesn't give off ionizing radiation. though the newer designs are safe and melt-down proof regardless of the elements they use (some can work with either). look at molten salt reactors as they are like the poster-child of the new generation. also, new generations produce much less waste as they are much more  efficient and as i said, those waste products decay in just a couple of centuries.

let's look at fusion now. it is literally the cleanest energy possible or imaginable. i somewhat understand the criticism about fission, but how on earth can you even call fusion not clean? no, like seriously how? it has by far the least negative impact on the environment, there is like a ginormous chasm between fusion and the closest competitor in terms of cleanness. all you need to worry about is building the reactor. which in terms of the energy it can provide, its impact on the environment would still be way lower than any other system. you talked about the fuel needing to mined and processed. it seems you have missed one of the most crucial aspects of the nuclear energy, which is they don't need much fuel. the mining argument is just utter nonsense, especially if we think about fusion. fuel for fusion is completely trivial. all you need to do is process the water. and all you need is just a tiny bit. there is actually so much fuel in the oceans that, the sun will probably engulf the planet long before we can finish it. even for the fission, this argument would be nonsense. a similar thing applies. you don't need to do a lot of mining. a lit bit of fuel suffices. for uranium, you don't even need to mine actually. there is enough of it dissolved in the ocean to power the whole world for thousands of years. and thorium is actually a byproduct of the rare earth mining, which we mine for  not just the renewables, but for wide variety of different technologies. so, we don't really need to go mine for it specifically. so, all things considered. if renewables are considered clean, then nuclear must be considered clean as well, regardless of fission and fusion; but especially fusion.",-0.9982,1924

This eliminates much of the storage needs.
