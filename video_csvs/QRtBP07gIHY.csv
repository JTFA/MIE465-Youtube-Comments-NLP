Other times apparently people want to watch shitty shades of smut on film. 

 It's like the way Ladybird is the typical highschool drama, and yet not at all the glazed over trope you see in TV and movies where the experience is so far removed from the reality. It may hit all the same points, theater, bad boy, popularity attempt, out of state college, homesickness, but it isn't cheap. It's more grounded in real life experiences.",-0.9378,173

And this is definitely NOT original. Like some other commenter state...Mary Poppins.

Yeah it won't kill us we all had our mothers do it and our mothers mothers so. Now a days even the most healthiest people get cancer and who knows what causes it or if it's just more hereditary certain ones in people. That's life people get sick sometimes and some people don't. I know a lady she is a hundred and five now and she likes milk in fact her favorite food is ice cream which everyone says you should be vegan now a days and that milk will give you cancer lol Anyway she was never an athletic person either and she dosn't workout  but she not overweight so I'm not sure how she lived so long I guess just genes. I also read this story about this woman she was over a hundred years old and she had been drinking four Dr.Peppers a day for like over forty years so I think it's just in the genes because people claim soda will kill you or get you illnesses and the cans or something. She actually said she feels her Dr. Peppers are what are keeping her living long. I think what really makes us live long is being happy and not stressing over every little thing! And accept your life and be happy in it and not trying to keep up with the Joneses. Also don't stress too much about every little thing and sometimes indulge to make yourself happy but don't over do it you know.,0.9847,260

"Yup four time mother here and what April said is right on. Room temp is the goal to work towards. I've done running hot water, microwave and shake bottle and good ole room temperature. That is with formula though, for breast milk I just let them breast feed then it's perfect temperature. Never had much luck with breast pumps.",0.836,66

"hm. i definitely hear what you're saying. that's a big part of why i see movies. 

but i won't lie - one of the reasons i loved, for example, good will hunting, was because the protagonist and a lot of his friends were working class. seeing a janitor on screen as a protagonist made me feel less shitty that i had to work a job like that.

that might not be the most apt comparison, bc good will hunting wasn't quite as depressing as the trailer makes this film seem. but anyway.

i think that's the appeal of these more ""real life"" drama films. it's so people can see stories they relate to, and get to feel like those stories ARE worth something, that there's something to be gained in telling them.

i can get how this wouldn't be some folk's cup of tea. but i think this kind of art does serve an important purpose, even if the purpose is more abstract than entertainment or escape",0.9893,186

"nbkcq28 ""male lead whose story shows how difficult being a husband/father is (not bc of the difficulty of those roles, mind you, but bc the man has obligations to his job)"" describes a lot of movies. possibly depicting the difficulty of people's lives is just a common plot in movies and not a threat to movies specifically abt men and male struggles? the thing abt capitalism and a free market entertainment industry is that you don't actually have to go see a movie you don't want to. no one is making you worship anything... just don't see the movie.

i understand your comment was tounge in cheek but it's very unrelated to the poster's original point. i'm not sure i understand the need to say something like that unless you somehow feel threatened by this movie.",0.821,152
