"(Spoilers) I disliked the movie. I didn’t hate it, I disliked it. Plenty of scenes were pretty cool, but the Rose and Finn sub plot stripped me from my enjoyment of those scenes. Not to mention completely axing off Snoke like he’s just another stormtrooper without a proper backstory or any character development whatsoever. I thought everyone’s acting was good and the action scenes were perfectly enjoyable to watch, however the lack of character development and unnecessary sub plots make it a pretty mediocre film. I appreciate the time and effort put into it, but the result was a messy film. 

But I must say how obnoxious and toxic some of these comments are. Many are so positive to the fact that Chris was paid, and it’s embarrassing as a fan of movies and this channel. Please make up your minds. People have different opinions than you.",0.9833,172

"@Chris Stuckmann I AM ACTUALLY SHOCKED! I thought you were going to HATE this movie...

My own personal thoughts, At first I was disappointed but still entertained, but after a second viewing, I really enjoyed it, a Third and I noticed things that SO MANY SO CALLED TRUE FANS MISSED, and a Forth I decided while its not the BEST Star Wars movie, as with the prequels, I can actually appreciate what Rain Johnson was aiming for... and I think he did it well...

But as usual there is the Rey is a Mary Sue backlash.. WHICH I HATE! So, Yeah, I am actually very happy to see your review as it is NOT what I expected... Glad I am not teh only person who can appreciate it for what it is... (Christ maybe its age... After all, I have grown up with the Franchise for its full 40 YEARS! And much as I love it and always have - Come on! We all have to admit that there are some seriously goofy choices in the OT! And whether fans like it or not - If Rey is a Mary Sue, She is following Star Wars Tradition as LUKE IS THE ORIGINAL MARY SUE OF STAR WARS!!! IT'S TRUE SO GET OVER IT! [The Whole Force thing is an allegory for Religion... WHY does no one seem to understand that! Luke found faith which gave him power - Rey has heard the stories but never believed until it happens to her... ITS THE SAME THING - ONLY DIFFERENCE IS REY IS A WOMAN!!! AND THEY WONDER WHY FANS ARE BEING BRANDED SEXIST?] )",0.9687,310

"Chris I'm sorry I love you but what the hell where you smoking while watching this movie. This movie was terrible. I was super hyped for it, saw all the good reviews, then watched the movie and was incredibly disappointed. This movie did not feel like it's own thing, people say the force awakens had too many callbacks to the old movies well this one was worse. Every single scene I kept saying to myself hey it's that thing from return of the Jedi or look remember that from empire strikes back or oh look it's that scene from empire again. And I absolutely hated Luke, I completely agree with Hamill, he did not feel like the same character. The comedy felt like it was trying too hard and came in at inappropriate moments, moments that were supposed to be serious but sacrificed that for a cheap laugh. Plus all the plotholes, everything that was established in the force awakens was thrown out the window in this movie. Wasn't it established in the force awakens that luke created the map so they could find him whenever they needed him? Well guess not cuz apparently in the last Jedi he never wanted to be found he just wanted to die. Snoke was hyped up to be this super powerful villain and he was taken out like a bitch. Sure the action when there was action was cool but not enough to save the movie for me. This movie sucked. Episode 3 was better than this and I'm not exaggerating.",-0.9478,279

SPOILERS FROM HERE!!!!! 



PC bullshit all over the place, the side story with  Fin and Rose hurted my eyes, the bullshit destruction of the dreadnought, the death of Luke was the worst death of a main charakter I have ever seen in a movie! Boring and completely wasted and useless! If he had died in the laserstorm Kylo fired on him it would have been way better and funnier, still stupid but better. Leia flying like Superman and not dying in Space?!!!! What is she? Is she related to Freezer from DBZ? Did I miss something? Ray capable of doing everything without any training, still?!!! And now my favorite, the death of Snoke! Why putting him into the movie in the first place when killing him off like that? Who is he? Where did he come from? Why is he so strong with the dark side by not beeing a Sith? WE DON`T FUCKING KNOW and we most likely never will BECAUSE HE FUCKING DIED! JUST LIKE THAT because the director got sick of him just like he got sick of Kylos mask. The only thing that protected the viewers from seeing the ugly face he has! And what about the knights of Ren? Fuck them who cares?! Fuck this movie! Snoke is so powerfull and nearly allmighty with the force and did not notice the fucking lightsaber turning next to him? WTF!!! And his throne room beeing nearly empty except for this stupid spyglass standing in a corner?! And what about Phasma? Seriously?! After giving this great actress nearly no screentime in the first movie now this? The storywriter, the director everybody related to the major descisions in this movie are incompetent assholes who should never ever make a movie again!....So much bullshit it is really sad and I am so angry because I paid 40 Euros for the tickets, 5 Euros for parking and 30 Euros for fucking pocorn and coke FOR THIS SHIT?!!! (And yes here in germany cinema is ridiculously espensive: one big coke+big box of pop corn+ a few gummi bears 15 Euros and I went with my girlfriend and I spend 75 Euros for this shit! ) Again how in the world could you like this movie even a little?

My Rating - 1.5/10",-0.8051,81
"I believe its very tough for the Star Wars franchise to really break ground into new territory without people and fans becoming completely disgusted. I believe touching the Star Wars franchise is plutonium, because if you try something completely out of left field while telling a reasonable story, fans begin calling the film garbage, declaring it doesn't even feel like Star Wars. Then when you try to stay in line with what's already been done, and tell a good story similar to what feels veryuch Star Wars audiences feel it didn't break any new ground or tackle anything new.
I liked the Last Jedi. I believe it told a solid story, had some on the nose fun while telling it, and had some good groundbreaking surprises that wowed me. Some minor complaints. It doesn't follow the setup of JJ Abrams much by answering the questions of the force awakens. (Snoke) 
It also handled the end of Luke a little bit too lightly. Other than that I loved the ballsy choices we get from Johnson. Leia using force pull reflex. Luke being a stubborn old hermit like Yoda. Hyperspace jump through destroyer. Reys parentage being no connection to anything. Low on the lightsaber usage. Force transfer projection.
Once again Chris, I found myself enjoying this film, as you did. Only difference was I loved the Casino bit. It was not disjointed for me. It wasn't forced. It was well crafted, well told, and a damn good chase sequence. Benicios betrayed wasn't useless. Sometimes in life you need something from someone. They say they'll help you out and then screw you. Same thing here. I believe he used Finn and Rose to escape and fully intended to help but was made a better offer by the first order. Hey doublecrosses happen. They suck but they certainly make for very good tension in film. I've also been missing smart ass Dagoba Yoda for a while. It was nice to see Luke struggling as usual, and wise ass Yoda come in and basically face slap him and tell him snap out of it.
All in all I enjoyed this film and did not think it was poorly handled or executed. I have to give it an 8 out of 10. Very mind-broadening choices by Johnson, while clearly remaining very much invested in the story of Rey, Finn, and Poe.",0.9078,443
"I cant understand Why people Think that This is a great/entertaining movie. This movie literally took it to a next shitty level and i thought that after the force awakens it couldnt get more Dumb plots,unseriousnes and just that the story literally is about a rebellion trying to escape and that the term ""hope"" is used constantly and the movie is so predictable. And the fucking same movie plot like the triology, its like they cant come up with New ideas. And that is so Dumb. 
Imagine that the produceres and all the people that are writing this story sit in a room and cant find any good movie plots than What they already did fucking 30 years ago. And they earn millions of dollars each for maling a dumb movie plot because people dont give a fuck about the plot the only thing they Think about is that it have ""Star wars in the title, and that people say they follow the plot and that it is very good but in the end forget What it all was about because they were busy laughing their ass off for some dumb reason like that Luke threw away a lightsaber that were really important in the SW saga or that He ignored Ray that wanted training so that She could get her jedi powers.
Or that when yoda showed up and set fire to very important Jedi books. 

The list is fucking infinite and that is basically the last Jedi.

"I didn't even listen to the his critic...I don't know him but I just wanted to express my humble opinion about the movie that I saw last night (downloaded because I didn't want to give my money to those criminals). I'm an old and huge fan of star wars and I can only tell you that I fell asleep while watching it.... I didn't puke because I never puke even when I'm drunk as shit... it's a problem indeed and I couldn't find any relief last night. There is no single point or feature to save. Everything is lost and fans are also to blame because they often fall in the ""hype"" trap. So, what happens? Because of that stupid hype we go to the cinema and pay those fucking dollars or euros that directly go to Dinsney's financial statement. It is a disgrace because we are still the fuel that nurtures that shit. However, everything was wrong in the movie ranging from the camera (important point in Lucas' Star Wars) to the disgusting plot. Do you know what I mean about camera, right? That particular magic that Lucas was able to create with his ability to shot and also with that filter of magic: that filter made you thinking that I'm here and they are indeed far and far away. This today camera tv series usage is an abomination.... I was watching Lost and not Star Wars. I don't want to mention the characters that will fall, in fact,  in a complete oblivion.

"I don't know how you were fine with ygid movie. As a movie it was akin to fast and the furious or transformers. As a  star wars movie, it was terrible. Continuity in theme or facts don't seem to matter in this film. 

Finn doesn't know how to pilot in ep7, no problem. Now he does in ep8 with 2 separate scenes showing he knows how how to pilot now. 

Rey knows how to swim?

Hyperspace weaponized wouldn't have worked because of mass shadows which are one of the reasons why exploring the unknown region is difficult. 

Why didn't any one shoot Finn and rose on Crait? He had to have dragged her a mile or more on flat terrain without dying.

Holdo not telling ANYONE the plan is stupid and a plot device to make the movie work at all on a faux  dramatic level. 

Rey once again beat kylo but this time he was fully healed and in peak condition so we are left with a villain who poses no threat to our main character who is perfect in every way and had all the boys wanting her in one way or another.

Rey is still a Mary sue unfortunately.

The force was watered down to be all inclusive and given without earning anything. 

There were no y-wings, the go to bomber for the rebels. Instead you have a kamikaze bomber that tend to kill themselves and are made of paper so Johnson can have his pseudo ww2 scene.

Johnson thought it was cool to subvert the audience at every turn without offering a cool alternative. Instead we are left with literally nothing for all the big characters.

Your advice is deeply flawed and is always going to be only 30% useful to other people. Your words can only change the course of the star wars legacy. That very a unfortunate effect. There are people still alive who know, who were there! Who are still living the Star Wars life effect. The historian, which is what you are, must SEEK those people living the Star Wars dream.

Ok Guys here is the bottom line.  It is the worst Star Wars movie so far. The story telling is poor and technically it is bad. If you saw the movie and watched this review you know Chris is in the bag for Disney.  Adam Driver is not a good villain and Rey is not trained as a Jedi but she can defeat anyone including those who have trained since they were a child with a light saber.  This movie is one for the garbage bin.  This film could be the beginning of the end unless the next one gets this saga back on track,-0.8831,111

I really hoped Rian Johnson didn’t go to the direction that everyone expected Luke to be this wise Jedi, but really a troubled man filled with regret and guilt, completely different from the last time we’ve seen him.

Once the Empire took control and destroyed everything, making Yoda flee and hide someplace, we don’t see him until Empire, and he’s completely different. He still had that wisdom, but something about him felt so off from his origin. Nevertheless, I really loved it.",0.7801,135

"Suggestions to fix the movie: 
1: Give a little context in the opening crawl. Why did the resistance not get any support anywhere? What happened in the wake of the destruction of starkiller base?

2: remove Finn + Rose arc. Gone. Poof. (I will come back to how later). Finn wakes up before the movie, or after the First Order chase after them in hyperspace. No walking around like a clown. Just an abrupt wake up and ask where they are and where/how Rey is and what's happening. The guy is a soldier and (supposedly) a good guy, have him act like one at times. He is dissatisfied with Rey gone, but doesn't immediately turn tail, like in the movie. Poe, his only friend on board, instead persuades him to stay.

3: When Nox fails to kill Poe and loses the Dreadnought, Snoke scolds him for it and congratulates the second in command for his promotion. Nox asks if he is getting demoted, and his only response is an obviously painful death as he is choked before his body is crushed and slammed into the deck.

4: Polish the Luke/Rey arc. Have Rey struggle to learn. A talent does not mean instant success. Show people that there is a limit to what she can do. As of the movie, she basically succeeds at all she touches. She needs more of a development, not just as a character, but as a light saber and force user. Luke should also (reluctantly) warm up to Rey after the initial fear/dismay/grumpyness. Having the hero himself liking a character will make her more likable for the audience. Luke, a grumpy war-veteran/hermit is not a good character if all they say is no. Here I would refer to the great ""Yes, but"" (""Yes I'll come with you, but not until I'm ready to leave/you are done with your training/you promise we continue training, etc...""). Also, cut the soap in the Rey/Kylo sessions. Kylo's rage/anger should be given a good show here. Instead, we have ""Trauma support chat"" with Kylo and Rey. Show, don't tell us about the trauma. Tease us with the parents and give us emotional conflict (here meant as developing antagonistic relations after Kylo refuses her help/counsel). 

5: When Kylo can't kill Leia. His wingmen destroy the bridge. Ackbar should not have been present (although he will die later), Leia is seen floating into space, and remains that way. (No deus ex Mary Poppins). Luke feels her demise and rushes Rey and Chewie off the planet after making Rey promise to finish the tranining. Have Kylo face the consequences of failure, both the failure to protect his last remaining family and failing to do his masters' bidding. Remove Holdo. Ackbar takes her place and tells Poe about the plan when it comes to it, elaborating that this was Leias' last plan. This removes the need for the casino trip. 

6: Rey never travels to ""The absolute"" in order to confront Kylo. Sensing the danger that lies within, and regroups with the resistance. Here she goes to Crait with after the resistance have landed. The Falcon,  with Chewie, Luke, and Rey enters the scene just in time for them to identify Finn, who (just as he intended) crashes into the siege cannon. In the absence of Nox, Phasma is leading the AT-walkers. The siege cannon explodes, destroying the nearby AT-walkers. Phasma's fate is left unknown. Only after seeing the Falcon, realising that Rey is there. Close up on the face of regret and purpose as he realises what his sacrifice means. Luke shoots the ATs ""just like old times"", and the rebels rally at the sight of the Falcon. 

7: The Duel/faceoff takes place after most of the AT have been neutralized. Luke and Rey faces off against Kylo. They get the upper hand, but as Luke is about to end Kylo, two things happen. Luke hesitates for a second, and Kylo ends his former master. Thus he ""kills"" his final tie to his past. We then hear Snoke speaking, his voice amplified by the force to come from everywere: ""You have lost this, surrender to me."" Out of nowhere, a few shots kick up the salt. Accompanied by Poe, who tells her to make a run for it. She does. As Kylo sets out to stop her, we see him restrained by something. That something which held him back is of course Snoke, snickering as he says: ""I will enjoy watching you hunt down the last jedi. Do not fail me this time.""

"You were conned into following a product you can't possibly know anything about. It's very sad and I feel sorry for the youth of today who've been destroyed by a generation 2 levels above mine. Movies died in the 1990's. if you don't get that impression, you should leave the movie world for a while and experience some other interest. The young are being fed on trash!

You´re being to wayyy to permissive with the sequels Chris. Also how do you find Captain Tarpals annoying? Or you're just saying it for the sake of bashing the prequels in comparison?,-0.4696,37

Come on.
This movie has bad acting, the plot is the classic that Disney always has and its full of plot holes.
In general all the star wars movies are bad, but this one is shit.",-0.8934,43

how much did google pay you for that rating chris?,-0.1027,11
i actually loved when rey leaves in anger after realizing luke wouldnt train. also the reason for crait battle to fight back while waiting for some help if anyone got their message,-0.3182,33
i would give TLJ a D,0.0,6
"i'm new to starwars. i was going into this movie without really any knowledge tbh. sure, i knew some of the characters names but that was basically it. when i watched this movie, i was really impressed. i preferred it over hunger games even. i'm kinda an artsy person so i rlly appreciate in depth characters and designs. the fact the creatures had their own designs was rlly cool to see. i like how they're a hybrid of different animals. gives me a little bit of an anime feel. similar to avatar the last airbender but with more space like things haha. very likable characters too. i'm a dude whose a sucker for villains so seeing kylo ren.... definitely a favourite character of mine. in some ways, i felt like he was pretty realistic with his hurt feelings. but i liked rey as well i found it hard to hate any character in this film - everything was entertaining. the action was rlly well too. very cool stuff. had a great time.",0.9845,193
"if there's anything that I've learned from Stuckmann's reviews of the force awakens and the last Jedi, it's that fans can't handle opinions different from their own. if you hate these movies go ahead and hate them. but not everyone has to feel the same way as you. remember, in his review of the phantom menace, even though he disliked it he said that he was aware that some people like it and said that that that's okay. to quote him, he said ""you're allowed to enjoy the phantom menace."" which you are. and he's allowed to enjoy the force awakens and the last Jedi. how would you like it if Stuckmann said ""if you like the phantom menace you're an idiot George Lucas cocksucker.""'",-0.1531,142
"its just like epidsode 3 and episode 4. both the films vary vastly in terms of production. i mean visuals and all

also this movie didnt had absurdity like the starkiller base.",0.6124,35

No offense, but he knows star wars better than Stuckmann.",-0.4854,17
like it better than TFA too like you ONLY BECOZ IT WASNT A REMAKE/REHASH.,0.7845,17
"lili ks Why is it so hard to accept the fact that someone can like this movie? He isn’t like Jeremy Jahns who has sponsorships every other episode. He may give sponsors once in a while but that’s it. He isn’t some shill on the internet who blindly loves films. His fan base was so pure when he was around 300k, and ever since he reached a million, it’s so easy to have that “feeling” of thinking Chris is bribed all the time for giving a movie that you don’t like, a positive review. It’s very fucking stupid.",0.9736,121
"lili ks “someone that can help make a movie more popular” that’s not the point of his reviews. He expressed his opinion that many people seem to have a problem with. Never give a him a view? He has one million subscribers, I don’t think he gives two fucks for people like you. Good that you won’t respond, maybe then you’ll learn you’re rightful place. Lol",0.6249,85

"the only thing that really didnt make sense to me was that a map to skywalker exists, but when skywalker is found there is no point for that map because he says 'i came here to die' and that achtoo was supposed to be 'unfindable'. so the treatment of luke was a little weird, but other the that this movie was a total blast. i didnt really get all the sjw vibes that i have heard so much about, but i am not really the kind of moviegoer that picks apart a movie looking for hidden messages.",-0.8677,107
"there are many people who liked the movie. Chris so happens to be one of them. Objectively, it is a good movie, you can see a proffesional critic (like Chris) explain it. So, just because YOU didn't like it, it doesn't mean that it's a bad movie and that no one else should like it.Also, the audience score is biased as shit. Suicide squad has a 60% positive audience score while it's complete horse shite.",-0.8983,88
