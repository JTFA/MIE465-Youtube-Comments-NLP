"A few questions if anyone from this channel actually answers questions...

1) I have hot water out of my tap at ~65C (~149F), all I use is hot water and a large cooler (I'm in a place where I spend no money on power or water). Temps range for about a 2 hour 15 min cook from ~65C to 60C (150 - 140 F) and since I like a nice medium rear steak, this seems to be a good temp. Would I actually gain anything by spending money on a med range sous vide machine? 

2) You stated in this video time determines how well done a steak is. In my research time doesn't (since the temp doesn't increase over time) rather time translates to how broken down the meat is. What is your opinion in your experience?

3) 130 F (about 54C) equates more to a rare steak in my experience, but you stated medium here. Did you change temps at any point?",0.5802,192

No you don't change the time depending on how well done you want it. Thats for conventional cooking. In Sous Vide cooking you set the Temperature to the temp that you want the item cooked for. Once the item reaches that temperature it cannot go any higher because there is no higher temperature to raise it up.
