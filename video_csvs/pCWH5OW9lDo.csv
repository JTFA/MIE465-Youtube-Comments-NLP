Hundreds of years from now, we will no longer be confined to the bonds of our Solar System. Humans will grow as a species far beyond what we are today. We will have taken over all the planets in our Solar System. We will have exited the gravitation pull of Sol, our own sun, and will explore other solar systems. We will find life. Life that may be the end of our species, or that may be a friend to it. None the less, space is our only option for a viable future. Our planet is being dried of it‚Äôs natural resources.
