I really don't get this product. Do other women usually wear yoga pants without underwear? Because I don't so I sure as hell won't start doing that while on my period of all times. And what's wrong with wearing a tampon or cup for exercise? If you can't wear those you could use regular pads (or period panties for security) instead and wear loose exercise pants to hide them. The idea of letting the blood soak into my not easily changeable pants actually disgusts me and I would feel the need to wash them right after every use (instead of waiting until I have a full load of laundry) wich isn't exactly environmentally friendly.,-0.9664,124

"I think instead of a gusset the pants should have incorporated a completely covered underwear area like most full coverage period panties. What's the point if you can't really moved or workout? I mean unless you're using a cup or something internally and it acts as a back-up, I think this product doesn't deliver.
Still hooked to my DivaCup, and I liked your Thinx video.",0.6486,71
I think the gusset should probably just be like a panty liner for tampons,0.3612,14
"I think the only problem I would have is that I don't want to have to wash a load off clothes everyday. Seems like a waste of water and electric. Then again, tampons and pads do cause a lot of waste.",-0.7203,45
"I think there's a misconception with the first type. I believe it's for women who prefer pads over tampons or cups. The second type with the build in, more incognito pad, I believe was made for tampons and cups. No matter what you do, the cervix changes height, so you have to work with it. I know some women who own about 3 cups for those body changes. That's what lunapads and period panties are for.",-0.2732,86
