"My friend says “see! Why workout or do cardio?! Wasting heart beats is all you’re doing!” Actually, let’s say you do cardio for 45 minutes every day. Well, in a day, for 45 minutes you would indeed be expending 3-4 times more heart beats than usual. Consequently(due to your disciplined regimen), your resting heart rate would slow to somewhere between the 30-50 beats per minute range(down from the average of 60-80). Over the course of the remaining 23 hours of the day(not even taking into consideration your heart rate when sleeping), you’d more than compensate for your strenuous session. In fact(as your conditioning improves), eventually you’d be burning heart beats when resting AND while exercising at a much more efficient rate.",0.7628,158
