"AWESOME!!!!!!!! I was saddened when I discovered them in 2013 and found they had disbanded, but so pleased to see they are back and doing music again!! I was introduced to them through a very rare interview the group did in fall 2002 on MTV's site where Chris Carrabba praised Missy Elliott as among his favorite songwriter & idol. So happy they didn't shift their sound for the sake of mainstream trends. Definitely copping this & supporting 'em. Rock on fellas",0.9822,91

"[Verse 1]
We were the kids that left home probably too young
But we took our share and maybe then some
Tired of beatings and battles and being sewn up
But that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out

[Chorus]
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out

[Verse 2]
And there's still a kid somewhere that needs to hear this
That somebody cares, that somebody knows
Who's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up
Just pick yourself up, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out

[Chorus]
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out

[Bridge]
Maybe we found a way to make some tracks
We didn't snicker and turn our backs
We just keep digging in, and digging in, and giving back

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out",-0.9975,382
