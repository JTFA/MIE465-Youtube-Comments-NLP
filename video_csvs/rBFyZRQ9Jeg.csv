"DamonAndJo Those candies are very unpopular among most icelandic ppl. Only Draumur is like ""popular/good"". That bag was a rip-off .. :/.  Anyways, this candy you guys were askin 'bout hasnt been around for so long (honestly). The date only meant that this company (Freyja) was founded at that date. 
Too bad you guys didnt get proper/good Icelandic Candy.",-0.25,77
"Do what Icelanders do is we “bend” the words and thats why we have Freyja and Freyju. So you would say :
Here is Freyja
About Freyju
From Freyju
To Freyju
And that is bending the name Freyja.
I don’t know why the brands name is Freyja but it is bent that way to follow one of Iceland’s rules on grammar (the reason why it is so hard to learn Icelandic)",-0.3181,81

"Freyja is the name of the norse goddess of fertility, and interestingly she does have a brother who's name is Freyr, so that was a good guess about what Freyju means. But ""Freyju"" is still the female goddess. Icelandic is a language that declines all nouns, so ""Freyju"" means from Freyja, it's kind of like Kellogg's Kornflakes, Freyju Súkkulaði means Chocolate made by Freyja (the name of the candy company your entire bag of goodies was from). Also the logo is a cat because Freyja in the norse mythology rode a wagon dragged by cats.",0.7827,110

"I love how controversial things like liquorice and Marmite are. All the more for the few of us that love the stuff! ;Þ

P.S. - Icelandic has all the cases that German has, but in Iceland names are conjugated as well, so 'Freyja' becomes 'Freyju' in all cases other than the nominative, and in this case I'm guessing it's the genitive. :D
