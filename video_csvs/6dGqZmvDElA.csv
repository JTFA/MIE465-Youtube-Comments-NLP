"At the end of the day, its population as well and the structure of the city you live in. If I take the subway everyday and I'm in crowded places more often than not I would be more inclined to pick up a mask no matter what the public perception is. There are also some situations in Japan and Asia in general where the ""personal bubble"" you are used to in the west might be broken. For example space on the subway during peak hours, there just isn't  enough room and people are crammed into a small space . Now if I live in the suburbs and spend my commute in my car alone and  interact with a handful of people a day, a mask isnt high on my health priority list. I think the number of interactions you have with strangers  per day and your proximity to those strangers is an important factor here.",-0.4588,165

I don’t believe that it’s some magical barrier that stops you from getting ill, but it does help a lot. I’m often in very busy areas (which I’m not the most fond of) and in winter when a lot of people have colds, I like when people use masks to avoid the spread through runny noses, sneezing and coughing. I know it doesn’t fully block everything out but I find it’s generally nicer. 
Also, I have a lot of allergies, my throat gets really scratchy and swells around dust, pollen and basically everything, using the mask does help against this. I still have to take medication but it prevents overexposure.",0.3972,161

I saw something the other day referring to the thumbs up as the middle finger in Australia...though not true I think this is getting confused with the reverse peace sign.
