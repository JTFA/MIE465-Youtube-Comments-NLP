"I think the show ""Storm Chasers"" is CURSED!  One of the stars of the show, Matt Hughes, at 30 years of age committed suicide when he and his wife were having trouble.  Then, Tim Samaras, his 24-year-old son, and Carl Young were killed when a tornado made a sudden change in direction and trapped them.  And now, Joel Taylor dies in an apparent overdose/deadly drug combination.  The people on the show obviously had a dangerous profession, but the body count is getting ridiculous.",-0.9117,101

We're born.
We live.
We die.
Death has no respect dear.
He's cold, hard and will surely win in the end.
The best and only revenge is to live every minute you can.
Keep your head clear.
Grab hold of all the good you possibly can while you're here.
And when death does come for you, meet him with a smile, standing up.
Reach out to shake his hand.
And with the other, make a fist, and dot his eye one more time.
