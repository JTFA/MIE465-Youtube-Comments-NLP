"Running from the morning 
Think I hit a wall
Late night, not you 
Running from the moment 
So I don’t recall
Late nights, not you

Waking up in a cold sweat 
Someone else in this cold bed 
I’d do anything to not be alone 
All alone with the ceiling 
All alone with this feeling 
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

I tried spending my nights under 
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Yeah yeah yeah 
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

Drowning in my coffee 
To wash the alcohol 
Out my bloodstream 
Sitting here I wonder 
If we hadn’t been at all 
Who would I be

Waking up in a cold sweat 
Someone else in this cold bed 
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you 

Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you",0.9629,236
