"Adam Lambert would have been a much better choice, but no one's performance will ever compare to Ian Gillan's, from the original album!",0.3382,26
All the experts are out basing his entire performance on 20 seconds!,0.0,13
Are these vocals supposed to be good? Sounds like me when I'm trying to sing in a range I don't have. Whoever thought Legend could sing the songs of Jesus? This whole cast has me uninterested now.,0.6966,41
Awful vocals.,-0.4588,3
Can't wait to see this John legend will kill it. It's 2018 people not every singer will sound like the version you have heard or know best. Give him a shot.. this is a rehearsal video ...relax,0.25,41
Decent vocals but I am still not watching this!,0.0,10
Desmond Gentle his voice is weird and I'd much rather have steve or john legend that ted. He was always my least favorite part of that movie.,-0.0721,29
He can sing but can he act? Maybe he'll be the male counterpart to Carrie Underwood in Sound of Music,0.0,21

"I actually really liked glenn carter as jesus, tbh.",0.4754,11
I don't know why you guys are lambasting him. I thought he was gonna be bad until I heard this. Stop comparing him to ted neeley because ted neeley wasn't that good. Steve Balsamo was better than ted.,-0.6711,42
"I honestly think heâ€™s going to be great. Heâ€™s no Ted Neeley, but itâ€™s way better then that garbage they did in the early 2000s. Crossing my fingers for Adam Lambert as Judas!",0.7959,43
I hope he gets Judas!,0.4926,6
I like Steve Balsamo as well.,0.5574,7
"I love this show and I've taught this score to skilled singers when I was the Musical Director, but I must say the casting of John Legend as Jesus is a misfire. This part needs a Chester Bennington (RIP), Steve Perry, Arnel Pineda, or a Jared Leto type of vocalist. Bruno Mars, Usher, Trey Songz, or Rashaan Patterson would have been great as Judas. John Legend is better suited vocally as Peter. Check out John Farnham of the Australian cast , sing the part of Jesus if you want an ethereal experience!",0.9305,106
"I mean, can he even sing? You saw how he struggled with those notes",-0.34,16
I pray that this is an April fools joke.,0.0772,10
"I think NBC intentionally miscasts people, just so people can tune in and see how bad it is.",-0.5423,20
Impressive but still flat :( where's that ted Neely power?,-0.4019,11
It's live in concert. No staging. There are no spoken words in this show. So he should be good.,-0.128,23
John legend I want you to sing getshmane,0.0772,8
"Just play the original album with Ian Gillan's vocals and have an actor lip synche, that is, a good actor, not this clown.",0.765,27
Neely was nasal in his pitch too but had a growl to make it more human. I don't know what Legend was doing.,0.0,25
OMG he sounds absolutely awful. He canâ€™t hit those high notes! As a producer did he cast himself in this or what ??!,-0.6413,29
OMG! He was SO off key! They couldn't find a better singer?,-0.457,15
"Oh my... Those vocals are not good. ðŸ˜¬ Sara Bareilles has a skilled voice, but there's some strange casting in this production. I think I'm going to pass.",-0.441,33
"Perhaps you are too young to have heard the original album with Ian Gillan. Maybe when you heard the album, you thought that it was Ted Neely, from the movie. No, it was Ian Gillan, the singer for Deep Purple.",0.0258,47
Please don't. God made Ted Neeley for a reason.,0.1245,11
"Priceless! Can't wait till Easter/April Fools Sunday! No joke at all on that, though.",-0.5837,20
QrystalQlear I know that ted was in the movie and not in the brown album and I don't really understand why you'd think that I made some mistake considering I didn't even talk about the brown album...?,-0.34,39
QrystalQlear no. I've heard the brown album and I've heard the movie and I've heard the broadway and literally every other other version. I don't really know why you'd think I would know ted neeley and not Ian Gillian...,-0.296,42
So upset that itâ€™s just a concert.,-0.4391,10
Sophie Hanssel I hope you are wrong. Lol I'm so worried he will not be able to spar against Ben Daniels as Pontius Pilate.,0.0276,26
That was not good. ðŸ‘Ž ðŸ‘Ž ðŸ‘Ž i need them to stop playing with me. Horrible,-0.7435,18
"That was.. Unimpressive. 
Hopefully he improves. 
Choir boy Jesus' always bore me.
Ted Neeley is still the best.
Ian Gillan 2nd.",0.743,28
This is going to be another horrid remake for TV.  Not interested in watching this one,-0.2023,17
