Bryan Perez .. you are a total idiot. This country was never as divided as it is now. It is people like you making it that way by supporting idiots like these millionaire criminal kneelers and elevating them to anything other than the scumbags they are. I never thought you were black with a name like Perez.. NFSYK,0.4019,62
Bryan Perez.. so you are worse than everyone else. You know what is right and you stand there and want to be so politically correct and  pat yourself on the back for being exceptional. They have divided the country and now they are simply protesting white America. The exact people that line their pockets and treat them with honor. I would say the same to you as I would say to them. Fk off back to Africa if you believe you are oppressed by white America and you wont have the problem. Leave the rest of us to be proud of America.,0.2719,110

First of all i'm not a African american so i don't know what how you got to that conclusion. Now if you wanna cry and moan and complain about our country being divided then you must have been born yesterday because this country has been dealing with this for decades. A bunch of athletes kneeling didn't cause this. Everyone wants to be so nationalistic and patriotic to there country but in reality we are far from perfect. I understand where you are coming from but telling people to go back to Africa is a premature thing to say. Things like that  cause more conflict. It's a shame that as a country we have reached this level of incompetence and hatred. You sound like any other  person pissed of at the world. Do something better with your life mate,-0.9199,146

Hey people here's an idea, instead of putting your head and shoulders down in the 'hope' your opponent is going to be tackled, where he's just bouncing off you like a pinball.....wrap your arms around his legs! Contain the guy's legs - he can't run!!
