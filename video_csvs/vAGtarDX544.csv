I really love your new format! Bringing new faces in, looking at a topic from different perspectives etc. while still bombarding us with interesting, amusing and well-researched facts really works and I am looking forward to many more great episodes in the future. 
The only thing that bothers me (and I know it's nitpicky...) is how obvious it is that you are reading off a teleprompter. Maybe I'm the only one, but it really distracts me from everything that you do so very well.
