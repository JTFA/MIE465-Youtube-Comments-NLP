"+MsSjchic Dude. IM from NY. I damn near grew up on Remy & i STILL have more respect for Nicki. ""Mumbling""? ""Corny punchlines""? ""Pop rap""? HAVE you ever even HEARD a Nicki verse? EVEN EMINEM jacked Nicki's style on one of his songs. EVEN JAY Z praises Nicki as his influence. Tf are you actually talking about? Nicki slaughters LITERALLY every verse. Every single one. Remy sounds like she's slobbering on a turkey bone & has sounded that way since the early 2000's. You make no sense. That's not even shade.",0.7471,115
