"2 points that really annoys me

1) it is just a few trolls with bots that downvoted the score: Yes. There are some and the score wouldnt be that low but just watch a view youtubers reviewing the movie. There are a lot of reviewers that didnt really like this movie. Here some big ones: piewdiepie, angry joe, jeremy jahns...

2) you can not please the fans: No. There are a lot of expended universe stuff that fans universally love. And it is not a big gotcha moment when you say fans complaint that the first one is tooo similar and the second one is too different. Its such a stupid argument. You know that there is a middle ground?. As a action movie fan you can say that this movie has too less action and this movie has too much.",-0.9242,159
"2:10 it is the destruction and subversion of everything that made SW, and worse, it is occurring in the middle of a trilogy that was already partially established! That is the opposite of coherent. Also, these commentators lack integrity. Thumbs down.",-0.7777,48
"30:08 Perhaps unrelated to all this Star Wars talk but y'all bring up Iron Man 3. I don't think Ben Kingsley gets enough love and admiration for pulling off both the facade of The Mandarin and the truth of it. That fake out should have killed Iron Man 3, but Kingsley sells it brilliantly so you're only kind of pissed off. I think the fake out works but mostly cuz they cast the absolute perfect actor in the role. When I try to explain the plot of The Last Jedi to myself it just comes up short. Since when do you run out of fuel in the Star Wars universe? Why doesn't The First Order just flank them? I just deleted several paragraphs where I detail other examples. You're welcome. 

Mark Hamill, like Ben Kingsley in Iron Man 3, is most impressive as an older Luke in The Last Jedi. Hamill knows he's shoveling a shit script but he really sells the bit about how he's not the legend. Luke knows he doesn't live up to people's expectations. It's why he ran away and in the final act it's why he does what he does. He sacrifices himself so that his friends can live on, and as a byproduct the legend will be remembered. It's a good sentiment. Badly told in the script, but like turning Mandarin into a gag, a more than capable actor can rise to the occasion and sell a bad script. I doubt Hamill will even be nominated for an Oscar, but there are very subtle things he's doing with his voice and demeanor (like the scene with R2 listen to that voice you can hear the young Luke for just a second it's precious what he's doing). He pulls off an impossible role facing an impossible challenge in The Last Jedi and he should be commended for it. 

I enjoyed the film in the theater but as I walked out of the film until even now today and probably for some time to come I'm finding myself concerned about the ramifications of this film. TLJ rewrites the rest of the franchise in ways that I'm concerned may adversely affect this franchise in the future. If Rey's parents were nobodies, if Snoke doesn't matter, if a force ghost can just come along and set a tree on fire for no reason, where can we go from here? Perhaps the reason why The Expanded Universe has largely been demoted and turned into Legends is because everything since Splinter of the Mind's Eye has been written based on the rules laid down in the original trilogy. Disney doesn't want to play by those rules and they own the gridiron now so they can do what they want but if I were invited to a casino which sets my expectations to a fair chance of winning but has rigged the games so that I win a few early on but ultimately lose, I'm not gonna accept the next invitation.

Star Wars used to remind me of my childhood. It doesn't anymore. Maybe that's what i find most sad about all this. Yeah, maybe I had a good time? but i still feel ripped off. That might be my problem, but why would I keep coming back just to feel like this again?",0.9387,597
"32:05 This is the one statement I think is what people really need to focus on. When Roth talks about how JJ went to the extreme of playing to the originals and Rian went to the extreme of playing it differently, that's the problem. It's about striking that balance of being original enough while staying true to the overall essence of what Star Wars is and who these characters are. It's hard to do, yes, but it's not impossible. 

Also, the people who said they wanted something different aren't necessarily the same group of people that didn't like this movie because it was too different. The SW fanbase is very broad and diverse. It's very possible that we're talking about two different camps of people. It's likely that it's two different sets of people with just a portion being a part of both camps. And while some of those who are stuck in the middle may be fickle, going back to my earlier paragraph can also validate their thoughts and feelings. After all, sure they may have not liked The Force Awakens because it was too much of the same to them, but swinging to the extreme of making everything different does not and should not mean that they HAVE to be satisfied. They likely weren't asking for EVERYTHING to be different. Or for things to be THAT different. Just different enough to stand on its own and bring something new without feeling as if it is treating the rest of the lore with disrespect for contempt. 

Personally, I enjoyed The Force Awakens, and the only gripe I had was the Star Killer Base being a Death Star 3. I didn't feel like the film was more of the same. I thought it had some new directions and beats, but I can admit that the nostalgia did seem to take precedent over being original. I'm not opposed to having more originality and new things tried out in a SW movie either, but I wasn't demanding it either. Just a few different beats or takes, and I would be fine. So when I watched The Last Jedi I felt like there was too much subversion going on. Oddly enough, that wasn't actually my biggest problem though. The pacing of the movie was the biggest problem to me, and I felt like some characters where pointless or had very little to do with little to no character building or didn't make as much sense to me. So I'd say pacing, writing, and stronger character development and use were bigger problems than the originality of the movie.

Overall, I think it's important to keep in mind that what may work for one person will not work for another. There are people who love the choices that were made, but because we're all different, someone else may not have liked them, and that's all there is to it. There were a lot of things I liked in it such as the characters despite the little some may have had to work with. I don't think anyone had a bad acting performance. The visuals were great. The theme of legends and heroes and what they mean to people and how and when they should be used is very striking. The space battle scenes and the battles were really great. Unfortunately for me, when those things are combined with the overall structure of the movie and the things that I did not like, the movie failed to impress me. I don't hate this movie, but I don't love it either.",-0.8724,648

"Dan you are 99% correct!  Thanks for standing up to these other yahoos.  The only thing you weren't correct about is stating that Disney doesn't need to pander to Star Wars fans.  That's their target audience!  Who else is going to see these movies?  The main point here with this dumpster fire called TLJ, that you were struggling to articulate but the others on the panel were completely clueless about, is the Star Wars formula.  The panel acted like there are only 2 options with these new movies: A- Pander to Star Wars fans and re-make the old trilogy, or B- throw the old trilogy out the window and do something totally new.  There is indeed a third option, and that's what would have made this new trilogy amazing and timeless.

The original trilogy was successful because of its basic themes: good vs evil and its tie-ins to historical motifs.  Joe and the other clowns on the left had the attitude of ""we already saw the Star Wars story with the original trilogy- we want something NEW!""  That's like saying ""Ughhh, I've already heard Revolutionary War, Civil War, and WWI stories, I don't need to hear WWII stories, or Vietnam stories...tell me a NEW story!""  The saga is called Star WARS for a reason. There are infinite numbers of stories to tell...IF YOU'RE CREATIVE ENOUGH.  It's a saga about struggle, and battles against good and evil, so it shouldn't be tough to come up with new stories with new heroes that still tie in to the old movies.  Good hell, go talk to the screenwriters for the X-men movies, they were masters of integrating the X-Men stories into ACTUAL history (Cuban Missile crisis, Magneto tried to save JFK and that's why the bullet curved, etc).  How hard can it be to do the same thing with a fictional Star Wars story?! 

You introduce a powerful force master named Snoke who was around while Palpatine and Vader were ruling the galaxy, and you're too damn lazy to come up with a reason why they didn't know about him?  Or why he stayed in the shadows even though he was arguable more powerful than either of them?  You can't come up with a good story of how a new group of force sensitive individuals could come about, so you try to (unsuccessfully) retcon the entire franchise by stating that ANYONE can use the Force?  Really?  So in your universe up until now NOBODY in the history of the universe who wasn't a Jedi tried using the Force without training- and were successful?  Nobody ever tried to ""breath"" and ""reach out"" til Rey??? Boy Rian Johnson REALLY came up with a good story here. *eye roll* 

Don't downplay the criticism of this movie amongst hardcore fans.  My mom loved it because she ""didn't have to know anything about other characters or other movies in order to understand it.""  That says all you need to know about how much it strayed from the saga. 

Joe you are dead wrong or totally oblivious...Luke throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder, is a direct slap in the face to Star Wars fans (not to mention Leia returning from the dead as Mary Poppins when Carrie Fisher is already dead in real life), and they are reacting accordingly.  Dan you are spot on with the ""re-writing chapter 1 with chapter 2.""  Now what is Abrams gonna do in EP IX?  try to get back to square one after Rian Johnson effed it all up?

They destroyed his character completely for me.

And he sexually assaulted a space cow, #notmylukeskywalker",-0.9471,121
"For all the haters and die hard fanboys who say Johnson felt contempt for fans, and that you have been betrayed, I will offer you another version of The Last Jedi so you can all sleep better:  

Luke didn't try to kill Kylo, but instead Kylo betrayed him, and this made Luke feel like he failed, so he cut himself off from the Force. Rey finds Luke in this state and coaxes him into training her, and when she finally hands him the Light Saber, he realizes the error in ever thinking he failed. It wasn't his fault, but instead the overpowering lure of Darth Plagueis (which we suspected was really Snoke was all along - duh), but our always faithful apprentice Luke, now a master Jedi, finishes training her in a montage scene, and after that is complete, he decides to come with her to defeat Snoke and Kylo. 

During the battle with Snoke and Kylo, Luke loses his other hand but Snoke is killed. Rey realizes that she was wrong about Kylo, as she now understands that anyone who is pulled by the Dark Side must be pure evil, but she can't kill him because she only has Light Side of the Force with her (the Force is only good unless someone abuses it of course). At the end of the battle, Rey is pointing a blaster at Kylo, but he ducks quickly into his command shuttle. She shoots at the engines as he takes off. Kylo loses control from the explosive force of the shot and his ship barrel-roles out of frame. 

Cut to Leia, as she senses Luke's pain and reaches out with the force to guide her wounded brother to the resistance base, but during this force connection, she senses that somehow Luke and Rey are more than just apprentice and master, that, in fact, Rey was guided by the force to Luke, who Leia now knows is Luke's long-lost daughter from a brief affair with an estranged Jedi he knew years ago. Luke doesn't know Rey is his daughter because he has been shut off from the Force for so long, but he senses a strong connection. Luke returns with Rey to the resistance base, but while he is under anesthesia for his arm, Leia whispers in his ear: THERE IS ANOTHER! 

The First Order is on the way to the base as well, but the resistance is saved in the nick of time,  as the good people of the galaxy answer the call and beats back most of the First Order weapons and ships. On the ground, we see Rey and Leia leading the charge, but it is Finn that kills General Hux in a fiery explosion after Finn hits the canon with his speeder and turns it toward the Gorilla Walker - just in the nick of time - whew. But, Captain Phasma emerges from the flames and surprises Leia, putting her down with one fell swoop of her command staff. Rey is overcome with anger, and begins to beat Phasma back with her Light Saber. Luke, now awake, Force connects with Rey and says, my father once made me angry and I learned that killing in anger can only lead to the Dark Side - I hope I can be a better father to you than mine was to me.""  

Enter Kylo, who (surprise) swoops down in his battered command ship and retrieves Phasma with a magnet, and then the pair retreat to fight another day. On board the command ship, we see Kylo and Phasma, now master (and possibly Phasma as his new apprentice), looking down at something on the computer. As the camera pans down to the plans, we see the schematics for another planet sized weapon with a description that says ""The Mega-Gigawatt Death Star"",  which Kylo says is the most powerful weapon ever conceived - capable of destroying entire galaxies. 

Hmmm, what do I do now? I'm stuck with this ending, and it seems like it is heading somewhere so familiar. Oh, of course, in the Episode IX we find out the resistance gets wind of this new (but not really) galaxy destroyer and has sent a message from Rey in BB8. A young boy on a planet without much future will find BB8 and read the message. I think you can figure out what happens next, but I will say that in the end Finn, Rey, and Poe will all get medals, as Chewbacca howls through the end credits and John Williams score.

From the fact of this particular choice of actor being combined with the caliber of his performance, I have no doubt that Snoke was intended a far deeper and broader arc and would have joined the ranks of Serkis' previously mentioned legendary interpretations, this so unconsciously accepted catholically from TFA that it never even crossed many minds to even question his future role's eminence..

Take the space chase scene, where decisions made by protagonists just don’t make sense.  Poe sends Finn/Rose to another planet in an escape pod, but if that can be done, why doesn’t everyone on that cruiser escape the same way?  Admiral Hux only deploys 3 tie fighters against the resistance cruiser.  Chewie/Rey catch up to the chase scene but offer no direct help to their desperate colleagues (why not at least rescue some people on the Falcon).  The list goes on and on...

And this ""fleet killer"" couldn't kill ONE ship.  That is not setting up a believable scenario, I mean if the rebels were that good why do they have such things as problems?

"I found the Johnson's comment about Snoke not being important to Rey insightful?  Why do we care about this when we didn't care about the Emperor's identity in the original trilogy?  The prequels went into this and showed him to be a mastermind, fooling and subverting the Jedi at every turn.  So now we had this expectation that somehow who Snoke was was important, but this was not a question that the Force Awakens imposed.  There is a story to his rise but it is not important to The Last Jedi story.  Johnson's comment applies to the other questions as well.

The reason we expected the lightsaber being handed to Luke to be important is that Rey thought it was important.  And our confusion/disappointment/contempt for Luke throwing it away help us relate to how Rey is feeling.

We cared about who Rey's parents were because she did.  She held it to such importance that she wanted to get back to Jakku through most of the Forth Awakens.  We are disappointed by them not being anything important helps us relate to how Rey is feeling.",0.8613,201

"I like your panel, but many of you are missing the point. A sequel (and let's get this clear that's all TLJ is at the end of the day) has some degree of commitment to consistency. This movie factually contradicts the previous movies, the ""adult subjects"" are superficially explored and feel very out of place (not to mention how they contradict the new Canon events of other movies and the TV shows) and the thing you seem to be missing the point the most on...Star Wars is first and foremost, a Fairy Tale, Lucas himself described as a space themed soap opera and others have correctly called it ""Modern Mythology"" the selective demystification Johnson did was very flacid, unsatisfying and when you go watch it a second time most of the countless subversions in the story seem to serve no other narrative purpose than being subversions (contrary to how subversions serve the plot ESB) Star Wars became phenomenal because it was timeless. TLJ feels like it's reacting as if they are aware of the internet and our world. The bad guys that started out as an Empire rip-off are turned into basically an overblown analogy for the Alt-Right (young guys fondling Nazi memorabilia etc. ) and in the end it's just very disappointing. This movie somehow managed to not only avoid fixing any of the TFA problems but destroy everything else along the way.

"It goes without saying that Dan was the only one speaking for fans and what (I feel) the main consensus have problems with [of the issues mentioned that is].

Roth did the best she could to stay impartial and did a good job hosting but the other three stooges....
From left to right:
Absolute ""drip"" of a human,
the werewolf from buffy the vampire slayer,
and the dude who's trying to ""look hip"" [and younger] with a cap (trying to hide the fact his nose is stuck up disneys....).

What contentious nonsense. An absolute farce of brown-nosing [from the left side of the panel] and just taking more time in this to blame theorists for the mistakes the franchise has made [in not answering questions it kicked up in the force awakens]. The most poignant point was raised at the end - ""there is seemingly no connection to the story telling of this trilogy"", and the [seemingly] carelessness in how the Star Wars Universe is being handled by this new owner [Disney].

Yes, its hard to be able to say two thirds of the way through it, but watching this it felt that the whole sentiment of the hardcore star wars fans (and Dan) - were attempted to be sidelined as just ""you didn't get what you want"", but the left side of the panel were incorrect - in that it's not that we didn't get what we *want* from the movies, it's that [I feel], we didn't get the *quality we expect* from a star wars movie storyline.

The divisive issue is - do fans like the direction that Disney are taking the Star Wars universe?
This is the divisive issue at hand, which the left of the panel didn't show any thought or understanding of as their heads were stuck elsewhere......

""They have a plan"" Hip-fandango states... yet - when they've gone through multiple directors and re-shoots for some of these recent/upcoming films, and as Dan stated - released/sold the story alarmingly later than what you'd expect, it would seem that there isn't as much of a plan or care put into one - or more that there is a growing lack of confidence from fans, that, they have a quality plan, as there are many who care about these characters and this fanatical universe.

For me, I like to try and break it down like this:
Imagine the original star wars movies, to be that of statues - historical memories portrayed by certain shapes [characteristics] which tell's a story. Now also imagine that, Lucas film were a business that owned the land that the statue's were rooted upon. Well, Lucas film, who [for simplistic sake] nurtured the statues and their stories, have now sold the land to another company - Disney, but Disney don't quite know how to handle these statues or landscape, and don't seem to be handling them with much care - with regard to the history or the story of the statue - or even how it looks. As they *are* new owners, they will have to show that there is something new about these statues and so they're going to change how they look (putting their own creative stamp on it) and going to update their stories [ultimately changing the history of the statue]...... I hope this makes sense, and explains how and or why there is a consensus of people who are unhappy.

But, you can't please everyone all the time as they say. In business, they'd tell you not to ignore your USP, but I think in the business side of things, Disney have followed it bureaucratically not passionately, which is the underlying issue.
Also, I could be talking complete nonsense myself! Leave your thoughts.

P.s. No mention of the needless ""romance story"" of Rose and Finn? How it just wasted time, just like the Pod-Racing in previous Star Wars? Or just not a divisive issue more of a plot issue?",-0.9672,770

"Pt2.. The right degree.. subversion is fine, you can even stretch it, to an extent.. But you must then offer something in the subverted's place, preferably something even better or else why bother.. The substitutes should also all be parts of the same whole and cover any and all potholes encountered along every side street from where you steer onto and down the new avenue.. The change of course beginning with the elimination of Snoke was drastic, a key turning pont that was not navigated correctly, and dare I add to saying a major waste of both character and plot potential also a self defeating insult to a great actor.. It was, as executed, nonsensical. Many arguments are made defending this decision such as the mythos' revolouton but, look, an emperor type must, will always exist if not by that name then in one guise or another.. The archetype mastermind archvillain is prerequisite, so therefore ""Oh no, not the obligatory emperor.. in the shadows.. again?"" is actually no defense when viewed from above rather by nature the more stereotypycal of the two from an argumentative context.. For just as in our reality that's exactly what he is, nearly invisibly pulling all the strings from the farthest corners. 
Here I believe that Rian ran astray, falling victim to what happned in to the script for The Defenders with Alexandra's mega build having amounted to nothing and following nearly the exact same pattern being killed by her cherished ultimate weapon Elektra out of fury when discovering her manipulation but then, curiously, turning around and taking the reins of the same evil organisation fully into her own hands.. sound familiar?. This direction rendered BOTH Alexexandra (again an even greater actress) and by symptosy Elektra two mere big red herrings.. Additionally in TLJ not only is it Kylo who's affected but more importantly and even moreso, Rey. 
Yes, I'm afraid it's true that this was one of the major contributors to her role being variously labled Mary Sue and such, and after hearing Miss Roth reciting Rian's response to the Snoke dillema, I am rethinking the wisdom of some of his moves for, it mattering not who Snoke is to Rey is simply shortsightedness and furthermore so when factoring in that it matter's even more to the audience.. For how this ties in we must do a Pt2.. But before I do..

I did not think it necessary to state the obvious but will do say so know that I fall in with the logical view in that I sympathize with both sides of the fanbase, those loving and also those displeased with TLJ.. I loved much of it but also feel that there were enough missed opportunities.. Still we must respect others' opinions.",-0.779,512

It's not that Rian Johnson wanted to try something different, it's that he casually gave us the middle finger with how he did it.  I just didn't think it was a good movie.  The humor didn't hit properly, the plot seemed like a waste of time, and Rey isn't hitting home with me.  She just doesn't have any struggle to make her a compelling character.  The three guys on the left, and many of the movie's defenders, just don't get it.  The only reason anyone wonders about Rey's lineage is because TFA presents the question.  I actually would've preferred Rey to be presented as someone completely new from the outset.  To that point, not everyone in Star Wars has to be a Skywalker or Solo.  The Jedi Order was filled with people from random backgrounds.  It just so happens that the first six episodes are centered on Anakin and Luke.  They are the main characters.

Snoke is established to be the leader of the First Order (which is never delved into) AND he is the one that turned Ben Solo to the dark side (which is also never delved into). We never learn how he attained his position of power, what his beef is, why he wanted to turn Ben to the dark side, or how. Then he's killed off. You see, it's not about Snoke and Snoke alone. It's about how him and his motivations factor into the narrative as a whole. Without these essential pieces of information, many viewers have no emotional anchor to invest in the crux of the conflict. Snoke ties into Ben ties into Luke. Snoke also ties into the greater galactic conflict. Now, he's gone without a single answer.

It starts with kylo , a brief moment with mom and dad and the scene him dropped off at lukes academy. Luke senses his power and the darkness, but doesnt sense snoke. He doesnt realize he himself is under mental attack from snoke ( this is in general details could be changed ) this leads to Luke failing in that one moment.  Then we meet snoke , he is revealed to be behind this via his immense power. As he is talking he looks to his side , he senses something.  Now we see ray. Her opening scenes...... This is a rough outline but you see where I'm going it gives us the details we want  to actually care about these people. Coukd even have short scene with Yoda telling him about ssnoke who  knows.  don't just say yeah luke turned fir a second   I'm not a hater.  After seeing the last Jedi I don't really care what happens now. There's nothing there , at least for me. ... Sorry this is so long if someone reads this. My last tiny gripe. You guys were taking about grey hero's and lineage .. we already know you don't have to be a Skywalker to be a Jedi , we saw the prequals so that lesson isn't something that needed to be learned. This is the 9 part story of the Skywalker story. (do we really need to crazily mix it up to make a point in this 9 part series right at the end when you can go off on your own for the next billion years making these movies ?) does star wars need to reflect us as a people ? Why can it not just be a great plot from a galaxy far far away. Why does it have to represent us and our ideas as a race ?  I don't know. I sound like I'm shouting here I'm not lol  I get emotional when I watch Luke face Vader to this very day. I can't see that happening in episode 9. I feel they traded heart for suprise.",-0.9731,443
"This is not update this was satire type jab at fans. Let the past die. kill it if you have too.  Why?  Why not have the past pass the torch.  Which the alst scene of TFA was trying to do.  Continuity builds a saga and a trilogy. Even the actors don't know their motivations in this film.  It was undermined purposely by Johnson for shock value and to attempt to further distance himself from the shadow of the OT by downplaying the main characters.  They were left out of ideas so they decide to make the cantina scene and an 18-hour space chase in slow-mo.  this movie disjointed itself and fragmented the lore the mythology and doomed itself in the third installment by sake of the arcs of these characters and thereby, challenges, why we, the audience should be invested to stay on this journey.  Rpgue One is the best version of the new SW movie",-0.9231,172

"Totally agree with Dan's view of you can make decisions but its not the WHAT but rather the HOW of what was done. Can someone also please tell me why JJ just skipped writing and directing duties on this. It is arguably the largest franchise in the world, you do the first one, and do a fantastic job at making people believe in the  Star Wars galaxy again and then do not do the next one. What? Is there something else better you need to be doing right now?

And that Hal Rudnick can just piss off form this (half) round-table discussion as he clearly is adding no value and it seems everyone feels the same",0.8874,125

"What I love about TFA is that I can take my child to see it without being scared by the bad guys.

With the original trilogy, she had a hard time watching because Vader and emperor etc. were scary to her.

Now with TLJ she thinks Kylo is cute and thought Hux was really funny and goofy.  And now with the scary man (Snoke) beat so easily by the pretty boy, she can enjoy now cause all the scary bad men are gone and she doesn't ever have to be scared again and can just enjoy a good movie.",0.934,108

"Wow, did this video cause me to lose a lot of respect for the panelists.  Every time one of them came close to echoing the concerns of MANY fans, one could visibly see the others get nervous.  Why would you be afraid to take a definite stand?  You say, ""I can see how X could be a problem"", and then instantly back away.  No one is saying TFA was a 'rehash' of old things, they said it was a 'copy'.  So you're point that 'now they get something new and they complain' is invalid and spurious.  Yikes you guys!",0.2003,119
"Wow, this is a sample of the big picture. While I certainly respect/promote the freedom to have differing opinions, Dan seems to really know what he is talking about and he is the most passionate. The young lady to his left also appears to be very honest about what the movie is and then like a spectrum everyone is grasping the problem more and more incorrectly. This movie undercut the characters and message of the original and did so at times mockingly (or at least that is how it felt) and that pissed a lot of fans off (rightfully so). It is not the film's superficial diversity (which is unfortunately used as a shield against criticism), it is the underlying philosophy. The actors playing Rose, Finn, and Poe do a wonderful job but their stories in this movie are also underwhelming and regressive. The other members of the panel here have presented a false dilemma:  you can't win with a star wars movie, it is either too original or too unoriginal. For people claiming to love ambiguity and moral uncertainty (which could be an interesting way to take the movies -- and I will come back to that), they strangely can't appreciate one of Dan's main points which is that you can be original and unexpected and compliment/complement the original story/characters. This takes thought. It would have been creative to have Rey join Kylo (or the other way around) and destroy both the first order and the resistance. Or Kylo could have been Snoke (these also may not be great ideas / they need open criticism) . Such critical/creative thought was lacking (Rian Johnson did not appear to listen at all to Hamill's complaints). He wanted to do his own thing and the story had to still  be simple enough for what they perceive to be a dumb mass audience. People in power have to stop seeing the average person as an idiot who needs a professional critic to tell her or him what to think. You want to have a movie that gets into moral ambiguity etc... then challenge your own moral certainty about issues such as animal rights, child workers/slaves etc... I think we can all imagine the response if that discussion was taken to its logical conclusion (practically everyone deep down thinks of morality in terms of black and white; you just have to find their issue). Personally I would prefer this universe to focus on deeper things (that will be meaningful generation after generation) and not resemble America's current political/social battles.  While destruction may breed creation, it also certainly causes a lot of grief (unnecessarily). Destruction is not the only way to create and or develop new things. You don't have to rid a culture of its past to have it join the modern world.",-0.9108,533
"Yea i agree with Dan, they didnt plan the films' arc so each writter/director is just making shit up as they go along.
