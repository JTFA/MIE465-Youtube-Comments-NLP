"Most people in south America don't drink 'real' coffee. They make the beans, and then it's exported. And then we see it in our european supermarkets. Normal people there drink just shitty nescafe coffee sticks and drink nestle powdered milk. It's what I experienced when I was there. Seeing the beautiful coffee plants, broke my heart. This looks like greenwashing to me. Correct me when I'm wrong. This whole topic just makes me so sad. I'm sorry.",-0.8424,91
