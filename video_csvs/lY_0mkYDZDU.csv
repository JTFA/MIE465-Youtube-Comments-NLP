"Wanna lyrics? Here you are!


Yeah, it's over, it's over
I'm circling these vultures
Got me praying and it's hunger
Feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you
Said ""what's up?"" and push right thru
Then I tried to catch you
But we're always on the move
And now it's over, we're sober
Sympthoms of the culture
And the night ain't getting younger
Last call's around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted
And I'm pouring out the truth
Just fading out this talk
Is 'cuz now all I want is you
I'm saying

Come over here, sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word, and I'll part the sea
Just come over here, sit next to me
And I'll take you high, high

Well, I ain't frontin' my intention
Got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention
Got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you
Said ""do you wanna keep the light?""
But I'm here to tell you
I'm not trying to change your mind
It's alright, ooh
It's alright, ooh
Ey

Come over here, sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word, and I'll part the sea
Just come over here, sit next to me, o-ooh
And I'll take you high, high, high, high

It's alright
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Yeah, it's alright

So come over here, sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word, and I'll part the sea
Just come over here, sit next to me

It's alright ...",0.9278,301

Atravez de que la gente te acepté por lo que públicas, o creando una imagen falsa de lo que aparentas ser!!...( porque la realidad de las redes sociales es que creamos un perfil superficial para nuestro publico tipo lo mejor de nosotros, lo que le guste a la gente o consiga mas likes, algo vacío que con el paso del tiempo se vuelve superficial y metódico)... Dios lo que esta escrito aqui...va más haya!!!...pero no cualquiera lo entiende!!...bueno al menos yo lo entendí de esta manera, y puedo entender que es creativo y esta dentro de lo nuevo que se utiliza en la actualidad en los vídeos!!...pero te distrae!!!...pones más atención en que sucede en el vídeo que en la letra!!!...y lo que sea de cada quien la letra es buena...pero si no hubiera escuchado solo el audio...seguiría perdida y no apreciaría la letra!!!...bueno es solo mi punto de vista!!...tomalo constructivamente!!!...",-0.7599,320
