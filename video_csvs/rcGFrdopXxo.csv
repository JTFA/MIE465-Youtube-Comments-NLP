Almost as bad as what coke tried to do with their NEW COKE disaster. And why, so they could replace wholesome natural ingredients with artificial industrial carcinogens. Think about how for over a half a century they pedaled diet soda as the better choice. Then the Sheeple discovered how it had only been making them fatter, and giving them cancer.
