Their music was filled with various messages and meaning, good vocals, amazing melodies and sounds. Swift's music can be basic or pretty good.

I earned my place in several professional organizations, including NARAS...while Michael Green & Pierre Cassett were still in charge of the classier version of the LIVE Grammy televised broadcast. A voting member in good standing for 21+yrs & consistent w/my music & recording skills, & my involvement w/Grammy Advocacy....til ""JaLynn"" in your membership dept. revoked my membership w/out any reason at all; even after I released my 7th, critically acclaimed album titled ""Nocturnal Moves"" & a new single on time for consideration for this years' Grammys. Considering the fact that most of the votes & Grammys went to men, one can only deduce that mine & perhaps other very strong female Artists' rightful memberships were revoked, delayed or suspended to strengthen the chances of male artists to ""win"". So, when you claim that you & other male artists ""welcome"" female Artists, you are out-right LYING, & I refuse to stand for it any longer. Further, having been a recording artist since the age of 14....I know full well what it means when a male musician tells a female Artist to ""step up"" IF they want to ""get something"".

I think you'll find that the objective answer, when comparing the two, was obviously Bruno's album. I find diversity a bit sickening. It's a horrible business practice, not to mention racist in it of its self.

"I definitely appreciate you taking the time to address an issue this important — and yes, I would say you hit the nail on the head with the problems with Ehrlich's comments and the Grammy's in general. However, your own top 50 albums and singles of the year staggeringly prefer male to female artists (I'm pretty sure the AOTY ratio was something like 45:5 male to female). This is not to say that you are sexist, etc, but rather that maybe your comments on Ehrlich's statement could be more nuanced if you took a hard look at your history and maybe think deeper about why male musicians are so vastly preferred to female ones. Certainly numbers/availability have something to do with it but more likely there is an internalized hierarchy that everyone (including myself) need to be more vigilant about exposing and deconstructing?

Even artists like Bjork are constantly having their creativity attributed to her (mostly) male producers despite their protestations. Lorde gets offered a spot as a tribute to an old male artist (David Bowie fair enough their was some sort of connect) but Tom Petty, it seems like a case of 'we had better let a woman sing, well we could let her sing a tribute, not her own songs? Women want in to the industry and always have and without being bullied, shaped, molded and exploited by sleazy svengalis and record execs. The recorduing industry is reknowned for expoiting and ripping off all artists, so it's no surprise that extends even further to women. The sorry truth is that women have been disadvantaged and excluded by institutionalised male chauvinist attitudes in the music industry and i'm sure every single successful and unsuccessful female artist could tell at least one story that ilustrates this point.

"The grammys are pure trash. All of those stupid award shows are. Just a dick measuring contest. & a lot of it has to do with money. 

Anyway I'm a female producer and I know mostly female musicians.",-0.4939,43
The last time the Grammys were relevant was when good music and talent was still alive,0.8074,16
"The only comments i see here are just saying that the grammy's are a joke, and are just ignoring the wider issue that the video brings up. The issue isn't about the relevance of awards shows and their influence, but the involvement of women in the music industry. The Grammy's themselves, since they are selecting ""the best"" of the best, you only see a small amount of the music industry each year, limiting exposure to only 5 or 6 artists per category. The bigger issue is in the grass roots of the music industry, which is a harder issue to even analyse.",0.9366,114
"The point you make at 7:19 is why I'll never understand why people get so worked up over this shit. If all people want is confirmation that their favorite artists are more critically acclaimed than Bruno Mars, there are review aggregate sites they can go to for their yearly ego stroking. Of course Kendrick and SZA aren't going to appeal to a group of white people over 60. Even if every category next year goes to black and female artists, is that really going to make the Grammys any less shallow?",-0.2382,97
"The problem is that no matter what happens in an award ceremony or any other form of measurement, it's not going to be 100% equitable. There's always over and under-representation in every single group, so there's a neverending onslaught of accusations of bias against them based on the ""if it isn't exactly representative of the general population then someone is being discriminated against"" and the card is played so much it's hard to take it seriously anymore, even if there is truth to it. ""The Oscars are too white!"" ""Not enough women go into STEM!"" etcetera, when it usually boils down to people freely choosing not to go into fields because of preference, or simple chance. Even if there was a point within this argument it's so often voiced with so little room for nuance that there's no point in listening because entertaining the people voicing this position so loudly is like inviting a boa constrictor to play with your infant. I think his comments could have been made more eloquently, but I honestly am glad he responded the way he did. If you want in, then stop complaining and show people why you should be in, not berate others for not handing your self-identified group an arbitrary amount of awards because if we don't give them to you we'll be called sexist.

That said, the Grammys never were a good measure of the quality of the artist, they're a music industry circle jerk and the idea that people are putting this much stake in them in the first place is baffling.",0.8395,288
"The problem is the close-mindedness of the Grammy's in general. There were many good albums released by women last year and women-fronted bands, such as Bjork, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Chelsea Wolfe, and Slowdive. You know, women that actually write and perform their own music, unlike the manufactured pop stars that the Grammy's love to cater to.",0.6597,64
"The thing is, even if Bruno Mars didn’t win AOTY, Lorde still wouldn’t have won because it wasn’t the best. Let’s be honest, the Grammy’s are absolutely nothing but a popularity contest and have been for years. The fact that it’s so politicized now doesn’t help the case. I will agree that Lorde should’ve been offered a performance of some kind, but due to her refusing to play in Israel, they may have wanted to avoid controversy.",0.8891,102
"They aren't the best of the best. They are famous people to bring in viewers. It's a popularity contest brought on by the major labels. One of the rules is that only nominees can perform, but that rule was broken a few years ago when Lady Gaga performed and this year when a few artists performed that weren't nominated because they were famous artists.",-0.7556,69

"When an industry is dominated by males, it’s difficult for women to break into, even if they are just as talented or more talented. They can be stigmatized & patronized in the industry bc they’re women. Also they’d be discouraged bc it gives of the vibe of a “boys club”. Which makes them less likely to try bc they don’t feel welcomed or taken as seriously as their male counterparts.",0.4767,86

"Why is saying ""we have to be more inclusive"" a negative thing? I think making a conscious effort to say that women are welcome in the music industry is helping to create an environment of equality. It's not ""rolling out the red carpet"" for women. That's a very patronizing way to look at it. I don't think it's cool for you (a man) to mansplain those comments, that were clearly made in an effort to uplift the female music community, in such a negative light. We need people in powerful positions to recognize that the playing field must be equal in order for everyone to benefit.",0.6889,120
