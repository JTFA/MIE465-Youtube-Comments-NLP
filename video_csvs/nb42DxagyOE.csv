"""Aids rubbish""? Are you joking? If a film about two men who have sex with men in the late eighties doesn't have something in it about the AIDS crisis then it's literally erasing out history. Everyone lived in fear of AIDS then, and gay/bi men were told that they were going to get it, that having sex with other men was a ticking time bomb. Nobody's saying 'oh one of them is going to be hiv+', what we ARE saying is that that's something you can't ignore and just not include. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, they would be terrified. You can't make a film based in the late 30's in Germany and not include nazis, just like you can't make a film about two gay/bi men in the late eighties and not include HIV/AIDS.",-0.8847,162

Gay guys are so not disgusted by 'ball sacks' that they routinely hold them, kiss them, lick them, put them in their mouths... and yes,  love to see them from behind between a guy's legs.

"Tristen MT In fact for those who claim that 'Call Me By Your Name' fails to acknowledge AIDS because ""its two men who sleep with each other in the 80s, so you have to mention AIDS"" have obviously not read the book the movie is based on. For all of you, the book does address that, albeit discreetly. Before Elio and Oliver sleep with each other the first time, they both ask each other if they are 'well' or 'healthy' or something around those lines, implying that they know about the matter and before they take such a step, they want to ""know"" about each other. After they both confirm to each other that they are Ok, THEN they proceed. Given their realities I mentioned in my previous comment, the odds of them having the disease are anyway slim to none, if any. With that, the book explains that with that assuredness, Oliver and Elio have 'condomless', natural, skin to skin sex, as Elio is found himself expressing during the book that Oliver was ""inside him"" that night and even that Oliver 'came' inside him as well. Not that it wouldn't have been advisable for them to have protected sex anyway, but if they already knew they didn't have a chance of carrying the disease, going natural or bareback would not be such a farfetched idea.",0.7176,265
"Tristen MT It is rubbish in this particular context considering it has absolutely nothing to do with anything regarding the original story. And two bisexual men who are not promiscuous would not even be thinking ""omg I'm gonna get AIDS!"" Like, why would they get it? From WHO exactly? You must be the one ""joking"".",0.6882,65
"Tristen MT That's why Elio could later say, after also having had sex with the peach, 
""It reminded me that I had probably looked no different on his bed [Oliver's] last night after he’d come inside me the first time.""",-0.296,49
"Tristen MT This is taken from the book before Elio and Oliver sleep together:
Elio: ""I’d been meaning to ask the tactful health question, but that too seemed to have been answered a while ago, because when I finally did find the courage to ask him [Oliver], he replied, “I already told you, I’m okay.” 
Elio: “Did I tell you I was okay too?” Oliver: ""Yes.”",0.7684,91
"Tristen MT okay fair point, but why would a 17 year old boy and a religiously conservative 24 year old man have fear of AIDS if they had never slept with other men except each other? I mean another important fact you are missing is that, despite that it was the 80s and all the AIDS scare, guys still slept with each other regardless, protected and unprotected, in love or just for sex. In Oliver and Elio's story it still is believable that they would still fall in love and would want to have a physical relationship despite what was going in the world at the time. I mean, Im not saying that AIDS doesn't have to mentioned or acknowledged, but I don't see why'd it would have to be integral in this love story, especially taken into consideration the character's realities.",0.9239,154

why are the comments saying the interviewer was unprofessional and childish with the questions? this is actually my favorite interview just bc it was so funny. like how many times do we need to hear them answer the same generic questions? this guy switched it up and i think you could tell that both armie and timothée thought they were funny too!,0.856,66

"👿GiriGirl👿 Hopefully. At the very least as a Deleted Scene. I think what they showed when Elio did it the first time with Marzia could have easily been added when he did it with Oliver, and I don't think it would have ruined the movie. They just had to make it romantic (as opposed to when he did it with Marzia, which wasn't very romantic at all...)",0.7506,77
👿GiriGirl👿 I think it's safe to say Elio's cherry was already popped in this one 😂,0.4404,18

"👿GiriGirl👿 you and me both lol. Maybe we could get a more graphic cut for the DVD. But only for Elio and Oliver's scenes. If they amp up the scenes with Marzia, don't bother lol 😂",0.6437,42
