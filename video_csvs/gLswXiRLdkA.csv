"Amber....There isn't such thing as faux feathers. That jacket is made out ouf real feathers because fake feathers is really hard to make ""real"" looking so there isn't many products made of that.

Go on the app “wish” they have really cheap stuff on there I swear u will fall in love with it I buy from there like literally all the time yes it takes awhile to come in but it is worth it in my opinion I don’t like to buy clothes that are more than $20 I’m very cheap shopping so if u want to do a tutorial on someone who is really on a budget “wish”this is the way to go. Also can u do a tutorial on how to look fabulous and what clothes to wear when your a thick girl yes I know your really skinny but if you do the research I’m sure u will figure something out or use someone who’s thick :) i think that would be great to do clothes for skinny and thick girls please and thank you,0.9902,161

"Hi Amber! I adore you sososo much and I want to give you heads up because I know how much you care. But could you please stop wearing feathers as well?:( The feather industry is just as horrible and there are no such thing (unfortunately) as faux feathers or feathers that's been taken from the ground as the company often says. I used to think that feathers was okay to wear too but after some research i stopped purchasing feathers too :( my point is not to be mean or anything, I just wanted you to know..
