"This is like a poor adaption to the movie Shallow Hal, though Shallow Hal was actually funny. 

The reason why Shallow Hal works better than this is because Hal saw a people differently than how others did due to being hypnotized and the audience got to see what he saw (someone who had a  bad personality was  seen as unattractive and vs versa. Basically talking about inner beauty and thus got to really know people for who they are. Lets face it, Hal was no prize himself either but he did learn some valuable lessons while having a lot of humor thrown in). Where here, Amy just looks like herself. We don't see how her head injury truly alters how she sees herself, so it sort of loses it's affect. It just seems so awkward. 

Since this is a movie, I don't expect for it to have a good and healthy message about encouraging self improve (trying to make better/healthier choices) while working on confidence still and showing support to those struggling (you know, truly empowering people so they can feel better both inside and out); but it should of at least be entertaining.",0.9907,216

"Wow....Apparently, a lot of people hate this trailer! I think if they picked a different leading lady, this might have been an okay movie. Maybe they thought that women could ""relate"" to Amy. Why does Hollywood insist on over-promoting people that audiences clearly don't like? I get that Amy has connections and knows a lot of people in the entertainment industry but this DOESN'T mean she has the talent and presence to star in major movies or bring in record box office numbers. I think this is honestly too much of a role for her and I can think of several other performers who would have made this character a lot funnier.  
 
The more Amy gets shoved in our faces, the less people like her. Maybe it is time for Amy and her people to recognize that she had one hit movie, it was several years ago and movie audiences have changed. For whatever reason, Amy just is not a marketable act anymore. Netflix doesn't see this. The movie industry doesn't see this and they keep giving her work that is obviously too much for her to handle. You can see even in the trailer, she is just saying lines and not putting any real effort into becoming a character. She is basically just playing herself in the same tired role she played before. How is this acting?   
 
Amy might know the right people in Hollywood but she just doesn't have the talent or the looks to make it big. She is a weak stand up comedy performer and she just is not capable of bringing in big numbers in the box office, especially when dozens of other actresses could have taken on this role and done a much better job.
