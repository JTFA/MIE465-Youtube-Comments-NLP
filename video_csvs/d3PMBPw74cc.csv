What’s up with this? I’m a 62 years old Black woman and I don’t even recognize my race anymore. Between the blond hair, tons of weave and Liberal brainwashing,  Black people today are a clusterf**k. I have a condition called alopecia so I have NO hair and I rock it very well!  I have wigs but none of them are blond and those that mind don’t matter and those that matter don’t mind.  This is the same cultural appropriation that Black people and Latinos complain about with White people who DARE to wear a sombrero on Cinco de Mayo or dress their kid in the wrong Halloween costume! what’s wrong with your own hair or at least a wig or extensions in a color that looks natural.
