"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends!!!!
The signs are all here!!! Hallelujah! 

I pray that you take heed to this comment, because Jesus truly Loves you. He is not angry at you, those are just lies from the devil. 

Yeshua (Jesus' Hebrew Name) died and rose again for us, so that we may live! He gave us a new beginning by taking our punishment upon Himself. 

So please repent of your sins and put your faith in The Lord! He will save you! He is not expecting you to clean up yourself, HE will do it. He just wants you to come to Him in faith, because He will never force you to come. 
He also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him!!!

So please make this moment you call upon Jesus. No fancy prayer is necessary for salvation, just speak to Him from the heart. Tell Him how much you need Him, and how you have heard of the miracles He has done in many men and women. 

He will make a Way for you to escape the oncoming judgement, because He made a Way through His Body on the cross! Hallelujah!

Thank you, Jesus!

To die without Jesus is very dangerous, friends. Please be wise today! 

Shalom.",0.9745,257
