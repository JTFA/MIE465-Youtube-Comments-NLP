"cant wait,   in illinois they built extra rail for their fake high speed train that can only go high speed for about 20 miles.  they lie to the people then later demand billions more in support every year from the state,   they claim they cant operate with out the yearly bail outs.   and i have been on Amtrack going to chicago and every 15 minuted they had to stop the train and jump out to look at one of the wheels because it was flying apart with cracks in it and shaking the train.  but they chose to keep going from St. Louis to chicago with a wheel they knew was cracking in half.  they put all peoples lives in danger,  this was shortly before the amtrack train driver fell asleep and rammed the train right up into the union station to the end of the line.  amtrack must always stop for cargo trains because they have right of way.   even with the extra rail in illinois the high speed train is a joke.  its not being done for making a faster train for passengers,   its for moving freight cars",-0.7821,202
