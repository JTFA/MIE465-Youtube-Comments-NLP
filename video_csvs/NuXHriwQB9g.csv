"RP-1 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP-1  For anyone interested more technically this is a very interesting read.  I knew the basics but found this quite enlightening.  My initial statement was simply to say it is very cool that this pad is being used again for a huge rocket and that last time, other than the previous Falcon 9 launches, that kerosene was used on this scale of rocket was with the Saturns and the last flight off 39A was the Saturn 5 Skylab lab launch.  The Saturn 1Bs flew off of 39B. A large number of past and current rockets use RP-1.  I also apologize for becoming a bit irate with another poster who apparently was removed or removed himself from the thread.  When I posted simply ""kerosene"" at the top I knew it was highly refined kerosene in the form of RP-1.",0.8995,156

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

Например: ""НЕДЕЛИН, Митрофан, Главный маршал артиллерии, участник войны в Испании, советско-финской войны..., 1-ый главком РВСН... Погиб 24 октября 1960 года на 41 стартовой площадке Байконура при взрыве ракеты Р-16 на испытаниях. Всего погибло 74 человека и ещё четверо умерло в результате сильных ожогов и отравления парами гептила. Температура горения была столь высока, что, по свидетельству бывшего начальника космодрома Александра Курушина, от маршала Неделина остался только тёмный след на асфальте возле ракеты. Были найдены оплавившаяся Золотая звезда Героя Советского Союза, один его погон и наручные часы. Своей гибели маршал мог бы избежать, если бы воспользовался специальным укрытием, а не сидел на стуле возле ракеты при подготовке её к запуску. Такая беспечность стоила ему жизни. Инцидент был строго засекречен, официально было объявлено о гибели только самого Неделина в результате авиакатастрофы. Останки маршала Неделина были захоронены в некрополе Кремлёвской стены на Красной площади в Москве...""",0.0,200
