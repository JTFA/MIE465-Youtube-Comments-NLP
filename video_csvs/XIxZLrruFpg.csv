"I'm new here so I honestly do not know.... is Julia related to Alanis Morrisette?  I am taken aback by her similarity.... She's beautiful of course, and I love the channel and have no idea how I haven't found it before, so I'm curious.  A cooking channel with interesting things to cook mixed with jokes that don't aim to be as kid-friendly as possible turning it into a milquetoast blandfest?  I didn't know I needed this in my life but I so do.  I'll take a channel like this with actual human beings over the Utah-droids any day.",0.9124,107
