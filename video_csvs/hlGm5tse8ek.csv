We all know Russia has always spied..as have we..and everyone else with the wherewithal to do it.

Mueller is a compromised  Clintonian tool.. who after being rejected for FBI Director thought he could save his BFF Comey.

Convoluted Witch Hunt.  Comey is criminal and by extension now..so is Mueller...who delivered Uranium to Russia himself.

--We regret that the April visit by Director Mueller could 
not take place due to a scheduling conflict.  We would be 
grateful once again for the Russian Federation's willingness 
to receive the sample and facilitate the logistics for its 
pick up. 
 
--As before, we require confirmation that a representative 
from a responsible Russian law enforcement authority will be 
available to accept custody of the sample and have signatory 
authority to accept the sample. 
 
--We require that the transfer of this material be conducted 
at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival 
of the Director's aircraft. 
  
6.  (S/Rel Russia) Action request: Embassy Moscow is 
requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the 
Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver 
the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21. 
Post is requested to convey information in paragraph 5 with 
regard to chain of custody, and to request details on Russian 
Federation's plan for picking up the material. Embassy is 
also requested to reconfirm the April 16 understanding from 
the FSB verbally that we will have no problem with the 
Russian Ministry of Aviation concerning Mueller's September 
21 flight clearance. 
 
7.  (S/Rel Russia) Post is requested to deliver the following 
talking points: 
 
--We wish to inform you that FBI Director Mueller plans to 
arrive in Moscow on the evening of September 21 with a 
ten-gram sample of seized HEU, which you requested for 
nuclear forensics analysis.

 Mueller Indictment Consider what's quoted in the indictment as the goals of these Russians: ""The Organization's stated goal was ""spread(ing) distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general."" Specialists were directed to create ""politician intensity through supporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with (the) social and economic situation and opposition social movements."" The Organization controlled Facebook pages that ""addressed a range of issues, including immigration (with group names including ""Secured Borders""); the Black Lives Matter movement (with group names including ""Blacktivist""); religion (with group names including ""United Muslims of America"" and ""Army of Jesus""); and certain geographic regions. In June 2016, the Russians used the Facebook group ""United Muslims of America"" to promote a rally called ""Support Hillary. Save American Muslims."" Although not in the indictment itself, it's already been reported that in May 2016, two Russian-backed groups ‚Äî ""Heart of Texas"" and ""United Muslims of America"" ‚Äî organized both pro- and anti-Muslim rallies outside an Islamic center in Houston, where the two rallies squared off. Notice what's missing here? Any mention of electing Trump president.

By the way these 13 people are on indictable he took an old New York Times article and dusted It Off
November, former¬†GEC¬†director¬†Michael Lumpkin¬†described how the Global Engagement Center was using the data it received as a Facebook advertiser to¬†maximize the effectiveness of its own targeted¬†appeals.

‚ÄúUsing Facebook ads, I can go within Facebook, I can go grab an audience, I can pick Country X, I need age group 13 to 34, I need people who have liked ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi or any other set ‚Äì I can shoot and hit them directly with messaging,‚Äù Lumpkin said. He emphasized that with the right data, effective message targeting could be done for ‚Äúpennies a¬†click.‚Äù

¬†

Facebook can‚Äôt sell personally identifiable information directly to advertisers. But ad buyers can use the vast amount of data Facebook collects on its users to target their ads extremely precisely. Recent¬†research¬†from Christoph Aymanns, Jakob Foerster, and Co-Pierre Georg shows that a troll farm or influence operator ‚Äî they call such actors ‚Äúadversaries‚Äù ‚Äî can use just a small amount of personal information about a person‚Äôs belief system and their social structure to greatly increase the likelihood that an individual will accept what they are being¬†told.

As Aymann‚Äôs, Foerster‚Äôs and Georg‚Äôs work shows, an ad-buyer can easily use that sort of precision to target messages to individuals more likely to believe¬†them.

In his talk at the¬†Defense One¬†Summit, Lumpkin said that more information for better targeting was key to the Global Engagement Center‚Äôs endeavors. ‚ÄúIf I had more ability to work with that [personally identifiable information] and had access‚Ä¶I could do more targeting, more definitively, to make sure I could hit the right message to the right audience at the right¬†time‚Äù, Lumpkin was quoted as saying.

The 2017¬†NDAA¬†allows the¬†GEC¬†some leeway around privacy restrictions, so long as there is clear oversight in place in how the GEC uses the personal information that it obtains. The law also specifies what the¬†GEC¬†can do with that personal information ‚Äî it can, for example, use it to improve targeted campaigns and research the data analysis of foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts and communications related to public diplomacy efforts.

The True Russian Election Meddlers ‚Äì The Global Engagement Center

When Obama established the Global Engagement Center (GEC), the Anonymous Patriots called it the Ministry of Truth because we knew it would be used to spread lies. Around $60 million was spent during 2016 to completely monitor, target, and attack ‚Äúforeign state and non-state propaganda‚Äù, especially propaganda coming from Russia.

In actual fact, the GEC created propaganda exactly like the ‚ÄúRussian Meddling‚Äù that Mueller‚Äôs indictment references. The GEC was Hillary‚Äôs propaganda machine with all the power of the NSA, DoD, BBG, CIA, and all the cyberwarfare tools described in the Vault 7 Wikileaks.

The GEC did exactly the opposite of what it was supposed to do and in the end, Mueller blamed the GEC work on 13 Russian trolls.
