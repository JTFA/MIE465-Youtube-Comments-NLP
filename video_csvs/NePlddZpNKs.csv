"There's a reason Disney is the success it is.. They knew the ramifications of placing Trump in the Hall of Presidents... However, they also survived as long as they have and as financially sound because they don't choose sides... They find solutions. They did a good or the best job they could to avoid such potentially disruptive acts like for instance the intro with claim to Walts great respect for the country and to honor all presidents while keeping the speech very neutral... And they did the right thing by not simply closing the attraction which would of certainly avoided situations like this or kept it under renovation for 2 years... Instead they like we should all do when we have a problem.. Whether a person, place or thing..... We find solutions. For anything less is a failure of an individual or a business.... Just like that person yelling. He has a problem.... No solution.... In fact... The only person locked up was himself... And Disney being self governed.... I wouldn't doubt he spends quite some time in prison while possibly receiving treatment worse than he imagined as Disney is quite the contributer to Orange county and central Florida and what he did was intentional for attention with no respect for the situation he could of placed innocent children in should a full out brawl occurred. I tip my hat to both supporters of Trump and those who are against for staying out of such a despicable act... It showed great restraint and likely prevented a very dangerous environment for the families in that auditorium.... Just as much as Disney really deserves a pat on the back for their handling of this person without exacerbating the situation while ensuring the swift removal and prosecution for such a selfish act. There is a reason Disney is the happiest place on earth (well happier than most any other place at least).... And it comes down to something we can all learn a lesson from... Finding solutions....

I just want to know why do you guys still believe in trickle-down economics? Why do you guys still believe in an economic plan from the 1920's? Times have changed.
