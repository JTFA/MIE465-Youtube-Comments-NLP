"The ""raw metal"" contact won't really affect it's compatibility with water. 
The reason a device, such as a phone is damaged by water is because the water contacts the circuit board, and since, normal, electrolyte dense water is conductive, it starts sending the wrong signals to the wrong places, This is what ultimately damages the components, since before the presence of water, the wiring only went in one direction, but is now connected to the wrong places. This causes a build up of electric power and some important components may get damaged, depending on multiple factors such as exposure time, whether there was any charge passing through the device (you can't water damage something like a usb stick because it has no power going through it most of the time, so it can't short circuit if you just dry the USB before use, and it's also a very simple circuit,with little power draw, so there is a very slim chance that the components will ever be damaged by water) or the concentrations of conductive electrolytes in solution with the water.

So the reason that a phone is more easily water damaged than a phone is because the phone has much more wiring that can damage the device if the signals are sent elsewhere, than a mug which just has two contact points. The worst some water can do is close the circuit between the two contact points and drain the battery extremely slowly, unless the water penetrates deep enough to the more advanced components,such as the wireless transmitter used to update the temperature in the mug, or the lithium ion battery that I hypothesize is inside the mug. But even then, the circuit will like be open most of the time, so no power is being transferred, thus the components are almost certain to last. Even in the worst case scenario that the water completely closes the circuit, the battery likely won't be able to transfer enough power to the circuit to damage it in any way.

So essentially (and tl:dr), the mug will very likely never be damaged, as long you just don't connect it to a mains socket whilst dishwashing
