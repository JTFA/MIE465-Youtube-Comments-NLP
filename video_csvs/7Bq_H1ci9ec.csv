"Hoping to get your money, Mass Mutual just exploited the homeless, bullied children, shunned and lonely teens, Muslim victims of hate crimes, impoverished veterans, and the thousands of families whose homes and communities were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. And it worked. Social media is full of “I cried” and “brought tears to my eyes” posts. You can imagine the ad agency’s pitch. “Modern Americas like ads that make them feel warm and fuzzy, are obsessed with the tragic stories of victims of all kinds, and demand to see different races and ages getting along happily.”  Well kudos, MassMutual. While your utter crassness nauseated and appalled a few of us, you tapped into the current crop of Americans by pushing all the right buttons. And you made it look easy.",-0.9477,155
