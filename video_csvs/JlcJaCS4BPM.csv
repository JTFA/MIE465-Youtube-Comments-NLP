"Wow, that was a powerful segment. Breathtakingly poignant.
The last voice at the timeline intro (I think it was Megyn) said she had never expected this moment to come in time for her, but for her daughter.
I had grown up watching the Women's Liberation Movement active in the 1960s-70s. I honestly thought this remedied the oppression of women. I was painfully mistaken.
I also watched my mother struggle to be taken seriously in her profession and how my father put her down & was dismissive of her. He could ramble on at the dinner table about his job, yet Mom was shushed.
I knew how wrong such treatment was fundamentally wrong, and based on something so irrelevant as gender appearance.
Sadly, as soon as I began my career in 1976, sexual assault in workplace by colleagues began immediately.
I was repeatedly told I'd be blacklisted if I ever reported the harm perpetrated against me. I saw predators not only being protected, but actually promoted; like wth?
I also experienced personally, and witnessed others such as my loved ones, being submerged under the glass ceiling.
BTW, female predators are just as present; it is not just a male criminal behavior.

I had no idea I'd be waiting for over 40 years for this speaking up to commence. No more #MeToo, because all good people have risen up and are not taking the abuse anymore.
