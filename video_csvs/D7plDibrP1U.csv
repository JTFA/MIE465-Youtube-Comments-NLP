I remember in Europe meeting two terrorists. The worked for the US Army. They told me for 6 months of 2 terrorist events that had been arranged and guaranteed to happen. I was incredulous until the two events happened exactly as they had said in detail, killing 104 people and injuring 270. I contacted the FBI. They did nothing I know of. I found out in detail about the attacks of 9-11 in 1997. Over four years and to and through the night of September 10, 2001 I had told about 130 people, including authorities in law enforcement. What did they do? Nothing I know of. I doubt they will help you. Violence, crime, and social disorganization are job security for government and police. This mess allows them to aggrandize their bases of power. They feed on it. You, the people, are the eternal victims.",-0.9878,280

"US gov can lie to US citizens, the gov can use Propaganda on US citizens. Legally. 

It's called: 

Smith Mundt Reauthorization Act 2012 and is in NDAA. 

Smith Mundt Act 2012 
allows the US gov to make fake news & tell us it's real news > PROPAGANDA 

The US gov can legally show us a WagTheDog Movie as NEWS.

The US Attorney General (US AG)  must become a PERMANENT citizen of INTERPOL. 

US AG must  give up US citizenship, become a citizen of INTERPOL & follow the constitution of INTERPOL NOT US constitution. 

The US AG works for INTERPOL; a foreign government. And US AG must sign & have a form called FARA Foreign Actor Registration Act  on file.
