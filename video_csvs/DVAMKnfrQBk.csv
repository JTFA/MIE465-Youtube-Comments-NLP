"*There are pedophiles EVERYWHERE. Your child cannot escape them. Pedophiles are VIRUSES. And many times, pedophiles are not what you would expect them to be -- many times, pedophiles are actually people you would put your trust in. THAT is what makes pedos so dangerous. They are like poisonous snakes melting into the background -- you don't know they're there. Nassar was a DOCTOR and he abused his position of trust over a 30-year period. But there is another pedo who got away Scot-free after raping two white schoolboys in Texas about two decades ago. This pedo is an Indian-American (originally born in India but now a naturalized American citizen) who had lived in the USA for nearly 25 years. He has a depraved attraction for young white boys. He moved back to his native India some years ago, but since he is an American citizen, he can come in and out of the USA at will and that is what makes this individual so very dangerous to young, white American boys. White America, if you want to keep your boys safe from the clutches of a homosexual predatory pedophile, check out **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAaaSbXieXw** and show them the face of evil that you must hope they will never encounter.*",-0.6748,237

"Horror Readings by G.M. Danielson 
When you are abused it's hard to believe what is happening is real. The grooming he did was a lot like brainwashing. Many of the girls were threatened and nearly kicked out of the Olympics if they didn't work with him. An innocent might isn't as strong as a broken one. If you've been hurt there's more anger towards those who try to hurt you. These were young girls 12-16 at the time abuse started. Imagine having to be brave enough to even tell someone that an adult is doing something wrong then imagine telling on said adult and being threatened. The real anger should be this has been happening since the 90's with multiple reports on this man. Why was he allowed to continue? The system failed these girls",-0.9904,149

And not everyone wants people to know they were a victim of something so heinous. Years later they may feel okay to share with the world the truth. Everyone is different. However, I would hope that from this movement there becomes a shift because I think even for the criminals everything would be a lot cleaner a fairer.

"talk about the ultimate contradiction. Megyn Kelly playing the here .. This is the same person that so disgustingly provided ""cover"" in an interview with James Alefantis.. Pick a lane Megyn.. oh wait. A Press ti tute picks any lane thats beneficial to themselves not society as a whole.  So riddle me this all. .. While of course we despise this despicable act, can anyone answer why the Spaceys . and Weinsteins still free? Seems to me if Nassar had hired some Mossad to do some talkin to his marks, things might have been different. .  I guess its the Justice system. Laws are for Just us. .. Not for them . Words cant describe how much i and all out there admire Aly. Courage. An understatement here .",0.8079,142
