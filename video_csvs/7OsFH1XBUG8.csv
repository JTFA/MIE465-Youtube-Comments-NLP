"A tiny amount of research would have revealed it's gasoline vapour that's flammable. To get whoosh bang needs a mix of vapour and oxygen at the correct ratio. Which is why gas tanks do not usually go boom, as seen all too often in films. Somewhere in the 7-15% full range contains enough mixed vapour and atmospheric oxygen to go boom. It's a surprisingly difficult phenomenon to achieve. So keep your tanks topped up folks!",-0.1511,83

"Anyone know why the fuse didn't burn in gasoline?   Fuses burn underwater so what's different about gasoline that put the fuse out?   Don't the fuses have their own propellant and oxidizer built in?   My theory is that since oxygen will itself combust, when the fuse is burning the gasoline it uses up the oxidizer in the fuse to burn, hogging oxygen from the rest of the propellant in the fuse (and thus putting it out).   One way to test this would be to paint the fuse in superglue and see if it still burns inside the gasoline when the gas can't reach the fuse.",-0.1566,113
