This episode also did not show to the audience what veronica's parent's sensitive secrets are behind their shady business to own pop's diner and a piece of riverdale land.

I feel like the kiss between Archie and Betty was more of a rebound for both of them. Since episode 1 all that Betty wants is to help/please other people and she wants to be needed. When she tried to join to serpents to keep an eye on Jughead it backlashed and now she‚Äôs feeling like a part of her is broken. When Archie said: Right now i NEED you Betty‚Äô she immediately kissed him as if she needed to hear those words to feel better again. I don‚Äôt think this necessarily has something to do with her feelings towards Archie. I mean even the @RiverdaleWritersRoom posted GIF‚Äôs about the Barchie moment on Twitter as if they hated it as well (look it up) and now even KJ says Bughead fans have nothing to worry about.

As you said, it all happened just in 4 months, I think that all the love that Betty feels for Archie is still there, she didn't get over this queekly.

"THEORY: Alice Cooper and FP DATED I AGREE WITH YOU LEANNE THEY DID HAVE HISTORY! So my theory is that Alice and FP used to date back when Alice used to be Serpent. Ok stating the obvious here but stay with me. Note how in episode eight of season two FP said to Alice in Pops to anti-quote ""LEAVE HIM....at home"" meaning to leave her husband HAL (whom could be the Black hood?) Which could possibly mean she had a somewhat complicated history with FP, possibly telling Alice to leave her husband back before she had Betty. IDK if it was before Polly though. Ok I'm not finished bare with me, So in one past episode of #SweetwaterSecrets Leanne said that there would be more incest (confirmed by a cast member) in Season 2, SO I believe Alice Cooper and FP jones had a baby together! I KNOW WHAT YOUR THINKING, this may be a long stretch but think about the evidence. Leanne mentioned That Betty might have a long lost brother, now there is two ways this theory can go. Part 1, Alice and FP could have gotten drunk one night or just really liked each other And made no one other than, JUGGY! I know still a long stretch but think about this they have confirmed more incest and if Jughead was Alice's son then that would mean he was Betty's half BROTHER which would confirm the incest. Part 2 Alice and FP could have still had a baby together but he was not Jughead and if Alice had left HAL like FP said later in this season and they started dating that would also make JUGGY and BETTY BROTHER AND SISTER and if they were to stay dating that would worse than POLLY AND JASON INCEST RIGHT THERE. BUT HEY THATS JUST A THEORY....A FILM THEORY aka #MATPAT #THEFILMTHEORIST No but seriously I just made this whole theory with just this episode and watching Sweetwater secrets and I'm only TWELVE #DIEHARDFANDOM",-0.889,364

"The show is based on the comics, it is very fair to have barchie in the show since it was in the comics. It will be boring asf if betty and jughead keep going on and off for the whole of the shows duration. Betty and Archie are good for each other anyway, bughead is kinda toxic",0.4927,61

"They have hinted at Cheryl liking josie, despite her also trying being obsessive about her, and there has been theories about her and Toni being a thing later on, I know in the comics veronica and betty have a thing a couple times so I wouldn't doubt and I hope at some point they have a thing with either Beronica or Cheryl",0.198,65

"YES. I thought that Riverdale was going to keep the famous love triangle of the comics going, but when Betty and Veronica kissed at tryouts, I immediately started shipping them. Much to my chagrin, Beronica never went anywhere after that, but I was unable to ship the ""mainstream"" Bughead and Varchie.
Also, I completely agree on the Toni and Cheryl thing. I think that at one point Vanessa even said that she shipped them, and I think their characters would make a great couple.",0.9023,97
