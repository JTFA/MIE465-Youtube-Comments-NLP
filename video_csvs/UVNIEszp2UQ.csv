Every major civilization that's ever existed that was a beacon of love, learning and tolerance has been completely decimated by the Darkside. The latest and honestly one of the smallest, being the republic, has always leaned towards the Dark side, being currupt, and letting money and influence rule over actual diplomacy.

"Fletch K In the Context of the previous 7 movies this film makes even less sense. No context is given to explain how the characters we are supposed to relate to got themselves or the republic into this situation Episdoes I-VI are made irrelevant in the opening crawl ""The FIRST ORDER reigns. Having decimated the peaceful Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke now deploys his merciless legions to seize military control of the galaxy."" Episode VII turns out to be a giant Red Herring. Who is Snoke? Why did Lukes light saber reach out to Rey? Why did we hear Obi-Wans voice in Rey's force Dream? The entire plot of TFA revolved around a Map to Luke. Why did this map exist? Why did R2-D2 have half the map? Why did R2-D2 wake from his coma when Rey showed up? Apparently none of that mattered.

I understand making an attempt to subvert the audiences expectations but this movie just seemed to go out of its way to trash everything leading up to it. Collapse",-0.4158,192

2) Explicit shots and close-ups of everyone's friend, cousin, neighbor, and even the coffee guy?  Yep.  It's good to know people.
3) A plot?  Just any plot?  If lifting a few rocks and worrying about running out of gas is your thing, I suppose.
4) Incompetent antagonists lacking depth?  An old man in his pajamas and cliche, frothing-at-the-mouth zealots.  Yay.
5) The ""Let's show off what aliens the animators made"" shot""? Oh, yeah.  And this time you even went to space-Monaco to do it.
6) ""People seemed to like the original films. Let's write some of them into the new films and see if anyone notices.""  I already saw Empire; I liked it.  I don't need to see a lesser man's version.
7) ""I know: What if the hero's journey wasn't an actual journey?""  Yeah - work is hard.
8) A protagonist who mustn't overcome a flaw?  Gosh-darn-it, Rey, is there nothing you can't do?  I know, you probably couldn't fly through space like an angel, or an ex-politician.  But, you're still an angel.  We really love you, Rey.  You're going to make Disney so much money.",0.965,284

No spoilers. The movie didn't impress me. It wasn't bad but it wasnt too good either. All of the previous questions and hints raised from the previous film are either brushed over or feel cheap in answer. There are a few scenes where the cgi feels over the top. But the main point of criticism is concerning the comedy. It stands out like a sore thumb. They had to have something humorous every five minutes and feels as cheap as having an action movie with explosions or fast action every other scene. The structure was broken because of this. The tone felt like Star Wars in most of the movie but scenes like Leia slapping Poe were out of place. We don't get to see Luke at his full potential and any originality people might suggest comes from loose ideas explored in the extended universe. The movie didn't explore the lore enough and felt hollow. I don't think any of the aliens were practical like the last movie did. There are scenes and plot points that are redundant and will likely once again be dropped for the final installment like the casino community. I did like that Leia can use the Force. The writing could have been far better. The Jedi teachings could have been explored better. Snoke could have been explored better. It's almost like the director didn't like the direction of the previous movie and threw away most of it so he could do his own thing. That is a poor way to handle a sequel and I hope he doesn't return to the franchise unless he brings something better then what we got here. The previous movie has a far better structure and feels more like a complete idea and story. This is also coming from a guy that didn't care for the rebooted Star Trek movies. T,0.9834,333

People were complaining that bombs don't drop in space. But guess what there is no noise in space either but who could watch SW without it? My point is why so serious? When everyone, even hard critics, are gonna keep feeding the machine, buying DVDs, reading the books, knocking down little kids in the store for the new figures. Sit back and enjoy.",0.7882,155
