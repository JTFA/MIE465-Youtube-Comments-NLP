It’s too bad that some Eagles fans took things a bit far with throwing beer cans. But let’s also realize that there were no serious injuries and nobody was killed. Unlike what happened in San Fran, Oakland, Dallas and other cities. People just love to bash Eagles fans because they wish their fanbase was as passionate.

"Somebody with me, watch 2:01-2:05 in slow motion. Watch Theilen, does it look like he avoids tackling Patrick Robinson? He apparently had back problems, but if you're not healthy enough to tackle, you're not healthy enough to be tackled. Knowing what happens, this play might have been crucial to the momentum of the game. Theilen had 3 catches, barely any impact at all. This is the NFC Championship game, you HAVE to make that tackle. Evidently, the Vikings did not deserve to win the Super Bowl, or even get there because of things like that. 

However, if you ask me, 7:35 was the play that changed everything. 3rd and 10, late in the half, midfield, the Eagles are thinking touchdown?!?!?!? After that, this offense becomes unstoppable for the rest of the season. They go down the field and get a field goal before the half. After the half the flea flicker play is executed perfectly despite the Vikings best efforts. 

Look at 7:08. That is an undrafted runningback breaking a tackle from a 9th overall pick. It just goes to show you, once you're in the NFC Championship game, it doesn't matter when you were drafted or if you were drafted.",0.5334,240
