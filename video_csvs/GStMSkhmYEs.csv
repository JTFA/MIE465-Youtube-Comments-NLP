"Dude, most of your pronunciations are fine, some even good but just a small tip. In India, pronounce it how you spell it. It's pun-jaab. There's no double o in there. It's not poon-jaab cause that's not how you spell it. I really like your videos and I love the fact that you're trying and it's an admirable effort but, just a tip, no disrespect, pronounce it like you spell it. Most Indian words are pronounced like you spell them.",0.9503,93
