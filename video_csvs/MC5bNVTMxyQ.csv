"While everyone watches this in a little Corrupt town named Cowlitz County. Judge Koss is racist as well as many of the judges there. The prosecutors are just kids that just sit around and let the judge decide who he wants to punish. On Dec 28, 2017 at 8:30 am court 4 The prosecutor requested a bail for an inmate of $500 and the Judge Koss decided to raise it to $15,000 just cause he was mad for seing a Mexican  speculator. Then after recess he started talking about a Mexican defendant case without having the person or the lawyer present. Also defendant lawyer Van Rollins was seen helping the prosecutor side with more evidence to against the defendant. Also Van Rollins was seen in jail sitting down with the inmates to defend them and every inmate she represented, she would ask the inmate what she should say,  apparently the inmates have more knowledge than an a 72 year old attoney. The defendant's attorney's including Charles Angelico, Dan Morgan, Van Rollins and others are asking every inmate to plead guilty just to close a case. They say it is better deal to plead guilty because they dont want to meet with inmates and not do there diligence to defend there client. Obviously they play both sides. There is alot of evidence to support how corrupt Cowlitz County is. They just want to incarcerate inmates to make money for they county since they cant provide jobs for the people. Law enforcement keeps targeting people and even do random stops using 2 or more vehicles. They where 3 Officers at WinCo getting food while in Uniform when they should be protecting The City not there stomachs. The Mexican community are constantly targeted and harshly punished with maximum sentences just cause the Judges feel like they are a abomination to this city for not being white. They are supposed to be judging the crime not the race. No wonder this town is a dump. The evidence is all there for the ones that want to bring justice to America. They are all being recorded by there own cameras and No One reviews them. KEEP DOING NOTHING FOR THIS COUNTY,  IF U WANT MORE NAZY'S Imprisoning humans in these HOLOCAUST JAILS.
