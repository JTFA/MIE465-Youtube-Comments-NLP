A lot of talk no substance. Second weekend dropped 56% another big drop after making less than 100 mil. Yes JL will lose a lot of money.  JL opened world wide every where so it blew its load and will make less every weekend internationally. No big openings except Japan in the waits. JL was mediocre and how is it going in the right direction when they STILL kept the deadline even though Whedon only had 6 months for reshoots. They havn't learned shit.

"About the ""villain problem"" ... I'm pretty sure that people kind of blow this out of proportion. Looking at the box office for most of these movie, it seems as if the general audience doesn't care about the villain. The reason why the MCU keeps on being succesful is because of how much we love the heroes and we want to see them grow and evolve. Take for example Thor: in the first movie he was this serious, arrogant and somewhat dumb warrior. Now he's grown smarter, has learned his place in the world and is able to crack a joke or two. The audience actually went along with him on this arc throughout the years and that's why they keep coming back. The villains on the other hand usually only have one movie to do their thing. I mean, it's no coincidence that the most beloved villain in the MCU is Loki, a character who has appeared in 4 movies and now also has gone through some character development of his own. Also, I don't think there are a lot of movies (comparatively) in which both the hero and the villain are great. Even in ""The Dark Knight"" you have a problem with the fact that Batman himself sort of got lost in the Joker's magnificence.",-0.2047,240

"As far as what Dan saying about the writer using the average of the multipliers for the previous 4 DEU movies to estimate the Domestic total gross. Yes he is correct in stating that it seems unfair considering that BvS and SS opened way bigger so their multiplier is going to be smaller. Yes that is true BUT......  MoS and WW opened very very closely to JL and not only that but WW's multiplier of 4 (almost UNHEARD of in blockbusters of this magnitude) brings the averages WAY up. In my opinion Wonder Woman's 4x multiplier brings the averages way higher than it should and thus it actually HELPS Justice League to calculate it that way.

ALSO the writer also used another method of using similar movies with similar openings, with similar RT and audience scores and such. I think he came up with like 3 different scenarios that resulted in 3 different estimates. All of which still saw the film  losing money for WB.

Now about his estimate for the Overseas number. The writer does make a point of stating that overseas is too hard to estimate with much accuracy. But about Dan's point... The Harry Potter franchise has ALWAYS been way more popular overseas than DC properties. So I don't see anything wrong with him estimating that JL falls well short of Fantastic Beasts' overseas gross.",0.9689,245

"I agree mostly on the Villain problem with Dan. The villains that worked best are usually the ones that get more screentime, like Loki, General Zod, Nolans Joker or the Villains in the TV-Shows. The problem with the tone is also there, but I feel like its the lesser problem here. Loki worked as a villain for example and he was serious enough, while being fitting in the world. And in the animated shows they also did great villains and they are usually less serious. Ultron for me worked best in the mightiest heros avengers show, because he was way more of an AI and they played that card much better, while in the Movie, he was more of a rampaging teenager with full on facial mimic. And they spend no time in the movies on developing the Ultron idea as they did in the animated series, where you can see and understand where Ultron is coming from, his logic and so on. They took away the background from Ultron and made him way too human, which kinda takes away the part that makes him more scary.",-0.0471,206

Also, the chart on the bottom doesn't factor those numbers for the other 19 films so it would've been irrelevant.

The whole article was about ""projections"", ""assumptions"" and what these numbers could ""suggest"". He makes a guesstimate based on actual information (which movies studios do) to intelligently find his figures, but you think they are off because Fantastic Beasts opened with $20M less than Justice League; therefore they can't make the same amount? Aside from that, the Fantastic Beasts argument is silly... even in Grace's video (which she got from another Forbes article). One had a incredibly successful franchise behind it, better reviews and greater word of mouth. It also had better general audience appeal. And If I'm wrong? It plays out very similarly and ends up with $800M+, I still won't feel stupid and neither should you. These are just projections based on what we know about an unknown.

There is no difference between this article thinking ahead and what you all do on your show (which I almost usually enjoy - Love you Roth!) when you discuss rumors and make your own assumptions based on those rumors.

"The term ""filling your coffers"" I believe refers to strongboxes for valuables or directly to briefcases. In German ""Koffer"" for example is the common word for a suitcase, as you would take on holiday, or sometimes it refers to a briefcase, mostly than as ""Aktenkoffer"", meaning a koffer for files.

"To start off, I really have no horse in this race. I'm not a DC fanboy, nor am I rooting for DC movies to fail. I simply want there to be as many good movies out there as possible, as it means there's more for me to watch and enjoy. My personal take on the movie is that it has many flaws, but was enjoyable to watch. In other words, it's nothing that's going to stick with me for any lengthy period of time, but in the moment it was entertaining enough.

With that out of the way, on to my take on the actual discussion. I actually have a bit of an issue with comparing Justice League's performance to Suicide Squad. Suicide Squad was able to build some serious hype, despite BvS's issues...only to have a big drop off when people realized how flawed Suicide Squad was itself. I remember people saying that it didn't matter, because both movies still raked in so much money. Even then, however, there was a problem that should have been evident. It's not simply a matter of how much money those two movies made. Those movies were a large part of the effort to set the foundation for an ongoing series of blockbuster movies. Yes, you want them to make a lot of money, but you also need them to establish and maintain good will with the audience. With the exception of the die hard fanboys and girls, they failed. The more you reinforce the idea that you can't count on them to produce a great movie, the less benefit of the doubt potential viewers are going to give future movies. Yeah, Wonder Woman helped stop the bleeding a bit, but it's not surprising that the culmination movie's opening could be hurt by the lack of faith generated by the build up movies. So, pointing out that Suicide Squad opened higher doesn't really mean anything to me, since that movie wasn't being as negatively affected by prior movies as Justice League has been.

As for the discussion of merchandising, Dan is right. Leaving those numbers out definitely skews the results. Having said that, I can understand why the author may have chosen to do so. To begin with, the issue of just how much of that goes to WB was already brought up. There's an even bigger problem with those calculations, however. How do you determine what percentage of merchandise sales are movie inspired, and how much would have happened anyway had Justice League never been made? Do you count only merchandise released with the movie tag on it, or do you include merchandise featuring characters from the Justice League? On the flip side, while you would need to include the numbers from sales of movie specific merchandise, how much of that is REALLY inspired by the movie itself. In other words, if the movie had never been made, how much Justice League merchandise would have been sold anyway? Finally, there's the issue of estimating those numbers. Given the long history of the Justice League and the characters in it, more people are likely to give the movie a shot (even if they've been burned before). Merchandise sales, however, are more likely to be affected by the quality of the movie itself. Sure, maybe someone will still by merchandise featuring the Justice League or one of its members, but will they buy movie specific merchandise or simply character related merchandise? So, to sum things up: Yeah, leaving merchandising numbers out skews the results and makes things seem worse than they actually are, but there are serious issues in calculating (or even estimating) those numbers.",0.963,687
