"Aaron D I think what he was getting at with the comment on how limiting boost is, was that it only provides a degree of cushioning which is fair enough for a lifestyle shoe I admit, however when it comes to performance, it lacks highly. There‚Äôs not much responsiveness at all, and also a lack of stability with its design.
