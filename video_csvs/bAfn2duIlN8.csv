"iJustine a few tips next time you try and bake pumpkin pie. Find a recipe that isn't on the can, from experience the ones on boxes and cans never turn out great, at least for me. My standard recipe (I believe I originally found it on food networks website but have since tweaked it) for pumpkin pie is 2 cups mashed or puréed pumpkin, 8 ounces of cream cheese, a cup of half and half, half a stick of melted unsalted butter (I usually end up using most of the stick so a lil more than half), 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1 egg plus 2 egg yolks, and some nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger to taste. Preheat oven to 350
Dough: use premade or make your own but with pies like pumpkin or pecan, par baking the shell is what will really seal the deal. So lay your dough into a buttered pie plate, assemble how you like (crimping, etc.) and then use a fork to poke whole in the bottom. Put your assembled pie shell in the freezer for like an hour to set. After it sets take some parchment paper (long enough to cover the pie) and weight down the crust with pie weights or about 2lbs of dried beans (this keeps the dough from slipping or loosing shape) Bake in the oven for 10-20 mins (check on it after 10 and don't go over 20 mins) take out of the oven, remove parchment paper/dried beans (if you use beans let them cool and store in ziplock bag and label as pie weights for next time) from crust and set you pie plate aside 
For the filling: In a mixing bowl: beat cream cheese until smooth, and pumpkin and beaut until combined. Then add sugar and salt, and mix until combined. Then add in the  eggs, half and half, and melted butter, mix until well combined. Finally add the vanilla and a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, and mix until well combined. At this point take a little taste of the filling to make sure you like the flavor and to see if you need to add more spices. If you feel it's lacking, sprinkle in more cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger mix then taste again (repeated this until you have desired flavor) once your happy with you filling, pour filling into you par baked dough and return to the oven for 50mins or until the center is set. The sides can still be a bit jiggly, you just need to make sure you can poke the center with a tooth pick and it comes out clean. Once that happens, remove from oven, let it cool, and enjoy 😊 
I totally get what you were trying to do with the design, I actually made a turkey out of pie dough (using a cookie cutter) to add decorative elements to mine, next time use the piece you cut out and not the outline of it. Bake for like 10-15 mins on a cookie sheet while pie is baking. Remove it from the oven after max 15 mins and then when your pie is down to the 15-20 mins of baking, and you decorative element to the center. Continue baking pie until done. Tip: when I did my dough turkey, I melted butter and mixed it with cinnamon sugar, the basted my little pie dough turkey in the mixture before baking. I hope this helps you next baking adventure.",0.9958,665
