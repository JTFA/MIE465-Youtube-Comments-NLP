"I love this!! I want to be able to make over my parents offices, they have been working in their own business since 2001, often working more than 12 hours every day. Their business involves allowing people to hire out their rooms, but their rooms are very 2007esque. Think black backed, blue fabric spin office chairs and old fake wooden desks. 
I think redoing their offices and such would bring in more business and they'd be able to be home a lot more! 
Would you be able to help me out? I don't know how to make the place look nice and also function... e.g. We kind of need chairs that can rise and fall... & this comment was a lot larger than intended",0.783,140
