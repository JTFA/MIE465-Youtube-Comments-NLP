Isn't it possible that turkey digests in such a way that the tryptophan is released first and so it does in fact have chance to get into the brain especially if you eat sugary food with it which helps tryptophan cross BBB. So maybe the sugar and the tryptophan are getting to the brain faster than the other amino acids.,0.5574,62

"No buddy. I don't know shit about those chemicals but if you live long enough and seen enough turkey dinner, you'll come to realize that you ate a lot more food at buffets but yet the turkey dinner makes you sleepy. And having a big meal doesn't mean that your body wants to sleep. It just has no need to hunt for the next meal. So it relaxes but relaxing and sleeping are two different thing. I relax when i watch a movie. The biggest meal of the day is at the end of the day but we usually don't go to bed or have a nap after. We wait to bed time. Like i said, I don't know crap about your chemicals, hormones, proteins or whatever, something at the Thanks Giving, Christmas and New Year dinners makes us sleepy. Millions of people know this. Maybe there is too many variables for you to know the real reason. Maybe eating turkey by itself with no other food would not give you that effect. Have you check that yet? Maybe it a combination. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.",0.9664,209
