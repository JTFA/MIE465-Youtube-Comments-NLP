"Dear friends Jesus Christ loves you so much. He wants you to give your life to Him today and worship only Him. Whatever occupies your mind the most becomes your god. Worries, if indulged develop into idols. Anxiety gains a life of its own, parasitically infesting your mind. Break free from this bondage by affirming your trust in Jesus. Jesus knows every single thing about you and what your thoughts are. He rejoices when your mind turns towards Him. Have complete faith in the power and the love of Jesus Christ. Guard your thoughts diligently; good thoughts-choices will always keep you close to our Lord and Savior. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Psalm 112:7;  1 John 5:5;  Galatians 2:20;  Corinthians 13:11)",0.9841,140
