"+Andreana - The USA has pretty much ALWAYS had immigration laws.  Those laws have not been changed since the change in the Presidency.  Unconstitutional EOs have been signed, but that doesn't change the law.

Most of the world doesn't want to immigrate to the USA now that trump is President.  He's a disgrace and most of the world is laughing about how terrible his first year has been... except when we're getting incredibly nervous about whether he's going to start a nuclear war, that is.

"Abdulai Bah. You should be surprised. From everything I have read and heard from President Trump himself is this, all he wants is that everyone should have a job, have terrific health cover which is affordable not the breaking thing under Obamacare. Then they should offer their children affordable childcare and a great education. He would like to see everyone have enough money to have a good time, buy things and enjoy their lives. I have not seen anywhere that he wants to rob the poor to pay the rich. His own money has come from various sources such as from property, television, beauty pageants and overseas properties. He is not dependent on getting the poor to give him or his children a living. They all have their own businesses and do very well. He employs around 25,000 people so he has a pretty good idea of what people want. Many of those people are African Americans so there goes all the ideas relating to racism on his part. He is a shrewd businessman who knows very well that if the middle class has very little money they are no longer middle class any longer. If they have nothing then business can make nothing and so the knock on effect goes all the way down. Trump wants everyone to have more and he will do what he can to ensure that they get it.",0.9668,253

As Trump says, they do not want the Republicans to succeed so this is their solution. They are not patriotic Americans which is what the people must see and understand. They are cheating, lying, thieving fools who were part and parcel of running down America. If they get in again as the government, the Republicans sure as hell know what to do when they are in opposition. What goes around comes around! Thank God I do not live in America.

"Ucreavvesh, You don't understand my comment.  It is a response to the first reply to the OP.   The original comment I responded to made no distinction between ""Europeans who came here for a better life,""  and Europeans who came here to ""invade.""  From the standpoint of the natives, it is doubtful you can separate the two without very strict controls on migration.  So since you do see a distinction between the two (as I also do), then is it safe to say you favor strict regulation of who is allowed to migrate into our country?  I certainly agree that the Native Americans would have benefited from a very strict migration policy, of course, this is hindsight and, of course, they were at a technological and epidemiological disadvantage.
