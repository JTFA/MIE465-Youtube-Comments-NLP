"Love vibes all around-Good Job Snoop Lion & Uncle Charlie💖👣keep walking by faith in God as He continues to do His transforming work in your lives to uplift & encourage others. Don't listen to religious haters. You belong to God-He will lead & guide you in all Truth not just for your own families but to make an example that God can use whomever He wants to for specific purposes. At the end of the day all of our minds need renewing in the Creator through Jesus. Anyone who thinks they are better than another brother or sister because of the level of faith they perceive themselves need to humbly pray for others as they work out their own soul salvation. After all is paid & done, the 1st Evangelist that Jesus directly influenced was a whoremonger compelled to change by his grace & gift. This album is just a fruity of Snoops gratitude knowing he doesn't deserve God's grace, but who really earned it?? Everything that has breath can praise the Lord, as the Word commands. Take heart & take care!",0.9911,198

"Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Charlie Wilson]
It's just one more day
The lord has kept me (woah-woah-woah)
Oh, don't rush, keep the pace
I'm focused on my goal
I need to tell the story, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Get together in a state to make me great
Even when I fell flat on my face
You gave me grace
Lord knows that, I haven't been an angel and I'm no saint
But I'll always take the time to give you face
For all you've done for me

[Chorus: Choir + (Charlie Wilson)]
One more day (one more day)
One more day (God)
God has given us (one more day)
One more day (one more day)
One more day (come on children)
One more day (God)
God has given us (one more day)
One more day (God)
God has given us (one more)
One more

[Verse 2: Charlie Wilson + (Choir)]
It's just one more day
That the lord has kept me (woah-oah-oah)
And I take this special moment (special moment)
To tell you about my life, the ups and downs
You don't know the half, it was almost a wrap for me

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Get together in a state to make me great
Even when I fell flat on my face
You gave me grace
Lord knows that, I haven't been an angel and I'm no saint
But I'll always take the time to give you face
For all you've done for me

[Chorus: Choir + (Charlie Wilson)]
One more day (ooh-wee)
One more day (oh-a)
God has given us (one more day)
One more day (can you sing it again?)
One more day (oh-oh, one more)
One more day (God)
God has given us (has given us)
One more day (sing it again)
God has given us (one more)
One more (one more day)

[Verse 3: Charlie Wilson]
He picked me up
And he turned me around
And he placed my feet
And I'm looking pretty good right now
First crackhead, that you ever did see

[Refrain: Charlie Wilson + (Choir)]
But listen, I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
