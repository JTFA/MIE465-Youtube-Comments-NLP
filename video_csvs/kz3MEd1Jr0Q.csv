"My heart beats
A little faster
When our eyes meet
In the middle of
A crowded room
In knee deep
Testing waters
I've got a feeling
And i don't know what to do you
Got me paralyzed
And i think i like it
Caught me by surprise
I'm not usually like this,no
Got me paralyzed
Don't think i can help it
 why's it feel so right ?
Let's keep this going all night
Going all night
Going all night
Going all night
The crowd fades
Tunnel vision
In a daze
And the only thing i feel is you
In perfect
Syncopation
Face to face
tell me do you feel it to you
Got me paralized
And i think i like it
Cought me by surprise
I'm not usually like this,no
Got me paralyzed
Don't think i can fight this
Why's it feel so right
Let's keep this going all night
Going all night
Going all night 
Going all night
But maybe i should wait
Let it fall into place
Couse i keep going over the things that could come from me feeling this way
And i don't want to play
This emotional game 
But when you pull me closer i cannot deny that i want you to stay
Woahhhhhhhh :v
You got me
You got me
Got me paralized
Woahhh     xd 
Got me paralyzed

"People thanks for making this happen 10 MILLION VIEWS for the lyric video and more than 9 MILLION VIEWS on the official video, thanks for making this happen happen again and shout out to my precious girl🙈 Lauren, no matter what I love that lovely raspy voice she has it's so unique, and tbh she's got me paralyzed with that song, let's keep supporting her in every thing she does in the future...getting back to her I love how she defends her self and how she also just doesn't think about her self she also thinks about her people and use the harmonizers and the laurenators how she tries to defend us by using her voice how no matter what situation she's going through in her life she's always there for us to stand for us and to put on a great show, to make us feel better and just make us feel the life with her music, and who ever is reading this I'm so thankful for y'all making her career shine and we're all in this together to make her dreams keep going, give a fuck to the others who say that she has no talent because she really does, give a fuck to people who say she's just a princess popstar⭐🌟 because she's more than that,and just don't listen to this bitches because they have no fuckin idea of wtf they're talking about, because she's everything to the true harmonizers like us, she's more than just a popstar...shes a brave and a courageous woman who keeps making us not quit in life who says what she has in her mind, and who's not afraid of anything, she's really special to me in every kinda way, like for the lgbt group, even if I'm not gay, lesbian bisexual, or transgender, even if I'm nothing of those tittles it doesn't matter because people who are in the lgbt group they're still lovely human beings and they don't deserve to be discriminated, they are people who belong. And secondly she's always interested in the feminism there is, in my words every women on this world no matter what age or sexuality our lovely women have, y'all are all special, brave, unique, beautiful, gorgeous women ♀, don't let nothing step in your way or stop you, no one or man is in charge from y'alls actions. And so very special to me, she's the one who at least try to do something for our world these days like the NRA, and immigrants that I really care about and I'm really curious from what they are going through🖑...so let's keep supporting her in every thing, let's do the same for, let's keep being there for when she needs our company and opinions💐. Thanks for anyone who's reading this🙄",0.9975,513
