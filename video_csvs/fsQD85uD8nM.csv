Cami-Michelle Schulz I've been wondering that too with period piece shows/movies it's sometimes clear the actress is wearing extensions. Back then I think mainly royals had the super long hair and were able to pull off more elaborate hairstyles but the poor women could/would sell their hair for wigs so maybe they also had a type of hair extension too? Just like loose hair that could be added into braids or a ponytail.,-0.1531,80

"Hi, saw your video through as an add in one of the vids I was watching and love your tutorial but, point of correction, the shows Victoria and The Crown are biopics of the real Queen Victoria and the real Queen Elizabeth II. In other words its true story, I'm not trying to be mean to you but, as a Brit I'm a bit scandalized when you called them fiction just watch the interviews that Matt Smith and Clare Foy of The Crown talking about it. Even Jenna Coleman from Victoria says they read her diaries to stay true to her life story.

"Let's not forget that Queen Victoria has been completely whitewashed in Victoria. Not only was she a horrible mother to her children (specifically her daughters) most of the time, she also couldn't have cared less about the Irish and the Great Famine. Only after her Prime Minister urged her to do so she asked protestants to raise money for the Irish and donated a measly £2,000. Since it was royal protocol, no one could give more than her. Ottoman sultan Abdulmejid I would have donated £10,000 but was told not to because it would have offended Victoria.",-0.4824,108

That tiara is a replica of Queen Elizabeth II called the Girls of great Britain and Ireland given to Queen Mary as a wedding gift in 1893...the daughter in law of Victoria. I haven't seen the show but looks like they used it in a photo with Victoria which would be inaccurate. I wonder if they are as prop-accurte as the crown was in their replicas.,0.775,71

"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!

Jesus loves you! He is not angry at you! He does not hate you, either! So stop believing the devil's lies. 

Jesus died and rose again for us, so that we may live!
Being a Christian doesn't mean your life will be free of trials and tribulations, but it means that you have your inheritance in Christ. Your new home is heaven, where there will be no more death, sorrows, or illness.

I share this message here, because I want you all to be partakers of this Awesome Gift we have been given freely by The Lord. 

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He will forgive you, He will redeem you, He will deliver you from your sins, He will make you new! Hallelujah!

He did for me, friends. I have literally seen and felt The Lord's Working Power! This is something I have seen with my own eyes! This is why I preach. 

The Lord will also save you from the oncoming judgement approaching this earth! He made a Way to escape it, by His Body on the cross. He took our punishment upon Himself. Thank You, Jesus!

So friends, Jesus is no doubt coming. The signs are here that He warned us about, but we might go to Him today, so this is why there is an urgency to share this Life-Saving Message of Jesus! It's dangerous to pass from this life before accepting Jesus' Sacrifice for us, because He is the Only Way to escape. 

Please make Jesus your Lord and Savior today by calling upon Him. You will be saved! No fancy prayer needed, just speak from your heart to Him and let Him know what you've heard and read about Him, and admit that you need His Help. He will listen, friends. He will help, and He will forgive you if you seek His Forgiveness. He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him! Thank You, Jesus!

Shalom!",0.9956,390
