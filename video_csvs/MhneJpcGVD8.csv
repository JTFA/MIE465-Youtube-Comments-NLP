Benny Boi How come? What are you gonna drive if you get married and have kids??? I hope you won't get a Honda civic it's to small for a family. Just you wait until hoe popular this SUV will become it's a beast!!!!,0.8329,51
"Benny Boi between that and the Aventador. Huracan as the better transmission, but the v12 and the looks of the Aventador are unbeatable! Hard choice my friend",0.7133,30
"Benny Boi don't consider it ""lucky"" haha. I have no funds for a lambo right now. I am about to get my real estate license. Give me 2 years. I will have the newest huracan. 

In the meantime, i will keep buying cool cars :)",0.7269,53
"Benny Boi haha i will brotha. Browse my videos, if you like them, subscribe. When i make the huracan video, you'll know :)",0.8176,28
"Benny Boi i just might! But there is only one way to find out, and that is to drive both!",0.0,23
"Benny Boi overall brotha, I'm just saying that it is VERY realistic. I have almost no money now, but watch how i make a ton of it, how i network with others, and how in a few years i can have everything i want and more. The only thing that get's you there is hard work, consistency, and networking.",-0.154,68

It looks the size of a medium class SUV. Certainly not the overly huge LM002 which was a Hummer competitor.,0.1124,22
"It's a Lamborghini with less than 10 cylinders; it's nowhere near as crazy cool as the concept car; and, it looks far too sensible...

I really am not impressed. You should have shoved a Huracan V10 in there, left the styling the same as the concept, and given it more HP. This is far too boring to wear the Bull-badge.",-0.1978,69

Nodog 87 That Lamborghini reminds me of the speed racer car the mark six and somewhat of the mark five. I hope you know speed racer movie and cartoon. If you know awesome and if you don't know you got issues lol!!!!!,0.8469,47
RB26 likeaboss It's fine bro it has twin turbos. Maybe later in it's production it will be available for a v10 engine!!!!!,0.453,26
Really nice,0.4754,2
Snakebloke Also if you want something not boring looking and a very very fast car get yourself in a Koenigsegg agera rs the fastest car in the world would be enough for you to be very satisfied and probably put you in your place because Koenigsegg agera rs has a v8 engine that beat the mighty 16 cylinder engine of the Bugatti Chiron!!!!! The v8 engine will show you it's mighty power to put you in your place the power of a v8 engine!!!!!!,0.7596,90
"Snakebloke Cylinders don't matter bro. The venom gt has 8 Cylinders engine beating the mighty big  Bugatti Veyron's16 Cylinders engine!!!!!! Horsepower with twin turbos is enough to make this SUV fast man. The GTR supercar killer has a v6 engine naturally aspirated that could beat v8, v10, 12, even a v16 if they added more more horsepower!!!! If you wanna know how I know this I go to school about learning supercars and hypercars. Anything is fast in the ground with four wheels I know about them!!!!",-0.8147,103
Snakebloke The style of this new Lamborghini Urus is awesome. Really don't know what's wrong with this SUV style and the engine it has. How about this try to get yourself in this Urus and see if this is enough power twin turbo v8 650 engine is to satisfy you and see this car in person to see how non-boring this SUV is. Alot people say it looks boring or ugly in the video or picture. Then they change what they said after riding one and seeing it in person. Get yourself a ride and see this beast in person then we will talk.,0.6192,110
