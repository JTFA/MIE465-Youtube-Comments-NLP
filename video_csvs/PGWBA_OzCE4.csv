I don't think it's that huge a deal because if you're that desperate to know the score you're probably going to watch it anyway. If you're not, just have to wait a day or so. The slightly annoying thing (as Dan said on SJU) is RT making themselves the story when it's just an aggregate and they've prev abdicated responsibility for the score.

"I think that the average score given by critics should be the main focus of Rotten Tomatoes rather than the fresh rating. It gives a much better sense of whether or not the film is good. People are lazy, most don't bother to read what is actually being said, and many don't really understand what the fresh meter really means. You can get a film that has an average score of 3.1 and is 80 - 90% fresh and another film with an average score of 2.9 with a 30 - 45% fresh rating. The problem being that even though critics opinions were very close on both films, many people will just see the fresh rating and assume critics LOVED one and HATED the other. Just look at how many outlets use the fresh rating in their headlines along side phrases like ""Critics adore"" or ""Critics slam"". They then go on to only highlight critics that agree with their headline.",0.8725,176
"I think the Rotten Tomatoes thing is a bunch of bullshit. Making people watch your shitty show to get the overall critic score and hiding reviews until the night the movie opens is really lame. Hiding a score is one thing but hiding reviews as well is beyond stupid! On the other hand, I don't think people should see or not see a movie based on a score/review(s) but some are still curious what it is and don't want to spend hours counting up 100+ reviews and getting the overall score. Which they can't even do because reviews aren't there. 

Pretty odd that it happens to be for a DCU movie which has had very low or divisive reviews in the past and revealing a low score could hurt the box office (it shouldn't but it does). Also, the fact that WB owns part of RT. Seems pretty sketchy to me. I won't watch the show and can wait to see the score but it would be nice to read some reviews ahead of time (yes you can go direct to the review but having them all on one site makes it much easier to find).

I love the DCU and hiding a bad overall score would benefit the movie but I think it's bad business and all people should have the chance to see reviews or a score if they want before seeing a movie whether it's right or not. It's their money and their time. If they don't do the same for other blockbuster movies I will never support anything RT ever does again. I guarantee you they will not hide a score for an MCU or SW movie until the night it opens. If they do I will be incredibly shocked!",-0.7402,320

"I'm with Kristian on this one. RT made a terrible decision to debut this show with this movie. I'm sure the critics and two people on the show are both capable but that is irrelevant. This is the internet and I'm sorry Schnepp you and I may read reviews from different critics that make up the aggregate score for RT but your average Joe or Jane only goes to RT for one thing and that's the Number. They're used to it being that simple and to change that by presenting two individuals that they may or may not like is a huge misread, especially for a movie like this that has a rabid fan base and also a DC/ Marvel BS funny book boy feud that rivals Tupac and Biggie.

To say they are holding anything ""hostage"" is so silly. We dont pay for the service so there are no ""rights"".

"Y‚Äôall totally ‚ÄúMom‚Äôd‚Äù Kristian‚Äôs statement. It was not an insult at all. I think you just heard one with how he said it. He makes complete sense. If you‚Äôre gonna hold back a score for a movie and use it to promote a show, Justice League is not the one to do it with. Frankly, none of DCU‚Äôs movie should be used for that. Especially when Rotten Tomatoes has been blamed as a factor in DCU‚Äôs mediocre reception with general audiences. Rotten Tomatoes using the ‚Äútomato-meter‚Äù as a way to promote their show, only gives more to the silliness that Rotten Tomatoes has control over their ‚Äútomato meter‚Äù or that they generate their own scores. It‚Äôs an ass-backwards approach, if you ask me.",-0.6905,156

"as for this ""what men want"" movie? um no, this movie would need to be a H-A-R-D R if you are going to hear what every man around you is thinking, especially in her profession; she would be ""disgusting"" and crying on the floor every ten minutes",-0.6124,55

"the only way I can see ""What men want"" working is if they made it a hard r-rated comedy.    Because let's face it gents.  Unless you're talking to a guy that's a fucking saint, then chances are almost every asshole guy out there is a dirty dog to some degree.  Some more so than others.  Therefore, if they try to make it like pg 13 or some shit, then it'll fail.  But make it a hard r rated rom com?  Then yeah it has a chance.",-0.3041,98

"the teaser was great :).

oh score! right, i was like why are they holding back the soundtrack that¬¥s weird. but i see now, took a while... even though i know what it¬¥s about. hhhhh
it¬¥s smart for rt but is it good for the film? delaying it.

couldn't you do it as a more colorful scott pilgrim in a fantasy world? hire Edgar Wright :), maby taika or Lord & Miller? cgi has the most potential to 
work though.

why doesn¬¥t halloween keep all the curtis movies? she could still move back to the town right? didn¬¥t know she died... thanks :). really don¬¥t care, she could
come back and be like michael? same or opposite. immortal strodes, sounds like a band. take it :)!

should there be a satire award?

a terminator reciting shakespeare or poetry ;).
