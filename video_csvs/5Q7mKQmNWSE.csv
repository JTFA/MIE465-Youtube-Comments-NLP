You once mentioned the paperwork said they replaced some parts and paper work said refurbish.
Yes according to the paper work parts were replaced. But after verifying with sprint, the phone was not my original phone and with the samsung app info the manufacture date did not match the serial number.

You also mentioned you ran some info app that also reported it was refurbished...

The problem is with how the Charge Controller works. When the battery is fully depleted, there is no power for the Charge Controller to use for charging. So, its not a defect just poor engineering.

If what you're saying is applicable and true concerning all Note 8 batteries then then it should be 100% reproducible.

Samsung has a new battery issue in its latest phone

James Cook Dec 28, 2017, 8:43 AM ET

Corey Protin/Business Insider

Some people using Samsung's latest phone, the Galaxy Note 8, are complaining that it won't charge.

Samsung is reportedly aware of the problem and is replacing devices.

Samsung had serious battery issues in the Galaxy Note 7 when several phones exploded.

Let us know asap. 
I've had enough drama with the Note7 which I kept till the Note8 arrived. Never got (🔋) totally drained on N8 but after seeing this here plus there are threads on Sammy official forums with the same problem. I think I will permanently divorce myself from all Sammy products. I am a Linux person so iPhone doesn't grab me. 
Don't know what to do. 
Locked bootloaders, sealed batteries, slowing down phones (🍏)
All this is to make us buy pda's every freaking year. 
I don't buy an argument that for the sake of waterproofing the battery must be sealed. If I can pull out SIM/microSd slot so the same can be done with the battery. 
We need a class action lawsuit here.

You once mentioned the paperwork said they replaced some parts and paper work said refurbish.

Were you able to just power phone on and eveything was still there on your phone, example:

A. Music

C. Contacts
D. Configurations
E. Files you may have put on phone
F. all screens were still arranged with icons the way you set it up,

G.  Everything originally on your new phone was still there on the replacement / refurbished phone

Or

You had to add account, reinstall everything again 

Because it's possible to replace battery, change phone type to refurbished and all contents on your phone would remain the same...  So all you would have to do is just login in ( if you have password ) and everything would still be there including the way all your screens were configured...

It's also possible to give you a different phone and copy all items on your old phone to new phone, but even if they did copy everything ( they could  ) it's highly unlikely the user interface ( # of screens you used, items on each screen assuming you use more than on screen, email accts you may have setup, would still be there...

If you have access to your original serial #

A. Do you still have original box the original ( new ) phone came in?

Or did you send your phone to be repaired in the original box.   Because they may have returned it in different Samsung Note 8 box so serial #s would match if they gave you different phone...

B. Your receipt or paper work when you purchased your new Note 8 may have the original serial # on it.  


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So goal is to determined what did you get back...

#1 
Original phone with only battery changed & phone status internally changed to refurbished

#2
Original phone with only battery changed & phone status internally changed to refurbished AND phone was RESET TO FACTORY DEFAULT ( which means you'd have to set phone up again as if it were brand new )

#3
They gave you a DIFFERENT PHONE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm trying to determine is issue with:

A. batteries...
B. circuits in batteries

C. Hardware charging circuits

D. Software


The fact that older phones which are experiencing this same phenomena does not rule out that there is same or similar hardware, software or battery specs are being used in all these phones...

Try discharging battery again completely and doing following below as some other user suggested to see if it in fact won't charge again...

From Bravest Bullfighter:

This is actually normal behavior with almost all batteries.  The protection circuitry sees zero voltage and thinks the battery is faulty so it won't charge it.

Business Insider is reporting the issue and using this video as example of one of the users who have experienced the issue & documented it with video...

https://amp.businessinsider.com/samsung-has-a-battery-issue-in-the-galaxy-note-8-2017-12

Thanks for info on requesting a repair instead of replacement...

But I'll have to get them to confirm in writing that they'll:

#1
Replace battery if that will fix problem

#2
Otherwise send my broken phone back to me because I purchased an extended replacement and accidental warranty that will give me a new phone and I'll use that if Samsung cannot fix phone by replacing battery only because there's no need to give me a refurbish or new phone since I can get that from store...


Samsung provided this statement about the problem: ""We have yet to get any official report for this matter and are unable to comment until we obtain more specific information of the device. Any customers with a similar matter are encouraged to contact Samsung at 0330 726 7864.""


As it gains more visibility they'll be forced to address it.

Hopefully they'll be able to isolate it to hardware, serial #s or date codes of batch affected assuming it's hardware issue.

If it's in software as you mentioned, which is a very probable cause, then they should be able to resolve this with software update...

The fact that batteries from Nexus 7 & Note 8 are most likely not same nor is charging circuitry it's probably software related, unless their is some hardware design flaw that prevents software from obtaining ( reading ) values it needs to give ok to charge battery...

I want to drain my battery to see if my phone is affected but won't right now because I've spent too much time configuring it.

I'm going to take screenshots of all my user interface ( screen Windows and on screen folder contents ), and email & other accounts setup...

It'll be a big hassle if my phone is affected...

I hope they can identify the issue and create some code and release app that one could run that would determine if one's phone is affected or not without having to drain battery to 0% and it not coming back up...

That way I will request a new Note 8 phone in advance and configure it while I can compare both Note 8 phones side by side,  verify everything is working & configured same as original Note 8 phone, then and only then factory reset original Note 8 and send it back...

I'm going to call several major tv  news outlets in my area and Let them know they should broadcast this to let public know there has been reported issues with Note 8 phones not charging if battery drains to zero so you may not want to let it drain to 0% until Samsung figures it out...

It'll spread like wildfire because media loves controversy especially something as juicy as this since Note 7 fiasco...

This is truly unacceptable that an approximately $1000 phone has this type of issues...  

Spent over $1700 on phone & accessories ( using black Friday sales & deep discounts ) for phone, 256GB card, many USB-C items: 4x wall chargers, 4x wireless chargers, 3x auto chargers, Gear 360, VR head gear, USB-C cables of varying lengths ( 2x 4', 3x 6', 4x 10' ), case, expensive ear buds & headphones to go with phone, etc...


Samsung should be testing for cases where phone is totally discharged...

Every Note 8 phone manufactured during initial release these past few months should be going through this basic discharge to 0% & recharge test...

That's why I always get a separate line and add new phone to that line and  bring it up and confirm over time everything is ok because if it's not I still  have my original phone and there's no disruption in service / my life...

Those people who upgraded or traded their original phones in for Note 7s and transfers original phone # from their previous phone to Note 7 got screwed over when they had to return the Note 7s...

I was fortunate because all I lost was time setting up and configuring Note 7 to look same, feel same and have same apps configured like those on my original phone...

If this issue affects even a hundred or several thousand confirmed ( public ) users then Samsung will be in bad position because millions of Note 8 users will not want to drain their phones to 0% to see if they have problem and since Samsung won't know which phones are affected and  they cannot screen new phones being manufactured & released to prevent them from getting to customers, I suspect potential new buyers & prospective customers will hold off buying Note 8 until issue is completely resolved...

I'm glad i stumbled across this YouTube video and people like yourself who are knowledgeable about history of this issue...

After getting my Note 8 I spent literally 3 to 4 days practically all day & night other than bio breaks and eating; setting up, configuring, transferring files, photos, videos, music, etc to Note 8 and tons of other stuff...

Takes awhile curating and moving 100+ GB of data to external micro ssd, arranging folders, names etc...

And literally so much more...",0.9771,960
"Leibo R Raibstein 

How do you know Samsung will replace battery only and not return refurbished phone?

Also, if this is a known issue that has existed before and the issue appears to occur when battery is full discharged to 0%, then why has no one been able to reproduce & recreate the issue including Google, Samsung, etc...

Thanks for response and info.   I'll do lil searching on my own to learn more about Nexus 7 issue

YouTube vid below titled:

2012 Nexus 7 Will not Turn on or Charge - Easy fix to bring it back to life


Here are the steps summed up that I covered in the video.

1)Plug into computer or USB outlet, if you have the original charger it came with, that is best. Let it charge for several hours, do not touch it! If the screen is flashing, that is okay.

2)Try to turn it on. Try different methods. Try holding the power button down with it plugged in, try without it plugged in, try holding it down as your plugging it in. You get the idea, just try every possible way. If you are lucky like me, you will finally see a charging icon, this means the device is finally pulling in power!

3)After you see the charging icon, let it be for a little bit, then try to turn it on. It should boot up just fine. Now, when you are not using the device, put it in airplane mode, so that battery doesn't die too fast, or just always leave it on the charger, this is a known issue with the 2012 nexus, and it is a pain! But this is the bet fix for this problem.",0.9382,331

"This happened to my S8+ 3 months ago.  Call Samsung for replacement. (Was sent two,after first didn't charge) 
Def didn't ""repair"" my device as it had distinct scratches by usb port from VRheadset. More than helpful. If they couldn't fix,they'd replace. If they couldn't replace, I could have been bought out  completely. 

 DO NOT GO TO SAMSUNG EXPERIENCE in NYC. They claimed it was corroded on the inside, ""likely due to mist in bathrooms."" Samsung phone rep even said how ridiculous that was.

A. Sprint isn't to blame. Also with them, completely circumvented them.
B. Lost deals? You can't sue for any ""lost wages,"" that's a risk of early adopting.

This is actually normal behavior with almost all batteries.  The protection circuitry sees zero voltage and thinks the battery is faulty so it won't charge it.  Ran into this years ago on Eneloop and laptop rechargeable batteries.  Just don't completely drain the battery so that means when it auto shutdown to not repeatedly force it to power on unplugged which will completely drain it.,-0.3182,68

"What does Sprint customer service have to do with anything? You have a manufacturers warranty. There is a one year warranty-go to another for Sprint dealer. You say that Samsung makes a bad device-they sure do. Think of the volume of phones they produce. Goodness-everything cannot be perfect. I was in business for 10 years and had hardware failures on new machines, manufacturers will never reimburse for lost time. Take out an insurance policy for things like this. People whine about everything. Part of being in business for yourself is assuming the risk-that is why it isn't for everyone. If you had another phone and failed to immediately bring it back in service while you tried to recover the Note then shame on you. When I worked for myself I always had backup. So you mean to tell me that your only communication to your ""deals"" is voice? No voicemail, email, text, etc? I always had backup plans. Sounds like to me your just wanting to complain about your lack of planning. If I only had phone problems when I worked for myself I would have jumped up and down for joy. Throw multiple employees, sensitive electronic equipment that cost min $8k to repair everytime it broke and then the down time. I NEVER once go reimbursed and still had to write paychecks on Friday.
 As a business ower it is your responsibility to be prepared. I challenge you to do so. In the time it took to record this video and whine about your phone you could have been making forward progress and been productive in coming to a temporary solution for your ""deals"". That is what responsible people do-they don't whine and hope a fairy will drop out of the sky and fix everything. Don't hand me the garbage about what you paid for the device-get it warrantied and move on. Nothing is perfect! The sooner you realize that the better off you will be. It is called being an adult. I also own a phone that touches $1000, if it screws up I will hold the manufacturer to honoring the warranty (obviously if in that period). I recognize that things aren't always flawless.",-0.967,409
What happened to the Samsung manufacturer warranty?,0.0,8
What i was doing in the video was what samsung tech suppprt told me to do.... im pretty sure a number of people let there phone drain all the way to 0%  because they either didnt have a charger or didnt have anywhere to plug it in.. My note 5 had no problems draining and charging...  Insurance lol i have never paid for insurance since the s5 came out.  People who need insurance are most likely clumsy people or people who dont take care of their phone. I ran into a few phones with manufacture defects and of course i trust the 1 year warranty. Sprint sold me a lemon phone. It was about 3 weeks old and i still had a chance to purchase it becaude it wasn't past the 30 day period. But even if i had insurance sprint still would have charged me $75 for a replacement. Why in the Fk would i pay them $75 for a defective phone? Outcome of this.. i paid full price for a refurbish phone.,-0.1098,189
