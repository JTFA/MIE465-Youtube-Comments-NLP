9 suitcases... I would have asked her how she manages to get them all to her place of residence for those 6 months. Is that one cab? Two cabs?  I'm guessing she needed at least one cart to load them all up on and move them. She probably got a private pick up in an escalade or something.,0.0,64

Friends, trust and rest in this love! 

He will save you from your sins, He will deliver you from your bondages, but most importantly you will be forgiven.

He will also make a Way for us to escape the oncoming judgement that is headed towards this earth. He already took our punishment upon Himself on the cross, so He already made a Way to escape! Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!

The Lord promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him. So please come to Him today, friends.
