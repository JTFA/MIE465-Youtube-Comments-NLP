This song is amazing and everytime I listen to it I get a strange feeling that makes my heart beat so fast. Maybe it is because I like it so much. The chorus reminds me of another song but I dont know the name of it. I have heard that sound on many movies at the ending. Does anyone know songs like this one??,0.7657,70

"Well after reviewing the voice performance I am happy to find out that your goung with vloves now. Despite the streaming capablities and that I never bought an full album of any artist, I would buy one of yours. Keep it up! I like how you are working with your voice  and ofc the songs too. If you ever read this I wanna thank you.",0.8777,71
"What was I thinking
Trying to put words in your mouth
I should just leave it
And let you figure it out

It's louder in the silence
As I try, I try
To keep it together
But you're bringing the house down

I can see it burning out
And I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you
Feel it burning out
And I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning

What were you thinking
I gave you the perfect out
You didn't believe it
That we could turn it around

Show me that it matters
And I'll try, I'll try
Too keep it together
But you're bringing the house down

I can see it burning out
And I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you
Feel it burning out
And I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning
Feel it burning out
And I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you
Feel it burning out
And I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning

I've let it go once or twice
I've let it go even though my feelings were right
And now I know it's hard to fight
Now I know you came at the wrong time

I can see it burning out
And I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you
Feel it burning out
And I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning
I can feel it burning out
And I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you
Feel it burning out
And I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning

And I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning",-0.8788,281

"Yes, she does sound like someone else. That's not a normal speaking accent for a white person. Why would she shift into someone else's voice when singing? Why doesn't she just sing as herself, with her own voice? Would you record a voicemail message using a British or French accent for no apparent reason?",0.5484,61
