"@VisionRouge Shaghai - did you read the description of the video?  It clearly said, ""...However, the truck driver sitting on the pavement opposite to the trail didn't do anything when hearing the horn from the train.""  The driver knew the train was coming.  It wasn't the videographer's job to warn him.",0.3182,60

Apparently the train tracks nor the air horn wasn't warning enough? How do you suppose cameraman locate and warn the dumbass truck driver?,-0.5145,25

"Come on VC people.  You know truck vs train, train always wins.",0.5719,15
Do you know how train works? He blows the horn cuz he cant brake and stop immediately and he cannot know or see if any is on the rails before it`s to late. He wasnt warning the driver but everyone and if the truck was not empty the driver would`ve been ran over..,0.431,60

I thought it looked better after the train hit it.,0.4404,11
"I was a train conductor on electric and diesel trains, in my spare time i would drive steam locs for a museum line.
If he had applied the emergency brake you would instantly hear the air escape, just like the sound of an air compressor on a semi truck that has to much pressure and blows it off with a short burst. It is then also impossible to apply more breaking as the brakes go into full braking mode when emergency braking is activated, this can not be stopped nor regulated once applied. 
Didn't hear the air escape but i did hear him apply more breaking so no, no emergency braking there, only manual breaking and only after it had hit the car a few times.",-0.9247,135

Yes, exactly.
The train hit the truck 30 seconds after the video start, I guess the moron who record it also took tome time to realize that a train was coming and thought about recording a video of the coming catastrophe. 
He may have spend 10 extra seconds on this thinking and walk back to get the best angle instead of warning the driver. 
The driver almost got killed trying to his truck out of the way, and no help from the stupid phone holder, just keep recording (in portrait mode btw)
