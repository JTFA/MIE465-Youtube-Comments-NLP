"I'm partway through the Gaga documentary on Netflix, and it got to a part where Lady Gaga played this song to her gran about her daughter. I had to come out and play the whole thing here to hear the lyrics in full. It's just had me in floods of tears- coz this song means something to me, too. It's what i would say to my own baby that i lost. I lost my baby through an ectopic pregnancy, but i always believed my baby was a girl. Her heart was beating inside me, and i will never forget watching that on a scan. And she will be 7 years old next month in heaven.",0.273,127

"This song has always touched my heart in the deepest and most poetic of ways, since the first time that I heard her sing it. Though the original is quite melodic and beautiful, I will always choose the piano version of her songs, because that's her true nature as an artist and a musician. That's where her soul lies, and... it never fails to bring tears to my eyes. Thank you for writing this, not only for your family in memory of Joanne, but for all of the people in the world who have had someone close to them pass on too soon. Your music will forever touch my spirit. Thank you for your art, Stefani, thank you for your soul.",0.9144,136
