"*Nintendo, I love this game so much, I can't stand the thought that there's nothing more to come! Please consider the following ideas for one last (paid?) DLC:*

Something I believe could be easliy applied and really change the dynamic would be a *much smaller inventory* , allowing you to only carry a handful of armors and weapons. Also having less materials with you would mean a little more planning on which area you will go next or which fights to pick.

A *thougher economy system* would make it harder for players to buy loads of arrows and materials, really bringing out the survival aspect. *Destructable armor* would add to that, since you'd have to constantly buy them anew. You could even go so far as to make *fast travel cost rubins or items* , forcing you to think twice if a fast travel is really worth it. The farther you'd want to fast travel, the higher the cost. Add randomly generated *infinite recurring quests* from NPCs, who will pay you. These could be monster hunts or material gathering, for example.

And last but not least, since everyone loves Eventide Island, make the *blood moon nights strip you of all inventory items and allow no saving* , so you have to survive the night. If you die, you only get a fraction of your equipment back.

I believe these changes or additions would make the wait for a sequel so much more endurable for us. :)",0.7651,286

i love BotW but to me the dungeons, bosses and shrines were lackluster, yes the divine beasts were fun to mess around with but most took 15 to 30 minutes to complete, very few shrines were actually ""challenging"" let alone hard to find i didn't even have to use the ""shrine detector"" to find them, just pure good old fashion curiosity exploration and understanding the clues given to me by NPCs. Also they missed the chance off giving us the ""Hookshot"" on the 2nd DLC. BotW would off been the perfect game for that weapon, yes ik it destroys the concept off climbing but it's not like it can hook to just anything, trees or anything made off wood only which not every climb had plus most mountains were pretty big so the reach would never really get you to the top alone.

"Wish List for the next Zelda game:

Return to Termina (for some reason, I find it more interesting than Hyrule)

More dungeon theme variety (the shrine‚Äôs constant blue and orange metallic feel gets old after doing it 120 times)

More old enemies (Stalfos, Darknut, Bubble, Mad Scrub)

Deku Scrub society, like in MM (they‚Äôve been ignored too long)

More music themes, instead of a few piano notes (maybe with a different them for each section of the map?)

More collectibles, but with less abundance (900 KOROK SEEDS!)

Darker story

Transformations (like Wolf Link, Minish Cap, Masks)

Completionist Bonus

What do you guys want in the next game?",0.755,138

You know that everyone in the LoZ fanbase like arguing about the confounding timeline showing three different scenarios of Link. So is the timeline really a smokescreen to drive away the fact that the LoZ franchise is just the retelling of the legend passing through future generations?,-0.128,49
You should add a DLC that adds Dungeons!!!!! Every Zelda game has them except this one! Shrines don‚Äôt count there not dungeons! The only thing close to a dungeon is Hyrule Castle! Plz make sure there‚Äôs dungeons in the next Zelda game!!,0.5815,54
