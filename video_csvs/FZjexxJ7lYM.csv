Because, guess what, as great as KD is (and he's the best in the league right now to me, bar none), if he gets severely injured, he could get shipped anywhere without his approval because he doesn't have a no trade clause, especially if the goal is to sign someone of LeBron's caliber. So yes, players should take ALL the money they can take every single time and get these NTC when they can. Power is not to be surrendered.

Willie Reed and Brice Johnson, GTFO in 2.5 months. Blake has another 3-year sentence. Blake is still getting paid ALOT but one phone call that didn't happen makes the Clippers look classless. Man, fuck that low class Jerry West since he's part of that classless organization! 😂 

That's what happens when you don't take winning or basketball seriously, you shoot Kia commercials, you get injured alot, you punched an equipment manager who ended up getting fired, you hated CP3 who wanted to win so badly more than you, and you dated Kendall Jenner. You get sent to the most classless organization (Bad Boys '91 walkoff) and classless fans (Malice in the Palace) ever that won two championships being cheapshot artists and incited a brawl five months after their 3rd title. 

Summer 2021 can't come soon enough for Blake. He wants to GTFO the moment he stepped onto Detroit. Forgot to wear his Piston jersey momentarily last night. That's how badly Blake wants out of there. He'll get his real Clipper jersey retirement and statue outside of the new arena in Inglewood once he retires. Welcome him back in the next decade. Take care, buddy.

So teams can make a player work even when they've had injuries and thats all about making them play a little smarter and less high risk plays but more smart basketball plays. With his athleticism that he still has quite a bit of Blake should be fine, it just comes down to how well the medical staff takes care of him and how well VG utilizes his on the court.

This is not a white black thing in my opinion but you clearly think it is for some reason. Dwight Howard also absolutely tried to get SVG fired, this is well documented and easily googleable. SVG has led both the Heat and Magic to NBA Finals and upset the Cavs in ECF. He has had good records in the past and Riley took out SVG to coach Heat because SVG and Shaq didn't get along. Ultimately, the right choice since talent and chemistry trump coaching and they won it all that year. Drummond has been an all star only under SVG and that was 4 years into his career. I watched him from his Huskies days and he is a very inconsistent player that like DJ could not play in 4th quarters cuz he was a 40% ft shooter. The pistons missed the playoffs for 7 straight years before SVG. They were 29-53 before Stan got there. These are facts not opinions. Now, in my opinion, based on the evidence, SVG is a very good coach and below average executive. We've seen it with Doc Rivers, Thibs, and now SVG. Coaches should not have executive powers. They have too much going on and are short-sighted. I hope Pistons fans will have some excitement with Griffin going forward though.",0.9815,287

Laughing at all the hate. Let these Lakertards forget how great Jerry West is. He isn't sabotaging. Clippers don't need that in him anyway. 

Fuck the LA(ker) Times. Hilarious what level of idiot comments I read from there. Only took FOUR years for Jerry West to make the Lakers a champion from 1996. Another three years for Warriors from 2012. 

Too many dumb motherfuckers don't understand the power of location, money, and The Logo. Lakers rebuilding for five years and still won't make the Playoffs and no draft picks this summer in a loaded draft.

Clippers' culture needs to change and change now. Nobody is beating the Warriors in the next two years. Nomore soft shit, injury-prone, and chokers anymore.
