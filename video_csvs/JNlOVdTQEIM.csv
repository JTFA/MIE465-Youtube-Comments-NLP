And that reason is so you don't disturb other people or get in the way of other people's rights and Logan was breaking the laws by throwing plush pokeballs at people, disrespecting someones dead hanging family member, ect.",-0.95,109

We speak Chinese, so we turned to him and asked why he keeps on following us around and harassing us.

"EPIC SAWIKI i understand what you‚Äôre saying. And yes music from the early 2000s was very decent, now its high pitched computer sounds and auto tuned voices. I love japanese/kawaii music, its a very unique and cute kind of music that is very fascinating to me, in my opinion lol. We‚Äôre fantastic at movies and what not, but i recently saw a video about how Canada enforcing LGBT into their elementary school system. They were having evil looking drag queens come a read homosexual stories to the children, and the teacher told a little girl ‚Äúyou could be a boy trapped inside a girls body‚Äù, because she was playing a boys doll. And at the beginning of class, they sing a ‚Äúrainbow‚Äù song that depicts ‚Äúsome girls like catching snakes and some boys like dessing up‚Äù. Aside that, I fear it may one day invade America. Social media is another terrible issue, its persuaded an entire nation of people to what is displayed on social media in terms of fashion and ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù.

but i would say sorry after that 
""gomenasai i didnt ment to be rude its just normal in my homecountry""

And i mean what he did isnt nice in germany as well. It also would be rude but at least german people simply would yell at him and inslut him. Not only the yung generatin the older ones would too.

ANd thats where the diference kick in.
I really like how shy and well behaved japanese people are. But. Thats the reason why he was able to get this far not a single person was ""brave"" enought to tell him how to behave and that THIS is verry rude and offensive.

If i was there i had told him even if I get kicked out of the temple as well.

"Not an actual response to your comment but still: I am from Switzerland and on the Swiss website that informs people on whether or not it is safe to travel to a specific country (the website where you can for example look up if country x is a safe country to travel to and might find out that in general it is mostly safe to go there apart from rather often recurring earth quakes and that in the past months there have been large groups of trick thieves operating in and around the capital that get moderately violent in very rare cases, I don't know what it is called in English) it says very clearly that you have to do what the cops in the United States tell you. That you have to follow their orders very strictly. So far I have never seen such a statement regarding another country on this website. So cops in the United States should be even less fucked with than cops in other places.",-0.9403,178

Of course Logan videos are full of stupidity. I didn't like his videos. Stabbing teddy bears smashing dishes plates and screaming like mentally ill person calling woman bitches. This thing in the forest he did is unforgiving. Yet he's channel is still online and you tube paying him a lot of money. How can it be. Fraudulent you tube is on his side because his channel is making money for them so fells untouchable. Forgive me my language but fuck Logan and fuck him. I never liked his personality and now I literary witch he is going to be take of from Internet. His apology video is disgusting and fake.

"Okay I have a question about Japanese culture.

In America, even tossing a soft pokeball at a cop like at 6:57 is likely to result in a pretty extreme reaction. An arrest is likely to happen and, depending on the area, it would be an extremely painful one. Prosecution, though, would not necessarily happen. There's a good chance they would be released with a warning or a fine so long as they didn't brawl with the police or commit any other crimes.

How would it go down in Japan? Would the arrest lead to a severe conviction? Would he be released with a warning? What do you think of criminal justice where you live?",-0.6505,128

"Omg. I‚Äôve NEVER seen his videos, but everyone has told me about them. I refuse to give him the views. When I lived in Japan back in 2008-2011, I was always reminded by my employer that I was a representative of America, anyone coming from a foreign country is thus a representative of their country. Americans I think are always closely watched in Japan because of the military bases. Logan Paul does a great job of making Americans look trashy, disrespectful, and dishonorable.",0.5927,96

"Personally, I don't agree with a lot of what the Japanese lady was saying in that segment of the video. I don't think it's because Logan Paul sees us (foreigners) as a ""child"" or doesn't see us as the same level as him as a human being. I think it's mainly just that he is ignorant and has no respectful for others, differing cultures, and himself. I say this because he doesn't act this way only to Japanese people or foreign people. He does this explicitly in the US. It's not a matter of believing in inferiority, it's just lack of respect and intelligence. I'm from Japan too and I'm honestly angered that someone can be this disrespectful towards another country's culture.",0.0041,137

"That is just disrespectful, even if he blurred the face of the poor victim, showing the corpse to the public, making fun of the corpse and other horrible things is just so disrepectful. He even had the guts to go to a japanese temple. He is too disrespectful. He's old enough! He should act like his age. He's not  a kid. But, if he still acts like that, I believe he needs adult supervision. Jumping and clinging to a moving vehicle and distracting the driver? If something bad happens to them, the driver will be blamed. And the fact that he even put the fish and the red thing (idk what it's called) on the taxi is just so rude! And the taxi driver might be embarrassed because tons of people saw that, his passenger probably saw that. Throwing pokeballs under a car, and in a bicycle basket? What did your parents fed you when you are still a kid? I mean, I don't really hate him. I just find it so.. disrespectful, rude. He is old enough! And for those who hate this Japanese Man Named Yuta, he is just stating his opinions. So am I.
