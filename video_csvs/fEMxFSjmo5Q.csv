"8 minutes in and I haven't been this frustrated by a video since Rhett and Link tried moving as slow as slow animals. She made it waaaayyyy harder than it needed to be! Another commenter was right about injecting the center while it was still malleable. This should've had a stuffed doughnut approach and not relied on a half-mold. Not that I'd know, but it just makes sense and I've done cooking, baking and once made hard candy, so I'm not a kitchen novice either.",-0.5255,93
"A factory that makes gummies, uses flour molds. I mean that they press the negative shape of the candy in a lot of flour with a molde that has the positive shape of it, and when de gummie is ready it is easier to obtain de whole gummie from the flour than from a solid mold.
In order to get shiny gummies, they add wax :)",0.8316,71

"When making sticky candy that you don’t want to stick to the mold, use baking soda. Put the baking soda in a shallow baking pan, press the mold into it and use the holes made by the mold in the baking soda to put the sticky candy liquid into the holes. With baking soda molds you only need one plastic or metal mold to use over and over again and you can just reuse the baking soda as much as you need. The sticky liquid will harden and not get stuck so no need for partial melting. 😁👍",-0.2086,107

"reduce the juice with a lot of sugar, lay out a cookie tray a good inch deep in corn starch, add little drops of the sugar juice onto the corn starch and cover these back up with more corn starch and let sit and dry for awhile (check after every hour).  They will get a very thin layer of hardened sugar on the outside while staying gooey in the middle, allowing you to handle them and should be like an inside of a gusher but better tasting.  This is how old school liquor chocolates were formed in the middle.",0.7615,107
