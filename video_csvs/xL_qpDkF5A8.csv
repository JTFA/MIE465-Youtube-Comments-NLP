"I was actually working for Versace in the same time frame. I was a Boss Model, Mens Division and during his murder, I was on a campaign for Versace Couture Jeans. In addition, I have been to a party at his mansion among several parties at Club Liquid, South Beach, and Club Bash and the Stage, NY City. I can remember how he treated people, I was personally met by G Versace at the DB dungaree clothing store on South Beach. He walked right up to me and said, so, are you a model. I said, as matter of fact, I am. He said I like you, who, wow, wow,  that was exactly what I heard. Then, he says, who is your booker, I told him, Boss men Miami and NY,. He said you will hear from me. He was wearing a black T-shirt, rolled up sleeves with blue jean shorts, I swear to god, looked like he was wearing Dazy Dukes. lol. He was walking a British bull-dog.  his family and him, they were nasty people, they talked down to everyone, esp that filthy pig of a sister. They always had local wise-guys there at there parties so in short, I am not surprised and from what I saw, if Andrew didn't do it, someone else would, they were just too​ nasty to people to get away with.",0.873,274
