Really? Is Terry Crews, a man with a wife and 5 children, gay? Is Terry Crews, a 6ft3in tall/245lb heavy former football player, ""like a woman""? I can't believe you're assuming that they're gay just because they were sexual harassment victims. It's that homophobic, sexist mentality that paints men as ""weak and feminine"" because they were humiliated, harassed or raped that prevents so many men of suing and speaking out against the abuser when that happens to them.

Please, if you want to have a debate, let's be honest here. Let's try to comprehend what the people on the video are saying to avoid misunderstandings, because it's not productive to put words into someone else's mouth. She never, in any part of the video, said that it's all men who rape, or that all rapists are men or that you are all monsters. Yes, she said ""I know what men can do when they are angry"", but not ""I know what men WILL do when they are angry"", and thus, wan't being as deterministic as you suggested. Do you even know why she said that? Do you know her story? Do you know the context behind the phrase? If you don't, then it's pointless to act as if you understood it, when it seems like you didn't. And yes, sharing the story of men who where also victims proves that they are not being dehumanized. Actually, if you want to give me a convincing evidence of why the video is dehumanizing men, suit yourself, because this statement is clearly not enough and wasn't as ill intended and discriminatory as you were saying it was.
And in no way I'm telling you it's wrong to raise your voice about inequality (it's exactly what TIME is doing here, after all). But protesting in a youtube video that covers sexual harassment (of both men and women) isn't the best way to spread awareness about the problems men face in society. And please, are you really telling me that men don't hold most of the economical and political power in our society? You'd be lying if you said women share the same amount of influence. (Of course, after that, you could send me whichever articles on sexual determinism and dimorphism in humans, but honestly: don't even bother. Even if some of the biological differences between men and women could explain a disparity, simply saying ""biology"" isn't enough. You can't say that women are only 26% as worthy as men of being in STEM fields. You can't say that women are 20% as capable as men of being a politician. You can't say that women only deserve 4% of the positions as CEOs. Ignoring that there's sexism and systemic inequality towards women is bullshit).
You don't want me to act like you are ""too stupid to watch the video""? Fine, I won't. Then don't act like I'm too stupid to understand what that woman meant by that phrase. Don't act like I'm too stupid to understand the contradiction in your comment (you are saying ""don't generalize"", at the same time you are generalizing the feminists as ""men haters"" because of something you think a woman, that isn't even a feminist leader, said in a video). Don't act like I'm too stupid to understand that saying men hold most of the power in our society is discrimination, and not a fact.",-0.9786,566

"Don't get me wrong, I do want to support these women. Again, I have a lot of respect for them that they stood up and spoke out. Sexual harrassment is a terrible thing that should be fought. I want to fight it, and I will happily support anybody that stands up and fights against it. My intention was not to nitpick, and I'm sorry if I gave off that feeling. I wanted to bring this up because this is not the first time I've seen, or at least felt like men were generalised in the way I described. Even if that was not the intention here, I have seen it happen before.

I am not doubting or discrediting her experience or pain in any way. I can't imagine how painful it must be to be a victim of sexual assault, and I am incredibly sorry for all of these women that they have had and still have to go through that. I just wanted to bring this up because the comment from Dr. Walsh specifically just did not come across to me that way. I will fully agree with you this is a matter of interpretation. I am just afraid that other people may interpret this message the way I interpreted it, and may actually believe that wrong message too. Even if it was not the intent here, discrimination against men by for example social justice warriors is a problem, and to me this quote came across as a statement supporting these crazy ideas: the idea that ""only men can commit such crimes"" or ""men are biologically this way."" Because even if men have the capacity to be terrible, women have that too. After all, sexual assault can happen in a lot more ways than just through brute force.

I will not deny this was very likely not her intention when she said this, and again, I am not trying to discredit her problems in any way. I can't imagine the pain she and other victims have gone through, and I want to and will help fight sexual assault. It's a terrible thing no person should ever have to suffer through. I brought up this point because I want to prevent all wrong ways of thinking, and I was afraid that that message, when misinterpreted, could just replace one wrong way of thinking with another.",-0.9024,438

"I disagree with your comment for a few different reasons. Firstly, sexual abuse is a serious matter that does NOT include the wide spectrum your comment insinuates. The legal definition of sexual abuse is as follows;
a : the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by forcible compulsion
b : the engaging in sexual contact with a person who is below a specified age or who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity
As you can see, this does not in any way include ""simply looking at a woman the wrong way."" Now, what you may be referencing is sexual harassment which is different. Sexual harassment includes a broader spectrum, defined as harassment in a workplace, or other professional or social situation, involving the making of unwanted sexual advances or obscene remarks. Once again, your hyperbolic statement that this term could refer to a man looking at a woman the wrong way is simply not the case. I do understand that you were simply exaggerating in order to get your point across, but nonetheless your claims were disputable. 

The second part of your comment was unnecessary and almost unrelated to your first. You seem to be dealing with personal issues and relaying your anger on the internet. Seeing as this is most likely the case, and your comments on the subject are quite unrealistic and insignificant, I feel no need to leave further opinions on them. 

Finally, your first claim. Now, yes, the statute of limitations for sexual abuse has been lifted where I live, and yes it is possible for the crime to be punished many many years after it is committed. Yes, a man (or woman!) would potentially lose everything if convicted of rape. However, I would hope that our legal systems are strong enough that nobody would get thrown in jail because of ""something that allegedly happened 20-30 years ago,"" and that the fact of whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty would be considered! Of course there are issues with the system, and no, I don't defend any mistakes or wrong accusations that have occurred, but for the most part I think that criminal matters are extensively considered, and in the end decisions that could cause someone to ""lose everything"" are made only with evidence. Once it is determined that a person is guilty of sexual abuse, they 100 percent deserve to pay for their crime just as much as they did when the committed it, no matter if it has been 20 years. 

I don't necessarily identify as a feminist, simply a female who is against men making rash, uneducated comments on the internet that bash women who are finally beginning to find the courage to use their voice in a world that has been dominated by male presence and opinion for far too many years.",-0.9969,531

I am very glad these women have opened up about this and I am very glad to see victims of sexual harrassment opening up and not only demanding, but receiving justice, because that's the very least they deserve.

However, I do want to bring up one thing that bothers me about this video, and that can be found at 1:45. ""I know what men can do when they're angry."" This line really bothers me. This line is essentially stating that all men can rape women if they get angry enough. It's generalising all men as rapists, and I take serious issue with this. Now don't get me wrong, sexual harrassment is a terrible thing, and I realise women get harrassed more often than men statistically speaking. However, that doesn't change men also get harrassed, and women also harras. But this is ignored in favour of stating how it's apparently natural for men to harrass women. After all, ""she knows what men can do when they're angry."" 

Look, sexual harrassment is a horrible thing that should be prevented at all costs. But this goes both ways. The sexual harrassment of men is just as bad as the harrassment of women, and women can also harrass. And while I obviously agree the ridiculous idea of ""A woman can ask for being harrassed"" or ""They should just take it"" or anything like that is absolute bullshit and an unacceptable way of thinking in any way, you can't fix that wrong way of thinking about women by replacing it with a wrong way of thinking about men. You don't fix a thought like ""All women should accept being raped"" by reversing it to ""All men are rapists."" You don't fix the problems of women by making men the enemy. The very vast majority of men agree that sexual harrassment is unacceptable in any form, but by stating ""you know what men can do when they're angry"" you're changing the problem from women being scared of talking about being harrassed to men feeling worried to attempt even the slightest social interaction because ""what if they see me as a rapist?"". 

Again, sexual harrassment is a terrible thing I wish would not exist in this world, and action should be taken and I'm glad it is. But if you take action, do it fairly. Attack the rapists, don't attack all men for it. That is generalisation, and that is bad. That's like saying all women are emotional wrecks because statistically they're more likely to have mental issues than men. It's a bad and damaging stereotype that's simply not true and very hurtful to all women, just like suggesting something like ""all men can be rapists"" is to men.",-0.9972,589
"Oh, you know what men can do, to women, when they're angry? At least women are completely incapable of doing bad things.
