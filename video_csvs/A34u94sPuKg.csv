"Life here on earth is temporary do you know where you will go when you die? For sure you are going to hell, why? Because you are a sinner.

This is the second death.” (Revelation 21:8) Probably you are one of those list or maybe all. But good news there is a solution to the problem, JESUS is the solution. "" For GOD so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him will not die but have eternal life."" (John 3:16), ""I (JESUS) am the WAY, the TRUTH and the LIFE, NO ONE comes to the Father except through me."" (John 14:6). Jesus is the Son of God. He is the saviour of the world. He died for your sins, he was buried but 3 days later he rose from the dead because he is the GOD. He loves you and want to be with you forever and ever. Repent (Change, Surrender, Hate the SIN) and Believe (Trust, Faithful) in the LORD JESUS CHRIST and you will be saved. Friend, the LORD JESUS changed my life. He set me free and he continues to build and transform me. This is world is full of deception, sin, corruption, hate, killing, gossips, etc. I thought there is no hope in this world until I encounter JESUS. He is real and he loves you.

TheTlewis3074 of course KD played great but that means 0 when your teammates are Klay and Curry who could put up 40 themselves easily which spreads the floor like no one has ever seen. KD maybe an A+ player but you don't get that much credit when you join an A team. It's like scoring 100% on a test while your grade is 92%. Sure you went up from 92% to 96% maybe but you're not the great savior,0.9773,88

This is the equivilant of saying an A+ in algebra one is smarter than an A- in Calculus. Not only does LeBron outperform KD individually but KD's stats are in an unchallenging environment. Ask yourself how the Cavs would be if you swapped the 2,0.25,49
This was a great game and matchup between the 2 best players in league who ever you feel is better know is your opinion but imma kd fan not a warriors and I support kd I'm not the biggest LeBron fan but i respect but us as NBA fans must know kd is taking over as best player in league by the end of this season and you have to respect just like we did kobe pass the torch and as LeBron passes it to kd and so on let's respect kd and what he brings to the game,0.9856,99

Also look at how well the Celtics are doing without Hayward. The Cavs gave up Kyrie for an injured I.T. it’s almost like they don’t want to be good,0.6808,71

We cant put into words how retarded you kids sound. 1 faggot on this threat explain to me, WHAT YOU SAW that night or this season that said ""Cupcake is better RIGHT NOW"". Put some respect on LeBron name for ONCE, talking like -14 was the plus minus when he hit the bench end of the 3rd?? The Cavs couldnt make shit in the 4th, while KD team scored w/o him.

Again I shouldnt even have to type out what happen, b/c it happened last night so im not, but for real y'all get on the internet the next day, talking reckless and completely saying the opposite to get 2 LIKES.
