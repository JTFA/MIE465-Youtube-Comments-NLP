"Google Rupert Murdoch. Then research the big 5 studios in Hollywood. (((Rupert))) owns most of the worlds news outlets. The big 5 have always been owned by (((jews))).

The stats are AMAZING! 13% of the US population (blacks) commit 51% of the murders and 53% of violent robberies. Yet Hollywood churns out movie after movie showing the evil white man, and the poor black victim...thus pushing whites to hate themselves and blacks to hate whites...a vicious cycle, while Israel laughs. To many prominent jews have called for the destruction of Europe and America. Try this telling little trick - type in these two words into your reply, use lower case letters - christian and jew  Now tell me, Did auto correct underline both words as incorrect for not being capitalized...or just jew?
