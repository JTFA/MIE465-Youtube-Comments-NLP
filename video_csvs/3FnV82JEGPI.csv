Dang, cant write anymore and people are falling asleep reading my sh*t , it is way too long, but I hope you dont feel like the idiot after you read it and just say sorry and go forward with your chin held up high, now empowered to inform others, waking them up one at a time, but do know this whole thing goes back to Bush and the NeoCons... Clinton is a NeoCon, Obama really was not, I beleive, even though I did not like Obama's policies and beliefs, I think he was not a neocon... I am not sure what he was, I am not sure why he had a fake birth certificate as now documented by the two top independent forgery forensics experts in the world, used by law enforcement world wide, one is in Italy, cant remember where the other is, but they are completely independent. Many people dont know this amd have not watched the 2 hour press conference where law enforcement showed an abundance of evidence and proof that not only was the BC fraudulent, they found the two real BC used to make the one and also discovered Obama social security number and select service card fake... so I dont know what to make of it, it is possible it was something as simple as he wanted early on to be shown born in USA, but he fake documents on the other hand does not prove Obama was born anywhere, it is just fake documents and that is it. So he very well could have been born here. His real father is that guy who was making pornos with his mother, so she ran off with an indigenous African to cover for her whoring around and subsequently it back fired, but that is a theory. There is a lot of evidence and it is something the CIA deep state would do and that is to take a level 5 extreme NPD and create a Manchurian Candidate, but this gets close to the aliens and reptiles are really in charge, in many peoples mind, so I will stop right there because I dont want people to send me tin foil in the mail like before; I still have half a garage full of the stuff and Walmart wont allow any more returns from me, as a matter of fact, they called the police last time and I didn't even do anything.

I was in law enforcement and this is so way beyond any question, it is prima facie... if a text message says ""POTUS wants"" that means the president wants, you cant say what evidence when it is spelled out in front of your face. The Obama, Hillary... et al, obtained counter intelligence on an elected official, it does not matter if it is Trump or Mickey Mouse, it is on its face high crimes and I am only pointing out one thing. People, it is like the police walked in on someone holding a knife and a severed head and saying ""what evidence, what are you talking about, your an idiot""! Serious, is there that much blind anger and mass psychosis happening? My god, the insanity is worse than the crimes. And so you know, they used a fake dossier paid for and created by a Hillary and others, to create a fake narrative of a Russian conspiracy against Trump, which cycled back to friends in the justice department to lie to the court to obtain (buy)  counter intelligence,  this is not myth, it is fact, not because a memo says so, it is the 100 pages they just released that says so and backs up the memo, which was a summary of facts. These are the FBI own facts they also didnt want to release. Now this also shows collusion with Russian agents, not by Trump,  but by Steele, who put together dossier and it shows he recieved what to put in the dossier by Hillary and the DNC, so they are using what Hillary says to put in a dossier,  which was then used as real to obtain counter intelligence! WOW! They lied to the courts every 90 days even into the presidency because the dossier was used each time for renewal and this is even after for FBI director Comedy told Trump the dossier was fake. (He used a different words) 
Just to note something interesting; Comey is either the informant or he is dirty and involved... we won't know this yet until the informant and other information is released, as crazy as it sounds,  I suspect him as ""the informant"" or at least one who maybe clean, which would make Comey one of the greatest American ""hero"" of all time.

"David Brown, More proof that not enough Americans understand what is going on, Obama was elected twice and the fact that Trump was elected at all. 
Obama supported the big corporate finance giants, foreign militants, sex traffickers, and the continuing corruption that has poisoned the American system to this day. Directly and indirectly.
The reason Obama was chosen was because he had no record to run against but he also had no record to run on. He shares that appeal with Trump.
They all need lawyers.
I am not a Republican but I have not seen a Democrat worth supporting in my life time. Mostly because of the core ideology of the party. 
Democrats believe they are elected lead. That is not what the political system of the United States is for.
The united States is a Constitutional Republic, where we elect representatives for the citizens, not leaders.
Unfortunately their education system seems to omit their purpose and the United States has grown several generations of followers seeking leadership. That is why they have become weak and divided.
Waiting outside the gates of their masters for spoils stolen from labors of those who actually earned their independence or were born to persons who earned it for them.
The land of equal opportunity begs for an equal share because they elect for a government  that will steel from their earnings, to buy the blond support of the indoctrinated masses. 
The difference I see between Trumps brand of corruption and the Democrat brand of corruption is that Trumps policies actually require every one to have an opportunity to find greater prosperity in order for the rich to stay rich. The Democrats just dip into the tax payers to save their own wealth and then scrape off what can be rationed.

A right is something you exercise not something that is granted.

I have glaucoma, acromegaly and I have been fighting prostate and colon cancer for the better part of three years. The U.S. government already provides for those that can not provide for themselves. There no reason to create greater provisions for able bodies that are capable of earning that which they need to survive.
How you pursue your happiness is entirely up to you.
Increasing the cost of government does not make healthcare cheaper for anyone.

My cousin had thyroid cancer back in 1996 and the hospital cured it and sent him a bill. His monthly payments were still far less than what my health insurance cost me.
I was paying out of pocket until the Affordable Healthcare Act was passed, which mandated I purchase health insurance. 
It was 125% cheaper for me to buy direct from my healthcare providers.

I have Medicaid now, because I am unable to work after a car accident caused irreparable damage to my spine. It is cheap for me but expensive for the tax payers, and it is difficult to find health care providers that are reputably competent and accept the Medicaid plan.
 I wouldn't need it if our education system would have taught me before I entered into employment, that I could have purchased a healthcare savings account or similar services that are available through the private market. 
Home economics or what ever they are calling the course nowadays should be teaching students how to engage in markets that are favorable toward future expenses.
The expansion of markets increases competition and decrease cost while reducing government dependency.
I don't like idea of the government campaigning to sell me legislation especial when it concerns personal care. Codependency is a terrible disorder that many parents go through, I don't think we need a representative government with the same disorder. We just need stronger people.",0.8585,371

The laws have been equal for every citizen for a long time. 

Honestly I ignored that the Jackass party fought against nearly every civil rights advancement until the later part of the 1970's, at which time everything that needed to be done had been done. 

I know the Republicans are corrupt, but at least their brand of corruption results in net gains for the citizenry.
I know it lacks the panache of selling defense secrets to China, or Uranium Russia, or even weapons, money and supplies to foreign militants in middle east, but it is more fun than giving billions of dollar on a pallet to Iran, bailing out financial institutions that would have been parted and sold to upstart corporations, or trying to nationalize healthcare like some sort of fascist regime.
Sure it's rough to hear Trump say every one gets to keep more of their money so they have a greater incentive to earn more and expand markets, instead of just giving a select few corporations billions of tax payer funds, but the over all out come a greater benefit to those of us who aren't bankers or third world war lords.",0.9633,338

The greatest divide right now is over illegal immigration and illegal occupants with in the U.S..

However there are a number of representatives from certain districts that believe by representing foreign infiltrators they will gain favor with in the communities that have gain a substantial population growth through the process of illicit passage into the U.S..
So the concern was or is that the Democrat party will encumber the immediate progress afforded to the citizenry by refusing funding that may resolve some immigration issues, which causes a stalemate, and a shut down.
It's really just another reason why the U.S. desperately needs greater border securities and stronger immigration enforcement. With out such resolutions the issue will continue to divide their political representation, their people, and their strengths.

"The scientific explanation for these streaks. Jet engines spew out very hot air. And, because water vapor is one of the byproducts of the exhaust, the air is also very humid. However, high in the atmosphere where these jets fly, the air is typically very cold -- often lower than -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, the atmosphere up there is often of low vapor pressure, or the force exerted by a gas on the surrounding environment.
When a jet engine is spewing out hot, humid air into an atmosphere that is cold and has low vapor pressure, the result is condensation. The water vapor coming out of the engine quickly condenses into water droplets and then crystallizes into ice. The ice crystals are the clouds that form behind the engine. This is why the streaks are called contrails, short for ""condensation trails."" To help explain it, scientists liken it to seeing your breath on cold days. You may have noticed that puffs of breath dissipate quickly on drier days. The same is true of contrails: When the atmosphere is more humid, the contrails linger, but when the atmosphere is dry, the contrails disappear more quickly.
The trails also often contain by products such as hydrocarbons.

Everything else is theoretical and has yet to have been proven.

When it comes to theories one must always consider how a manufactured event may benefit some one or some collective and who it may benefit most.

An easy example may be war profiteering conspiracies, such as the Iraq. People will say the Bush's did either for the oil to encumber oil supplies form competing source for an ally. Because the Bush's are invested in petroleum.
Similarly the targets of military actions under Clinton and Obama (more than I care to list. Look them up if you care), were more often than not regions where opium is the most profitable resource, and of course many of their parties leaders are invested in pharmaceuticals. Which is also why some are suspicious of their interest in controlling the distribution and access to health care services. Unless they have an interest in the determination of profits from such resources. 
Additional suspicions were evoked by the how insurers were selected to participate in the Affordable Healthcare Act. Just as corporations were carefully selected when the bailouts were doled out in 2008.

The point I am making is to find a source you need to know what the chemicals are, what they do, where they come from and who benefits from their effects.
Since ""chem trails"" are distributed into the atmosphere we have to assume who ever is responsible is not concerned about what affects they may have on themselves. Unless the perpetrators do not rely on the same atmosphere to breathe of course.

Just thirty years ago we had very little access to information that was not selected for us from a limited perspective. Nowadays there are countless factions offering any number of turns to every tale.

"Was working fine in the U.S. until the government began tampering with it.

Opinions in European nations vary as much as opinions in the U.S.. ""Perfectly fine"" is an over statement. Unless you mean exceptionally thin?

I think it is funny that historically more people have migrated to the U.S. to escape socialism and communism than any other reason, and there are U.S. citizens that actually believe they would prefer those systems of order.
The U.S. had a fair balance of social programs but as they expanded so did the need and demand for social programs. An increasing dependency on government social programs is the antithesis social progress.
Spoken many times those who were witness to demise of the American neighborhood after 1935. Our elders remember a time when neighbors would take care of each other, city blocks came together like families in support of each other because there was no government interventions.
Government social programs have justified the apathetic. We care less about each other because the government will take of us.
Whether it is food, housing or healthcare. The more we add to any system of order the less affordable our freedoms are. 
Social programs are also adverse to the expansion of markets which increase opportunities for future prosperity. 

It should be no surprise that there has been a surge in the number of persons seeking more conservative approaches toward government coming from places like Canada, Germany and U.K...",0.9813,278

"With out a health insurance, healthcare providers will have to lower prices to retain their customers or go out business.
Historically the the expansion of coverage from health insurance has only increased the cost of health care and health care insurance.
The same can be observed from government involvement in just about everything.
At no point in the history of any business transaction has adding a middle man  (third party or more) to a process reduced the overall cost of a service. That is supposed to be common sense.

Look at Obamacare. One the cost increases comes from additional parties that manage the government services like any other brokerage. For the most part that is all it really does is add an extra party to the process and increase cost.
A lot of government programs follow the same campaign and implementation method. 
They campaign scares everyone with the prediction of rising cost. Than they implement a policy that facilitates the need for the increase in the cost and claim it saved us from an even higher cost prediction.
The problem is, some of us actually pay attention and if we speak to persons less hypnotized by partisanship they will make the same observations.
Most of the scare tactics used to promote policies are proven to be false alarms every time we don't allow ourselves to get roped into voting for a savior.

Kind of funny...
The U.S. was formed by people who not so trusting of an overreaching government and now they have one.
