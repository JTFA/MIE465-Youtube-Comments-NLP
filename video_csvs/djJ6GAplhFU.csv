"From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!!!! Jokes aside, I agree with Hamil, the Luke portrayed in the movie is arrogant, cynical. He represents the Jedi's way in extreme, where the self righteousness of the Jedi has taken over them to act in any sensible manner. However, this can all be salvaged. By BRINGING IN THE LEGENDS IN PLAY and slightly tweaking them. After the fall of the empire and the rise of the new republic, Luke started his own Jedi order. Perhaps Han and Leia had three other children before Kylo Ren, perhaps Luke himself has a child, Ben Skywalker, who was killed by one the Solos, perhaps that's why Kylo ren was named Ben, after Ben skywalker as a kind of make up, and that's why Luke want to kill his nephew, because he is not the first Solo to fall in the Dark side.

"Good to see strong, smart WOMEN in powerful charge of lower males, and most lead roles finally filled by African American's instead of whites!

The corrected world is discarding them and their defective ways, and they can only cry-cry-cry! It is so funny to watch them humiliatingly reduced to their hateful sexist, and racist selves!

We are POWERFUL because we disrespectfully desecrate them and destroy everything they love and cherish... it is SOOOOO hilarious... LOL!!!

If you want INCLUSION and TOLERANCE, this is the movie for you! However, if you are the typical sexist racist, you are in for a very very very RUDE awakening!!

"Growing up with Star Wars.... I always imagined as MASTER JEDI Luke Skywalker being something like Obi Wan Kenobi only more masterful since he took on the entire EMPIRE and restored Faith in the Galaxy. I was wrong :) DISNEY showed me that LUKE SKYWALKER was nothing more than a depressed EMO Hermit on an Island living with Guilt and Regret. :) 

ALL that time I imagined MASTER LUKE, never did I imagine for him to become such a bitch... to make room for the less interesting young cast of characters who seem to have little to no backtory. REY is a Jedi? Her backstory is looking for scrap metal.... FINN atleast was a STORMTROOPER who escaped the First Order to join the Resistance and even considered sacrificing himself for the People to survive.... all while JEDI Rey was lifting rocks behind a cave.

DISNEY so smart :) make the female the Jedi because.... WHO CARES, she is female and we are progressive... but that BLACK GUY? He ain't no Jedi, he just does EVERYTHING A JEDI WOULD DO.... only he's not a Jedi, he's Black. REAL PROGRESSIVE DISNEY.... Real progressive.",0.862,211

If you are going to regress someone that much, we deserve to know why, how. All we got was a pathetic excuse to make Ben look more sympathetic.

Luke would never give up, he would never admit failure, he would right the wrongs, he would NEVER sneak up on someone while they were sleeping, and even think of killing them...Jedi don't do that ( ok, maybe Aniken - but he was Vader).  Milking scene was stupid, and must come from a public breast feeding advocate, or someone with mommy issues, or just a plain pervert.  We don't need these scenes, just like we don't need to see the characters taking a crap.  I almost fell asleep 3x, and they have Luke dying twice....just awful.

"I have heard this argument over and over. And it simply doesn't work. Because its not the same scenario. Luke on the death star was fighting for his life, adrenaline pumping through veins.

The child of his twin and best friend. 
Instead of perhaps calling for help. Reaching out to Yoda, Anakin, Leia, anyone. To try to help Ben first, not kill him.  If Luke had tried all the other options first, then maybe I could have believed it. As it stands, I don't.",0.2647,144

"Sun King l agree. Luke Skywalker is one of the greatest heroes in sci fi history-- not a coward. Luke would never have run away and hidden himself on an island while the galaxy was living with the consequences of the mistakes he made. He would have owned up to his mistakes and faced Ben man to man--not by using some force projection of himself. He also would have faced Han and Leia, owned up to what he had done and taken his share of the responsibility for what happened to Ben. Luke Skywalker went out like an old coward and that left a very bad taste in my mouth. TLJ was not a real Star Wars movie and the character Mark Hamill played was not Luke Skywalker.

"The core theme of the Last Jedi is about interaction between People of this fictional Galaxy and the Force that binds it. The characters in the story, including Luke provide insights into the many ways that it can affect People and the Societies that they are part of. even split second reaction to events have consequences good and bad, the presence of the Force gives greater power to those that wield, and with power comes consequences good and bad.  It's only be fully embracing and respecting the   Force can one reach balance and ultimately enlightenment.   This is very much our worlds' eastern philosophy that inspired it, look to Buddhism and other eastern religions and philosophy and you'll see all the parallels with the Force.

My reading of Rian's choices for Luke's story line was about dealing with consequences of his and Ben's power, he saw Ben's darker side and future and made a split second mistake on how to deal with it, and caused the very thing he was fearful of.  This was history repeating itself - harking back to prequels,  endless cycle of good and bad that can come from inappropriately wielding the great power of the Force.   Luke took himself out of the fray to break the cycle and even broke his connection to the Force.  

Shutting off from the Society and breaking your connection to what binds the world around didn't provide any resolution for Luke.   It was only with Yoda's intervention was Luke able to properly let go of his mistakes and reconnect with the  Force and accept it fully, it's consequences and his role in it, and once he did this he could rejoin the fray.  He finished at peace with his place in the Star Wars Galaxy, he reach enlightenment and finally transcend physical form to become at one with the cosmic Force.  Luke did not die, he just left his physical form behind just like the Jedi masters (Yoda, Obi-wan, Qui-gon) before him that reach enlightenment.

In eastern philosophy reaching enlightenment is the ultimate goal of any follower, it's an a ultimate step in ones journey, it's not a sad event of death and a step of passing onto something greater.  We say this joyful step in the Last Jedi, Luke achieved the greatest thing a Jedi can do in their journey.  One should rejoice that he achieved this.  And like Yoda and Obi-wan his story is not over.

One can disagree with the character ark that Rian put Luke through to reach enlightenment, Luke loosing Hope is the opposite what he originally was - he was the ""New Hope"", it is however understandable is you relate to Luke at a human level, rather the what he has been built up in fandom as a infallible Legend.  If one accepts Luke is not a super hero but a real person that it becomes understandable.  The story arc for Luke isn't about inflating Luke's legend and fan serving, it was about Luke's role in a wider Galaxy with wider forces at play, Luke is just a cog in this cosmic Force clock that keeps on ticking.  

At it very heat the Last Jedi is all about the Force, Ray and Kylo are the embodiment of Jing and Yang, they are now on their turbulent journey.  Luke's journey was as a fallen hero, lots his own path and finally found his ""place in all this"" and returned to his path to enlightenment, when he did he transcended to a higher plane of existence.",0.8528,641
