If he didn't miss it he probably would of gotten there to early and took Diggs down. Which would be pass interference. Since the game can't end with a penalty and the vikings would be in fleid goal range and they would most likely have gotten the fleid goal and win the game.

"It was already dark outside and I was driving down a long stretch of road on my way to pick up my girlfriend. Along the way she was texting me the score and how much time was left in the game.  She texted... ( 21 - 20 Saints )  Then... ( 23 - 21 Vikings 1:29 )  So I figured the Saints had 1:29 to try and get in field goal range. I didn't think they would as the Vikings have a good defense this year.  Then, 12 minutes later she texted me... ( 24 - 23 Saints )  I became really sad. I came to a stop sign with no one around and just put my head down. I then preceded to the house she was at, thinking about how good the vikings had done all year, and how it was all over in their first playoff game.  I sadly sat there in the car in front of the house waiting for her to come out.  Then, ding ding, another text.   I figured she was gonna tell me she would be right out, but the text read ( Woo hoo we won ) I looked up to the star filled sky, and quietly whispered, ""Thank you Jesus.""",0.9063,231
