That's a big assumption.

"1.The sad fact actually is that U.S. ""culture"" and ""heroism"" is based on superheros. 
2.Another sad fact is that you measure ""equality""(a bizare goal by itself) by representation in movies. 
3.You measure ""privilege"" by sex, race, skin color, physical condition even, instead by wealth and class. 
4.You worship Black Sub-Saharan culture and conservation of ethnic identities(supposedly), allegedly opposing  White (neo)colonialism, while not applying the same standards towards native Europeans and the colonization and cultural-economic exploitation of native European lands by the USA and non-European colonization of contemporary Europe(read ""migrations"", ""settlement"" etc.)
5.You humiliate Black countries by promoting a ridiculous fiction movie(which might be good, but that's irrelevant to the reason of the promotion), and actually remain ignorant about Sub-Saharan actual history. 
6.""The West"" thus ceases to be ""biologically racist""(""White"" supremacist), but retains it's ignorant way of thinking in regards to notions cultural superiority, and thus assumes it's values are universal values, therefore we no longer have murders of millions based solely on their ethnic background, but on the premise that their society is ""undemocratic"", that they ""violate human rights"",  that they are ""dictatorial"" etc. And often the victims of the same Western (neo)colonialism are the same as before, just under another, slightly different pretext.
7.The fact that ""White"" countries self-destroyed their own native populations(example: London is now majority non-native) does not make these countries any better(as explained above, the exploatatory nature of these societies didn't change), on the contrary, it makes contemporary West even more repulsive and dangerous, for if they did this to their own people, if they exterminate themselves, than why wouldn't they do the same to the populations of other countries and continents.
8.Movies such as this do not help the Black populations either. They equate them with the ""Black supremacist"" movements, which are spin-offs of Nordic or White supremacist movements of early XX century Europe, which reached parody proportions in contemporary ""alt-right"" idiotic movements.",-0.9705,416

For the people saying “why can’t you identify with super heroes that aren’t black? Why does race matter so much? Isn’t it more about the character itself than the race of the character?” And while I agree that it shouldn’t matter the race of the character it’s very clear that the race of characters does matter in Hollywood since most characters in all media tend to be white. The fact that black people aren’t presented as the hero very often isn’t something that doesn’t matter because it’s black people specifically who tend to rarely get lead roles in film. If we were already having equal representation of different races in media it would be different because then the race of someone truly doesn’t matter. While I and many other people like to imagine a colour blind society where this stuff doesn’t matter we have to be real and be honest and say while we may think race doesn’t matter it is a factor in a lot of things on how you are treated in society and while most white people arent racist the fact that there is a social imbalance based on skin colour when trying to get jobs or to have media representation or the type of education you get just shows that the ideal may be a colour blind society but we need to get black people on an equal playing field first along with all the other races before we can pretend like race doesn’t affect how people are treated in society because it statistically does,0.9571,293

I find a lot of these Film Studios and the biggest of Corporations such as Google who take such extensive measures in terms of diversity to actually be the racist ones. For example you will always see diversity in movies such as a white woman dating a black man but you will never see a white man dating a black woman and the psychology behind it is so absurd the amount of thought they put into it. So in essence of white man is to domineering so he should not be dating a black woman in the movie but a white woman is seen as a social underclass compared to white men so she can date a black man who is also a minority or considered under class for so many years. You can see here that the amount of thought they put into these relationships and actors shows their other insanity of trying to be racially sensitive whilst being the most racially charged.,-0.8798,168

"To me it seems that people of colour are not seen that often in comic media as heroes because most comic writers/artists are white, making it easier for them to put themselves into  the role of a white hero character. It's just harder to write a story about culture you've never been a deep part of.",0.8658,61
"To the people saying it's just a comic book/movie...You don't seem to understand that there can be messages that people receive subconsciously as they read or watch these movies. If a child is only shown white super heroes over and over again and is later told to think of a superhero, there's probably a good chance the kid will think of the hero as white and only white. While Black Panther was planned as part of the MCU, the effort shown in the movie tells me they wanted it to be culturally significant too. They could have easily been lazy with this movie by completely stereotyping Africa as movies often do. They also gave the villain a good deal of complexity and even avoided using the title of man ape for a character due to negative connotations associated with it. You can definitely enjoy this movie for what it is but don't use that to dismiss the implications.",0.8047,170

"Why cant we just enjoy movies without debating about race and politics along the way?
In Black Panter, most people are black because it is set in Africa and movies about medieval Europe for instance shouldn't have black actors in them (at least not portraying european ethnicities) if they want to create an accurate depiction of their setting. End of debate.
Concerning the movie market, it works like every other market. There is supply and demand for certain products (in this case movies starring actors of different colours) and supply and demand automatically move towards a point where they are the same. More actors of colour playing major roles in blockbuster movies has nothing to do with fighting racism and being brave and such. Its just the market reacting to changes in demand.

"You didn't explain why any of this matters though. Minorities are typically in a lower socio-economic bracket so its harder for them to break into higher paying or more skilled jobs, just like any poor person. I personally don't care about whitewashing and I imagine that as more people of color rise to a higher social status we will see more people of color in those jobs, and that is great but I don't understand why we need to lampoon directors for casting white actors. There are simply more white actors, or at least more famous ones, and we shouldn't expect Hollywood to go against their financial and marketing decisions just so they can intentionally search for a black actor that can play a role that an already famous white actor is qualified for.",0.4586,142
