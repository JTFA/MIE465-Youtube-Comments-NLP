Absolutely love the McMaster Carr imports,0.6697,6
Amazing. Just saw this on reddit and have subbed. It's great work.,0.836,15
"Another way you could resize those holes is using the press pull command on the inside cylinders.

Great video, always love seeing your name in my sub box.",0.8519,31
Beautiful work. Love the whole design.,0.8442,8
Cool project. Wouldn't it have made sense to use a much larger percentage infill though? Stress on the brackets is relatively high.,-0.128,25
Could your explain the difference in the import options? ie. 3D step.......and others?,0.0,18

Don't apologize: you did design.  Excellent presentation too!,0.5713,11
Ecellent work!  Why not post/upload your brackets to thingiverse.com?,0.0,13

Great tip! ðŸ˜Š,0.6588,4
Great video!  I'm gonna make a desk too,0.6588,9
Great video. Just the right level of detail. Easy to follow.,0.7906,14
Hello!  I love your videos ðŸ˜Š,0.6696,7
"Hey dude, can you share your slicer settings for that printer?!",0.3595,14
"Hi Vlad, that's an excellent practical use for 3DP. You know I love the way you present your videos.
I would have added triangular braces to the back and sides to reduce the wobble, although printing the brackets for those might be a bit of a challenge. But then, thats why we do what we do eh.
Keep up the great work.",0.9231,70
"How many outer shells, top, and bottom layers did you use?",0.2023,14
"I just found your channel via hackaday article. Great job, you have a new subscriber. It's nice to see variety of presenters in the 3D community. Can I recommend using a router to finish the edges.",0.8555,41
"I keep forgetting how powerful having the McMaster-Carr catalog at your fingertips can be!  Counter sinking your screw holes just enough to accommodate the washers and screw heads would be another good tweak to your part.  Thanks, as always, for your awesome vids!",0.9097,48
I love this feature.  It really comes in handy.  Even if to test out the part before buying the real one.,0.6369,24
I think he means if you're allowed to print your own from the catalogue?,0.0,15
I think there is diminishing returns after a certain level of infill.  I'm not sure what that number is but I believe it's well below 100%.  The highest I've ever infilled is 40%.,0.4346,38
I was surprised you didn't print at 100% infill.,0.2263,11
I went with three top and bottom layers and two shells.,0.2023,12
I've been using the default cr-10 profile with Simplify 3D for my prints but I may do a video with more details on the settings.,0.0,28
If I imported a simple washer from Mcmaster -Carr are you able to change the thickness dimension?,0.0,19
If it clears the Wandel test i'll be impressed.,0.5267,10
Iâ€™m just starting to learn CAD in Fusion - loved your tip with the McMaster flange part!,0.636,20
Love it,0.6369,2
"Nice and simple... very cool. 20% seemed a little sparse for a structural part, but obviously it's good enough if it is still standing.",0.7612,29
Nice practical printing! I love it! I used a lot of printing for a coffee table I finished last.,0.8217,22
Nice project :),0.7003,3

"Really great idea, man! Those fittings can be so expensive.",0.6893,13
Solid tip on using that catalogue! That's a good reason to give Fusion 360 a shot.,0.5848,18
Subbed too :),0.4588,3
Thank you Kelsi.,0.3612,4
Thank you very much for the video. I learned something new.,0.3612,13
Thanks Adam,0.4404,2
"Thanks AurorA,  I love coming up with practical uses and enjoy making the videos.",0.8834,16
Thanks Bruno.,0.4404,3
Thanks Cat.  I appreciate the nice comment.  Fusion 360 is a great modeling software.  You'll enjoy working with it.,0.9403,23
Thanks JAYTEE.,0.4404,3
"Thanks MBS.  I hadn't even realized that hackaday published this yet.  Just read the article.  Those guys do a great job with their writing.  Yes, this could definitely use a router to the edges and some sanding and staining.  I'm waiting for the weather to get warmer so I can take it outside and do some finishing work.",0.9274,65
Thanks Mick and thanks for posting.,0.7003,7
"Thanks Ogg.  Yes, good point on the press pull option.",0.8176,13
Thanks Paul.  I love making them!,0.8122,8
Thanks Spike.  I think you are right.  Some triangle braces would greatly improve the stability.  It's definitely doable.  I may have to consider making some as it is currently a bit wobbly.,0.8313,37
Thanks for the tip.  I have yet to give annealing a try.,0.4404,14
Thanks!,0.4926,2
"Thanks, glad you found helpful.",0.8271,7
Thanks.,0.4404,2
"That fillet on the flange is going to give you a lot less strength than you assume it will, given the load it's bearing.  It will give you approximately zero added strength.  Those flanges will all shatter if someone even thinks about leaning into the short side of the table.  If you print with 100% infill then carefully anneal the plastic once it's printed then it'll be a heck of a lot stronger.  It won't be a fast or cheap print, though.  That's a great use for a 3D printer, by the way.  Things like that are perfect for 3D printing, provided they're designed well and used carefully.",0.9675,120
They are different file types  and you would chose the best option for you depending on the CAD software you're using.  3D step seems to work best with Fusion 360 and it's really the only one I've used.,0.8555,40

"This is great, well done. I just posted this video on ""The Perfect WorkShop"" https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfectworkshop/",0.872,19
This is super helpful and informative! Thanks for sharing :),0.9402,11
Very cool project for a functional print!,0.4376,8
Very informative.. Thanks,0.4902,4
"WOW very good prints.
What is the PLA used? << the link is sending me to the CR10 printer.

Thanks",0.8916,24

What does the Fusion 360 license have anything to do with him 3D printing objects? If you have a Maker License you have to make more than 100k a year using it before they make you purchase a the full version.,0.0,43
What is the name/model of the 3d printer you used?,0.0,13
Would be interested if this way of usage is covered by the license if the service you are using.,0.4019,20
"Yes, I saw there was a little wobble. Perhaps a follow up video? Although I'm betting you already thought of that :-)",0.6124,25
"Yes, but not sure how much stronger it would have been.  There are other design choices I could make that would make this much stronger.",0.7357,28
"Yes, using the same approach on the video.",0.4019,10
You have an excellent way of teaching! Very nice project. I will take a look at your other videos. I want to learn how to work with Fusion 360Â°,0.8118,33
another great video,0.6249,3
could you share the file for the parts its cool love to print them out also,0.8271,16
"love your video man keep it up, thanks for showing us the usefulness of Fusion 360 and 3d printer",0.8519,20
"northshorepx that's what I meant. Does the license a) cover to manufacture / 3d print one or more parts and b) making money with it like here (even if the earnings are for the tutorial and not the part). My understanding is, that those files are for assemblies in F360 and part lists.",0.3612,61
super practical solution! Love your inventions!,0.8997,8
