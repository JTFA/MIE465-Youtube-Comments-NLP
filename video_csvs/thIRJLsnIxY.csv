"@integrity matters
Personally I have experienced both sides of the Atlantic with a mother who is Western European and a father who is an American citizen.
On a superficial materialist level the U.S. is an impressive country that consumes a ten fold of the resources that the rest of the world uses and creates more pollution than many other countries combined while instigating regime changes and wars for control over fossil fuel resources in the Middle East.

Western Europe has a limited land mass compared to the U.S. but we did not annihilate an indigenous population just so we can have a sprawling suburban villa with a swimming pool in our backyard.
What we do have in Western Europe is moral values and cultural significance that have developed over many centuries which has benefited its citizens in a more egalitarian manner while flourishing economically. 

While it could be amusing to some hearing your 'Murica' bravado with its underlining naivety, to me it is clearly a symptom of the dysfunctional educational system that has become inherent to American society.
Nevertheless, bless you and bless America.
May its citizens find liberation from the stranglehold that the American plutocrats, the military industrial complex, the Wall Street bankers, the corrupt political class and the fossil fuel industrialists hold on the American population!",0.9676,238

"Although we agree on a multitude of issues we could not differ more on what caused them and how they can be solved.
It saddens me to see so many Americans have bought into the hope that Trump would bring change, just like many were deceived by Obama's promises of hope and change.

Trump ran his campaign on a platform of quasi non interventionism and platitudes about 'jobs' to appeal to the working class of America which was a populist strategy that worked because so many Americans are hurting financially.
However when he came into office he installed multiple Goldmann Sachs bankers in his cabinet, ramped up the drone warfare program, bombed Syria and Afghanistan, installed a tax program to benefit the wealthiest 1%, expanded the surveillance state, shipped a multi billion weapons shipment to the lslamic fascists of Saudi Arabia, heightened tensions in the Middle East by moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem etcetera etcetera.

Trump has basically revealed himself to be a showman who will say anything to please his voter base but makes his presidential decisions purely based on what is favourable for the plutocratic elites as a generic establishment politician.
The corruption in Washington is endemic to the system and will not be changed by a Trump presidency, actually it seems to be thriving rather well now.

You will probably disagree with me but perhaps in years to come you will see how middle class and working class Americans have been hoodwinked by Trump just as they were with the previous presidents.",0.0258,277

"Voice of Europe: Mohammed Most Popular Name For Newborn Boys In The Netherlands For Second Year In A Row…

Celebrate diversity!

Via Voice of Europe:

    Dutch mainstream media reported that Noah was the most popular baby name for boys in the Netherlands, but a little digging turned out a different finding.

    The name Noah was putatively considered the most popular boy’s name for 2017, having been given to 635 new-born boys in the Netherlands. A journalist from broadcaster Powned did some research into the database, however, and noticed that another name, a non-traditional Dutch name, was slightly more prevalent.

    This journalist checked for Mohammed and its alternative spellings. He thus counted:

    Mohammed 221, Mohamed 211, Muhammed 110, Mohammad 51, Muhammad 43 and reached a total of 636. Other forms like Mohamad, Muhamed, Muhammet, Mouhamed, Muhamad and Mahamuud could not be checked for “privacy reasons”.

    Of course, other forms of Noah like Noa and Noach should be checked as well for the sake of fairness: both, however, were not listed according to the Dutch journalist.

    The author says, it is the second year in a row that Mohammed is the most popular name for baby boys: In 2016 there were 724 baby’s named Mohammed (or one of it’s Arabic alternatives) in the Netherlands.

    He also mentions that the same tendency was seen in England in 2016: It is not Oliver, but Mohammed (with all its permutations), that is the most popular name for baby boy",0.9816,292

To accept any kind of government assistance or charity in america - used to be very shameful.  We need to get back to the independence and innovation engine that makes america unique.

Why do you think this is about poitical (in)correctness? Hoekstra clearly made some false statements (some would call them lies). Free press of The Netherlands held him accountable for these false statements. That's how free press works. If you're old enough, you might remember this from the pre-Trump era.

""socialist use magical thinking""
What does socialisn have to do with a lying US representative? Do you even understand the meaning(s) of socialism? Do you think The Netherlands is a socialist country in the way you have parroted its meaning (without understanding it)?
