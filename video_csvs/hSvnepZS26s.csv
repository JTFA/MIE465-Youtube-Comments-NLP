"*Calling it right now: Kilgrave is back.*

Think about it. They said they brought her back to life. Well, guess who is dead and can be brought back, himself? Kilgrave.

Who loves the color purple and who would Jessica be terrified and shocked to see clapping their hands in such a way? Kilgrave.

He'll either be a side villain or a temporary ally, is what I imagine.

Season 1 had multiple good things (i.e. acting, storywriting, scenery, camera angles, directing and episode layout) that made the overall show great.  I would like to see JJ Season 2 highlight of more her abilities (not too heavy on the CGI...save that for the MCU movies) and be involved romantically with another guy... with her banging him so hard she hurts him...LOL",0.9767,129
