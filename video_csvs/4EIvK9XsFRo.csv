"*I literally just posted this on Facebook earlier today! This is how I practiced optimism!* 

Why today is a bad day:
1) I couldn‚Äôt bring any coffee with me to work this morning, because our coffee maker is broken!
2) I forgot to bring my lunch to work that I had spent the time to pack this morning.
3) I had to drive 30 minutes to an appointment during my break to get a new dependent ID and their system was down so I wasted 40 minutes in a waiting room for nothing and had to drive the 30 minutes back to work.
4) I unexpectedly started my period today without having brought my diva cup with me!

Why today is a GREAT day:
1) I nanny for a very generous family who shared their coffee with me this morning.
2) They also allow me to eat their food if I‚Äôm hungry. So I got to have goldfish crackers and a quesadilla for lunch today instead of whatever boring food I packed.
3) I got to drive 30 minutes through the beautiful city of San Diego and across the Coronado bridge with a stunning view of the ocean to spend 40 minutes laughing with my husband during my break.
4) I had the forethought to always have tampons in my purse just in case my period comes unexpectedly. Thank you, past Heather! Also, yay for no babies!
BONUS: I woke up in our new house this morning and only had to drive 15 minutes to work instead of my old 40 minute annoying commute.
BONUS: I have the evening off of rehearsal to spend with my wonderful husband before he leaves for training.
BONUS: I have an awesome rewarding job that challenges and delights me.
BONUS: I am healthy and fit and (let‚Äôs face it) gorgeous and funny and just generally an awesome human to be around.
BONUS: Harley üê∂ (need I say more?)

I just wanted to share this for anyone else who is having a ‚Äúbad‚Äù day. With a change in perspective, those minor annoyances can be seen as beautiful blessings. Just keep swimming, everybody!",0.9972,412

"AHHAHHHHHH poverty? health and women issues is sort of going out of your way to avoid the facts that it is all about pollution and overpopulation and the human footprint on the planet via the techno sphere.... sort of going far away from the reality of the planet to speak fo third level subject and ignored the 1st and 2nd level ones 100%.... is this how you bullshit millions on end to not see the real problems?
c) almost halved BUT many times more pollution and harm to land and water as well as Air and the natural function of the planet. Sp less poor = more pollution and more babies to do more pollution and so not going forwards at all. MOVING PEOPLE UP has only = more much more pollution and far more harm to nature and GROWING numbers... destroying the planet with a smile Mr Gates! Avoiding population reduction as ONLY solution.

c) fallen by half causing bith rates to go up and more people use up resources strip the lands and unbalance nature as they go. Cut in 1/2 equals millions of extra born people that should not of existed in the 1st place with birth balanced villages and cities that just do not make babies and permit population balance... this is stupid doom without logic of simple changing 1 problem into another and not solve it... shame Mr gates proud of doing the wrong thing in the wrong way and still wind up with same problem in future. population care = balance and health not more births! women contraception = vast pollution!
Reducing population growth does not stop or balance it... it continues doom!

used to be 6 is now 9 and so horrible levels of education world wide... basically keeping humans as slaves.
Soon web will be world wide... then maybe education would work.. but the web is corrupt and so victims are about to be made. To pay on the PLANET for education = crime! EDUCATION is simple copied best teachers of the planet..

most women hold most of the money of the planet due to inheritance passed down. Women almost always wound up with the money by outliving husbands as women do live longer and have less reasons to spend it... so answer never changes in history... women always had the majority of the money. The reality is that the majority of the planet has no bank account and they are playing games with your mind here.
4 to 5 BILLION do not even have a toilet.

what we see is the works done are based on teh very flaws that create them and so is not a solution just another path to doom just different fails.

Intentions will NOT save the future! Building villages and cities correctly and not loser tower and grids that promote fail by just existing and people too blind naive to understand 1 template works for planet and world and space... what gates offers now is what we see as PATCHWORK for a problem he dares ignore deliberate of overpopulation that once stopped ends capitalism forever.... so he is protecting capitalism against the true solutions that work.

If Gates wanted to save the future in compassion he would simply build my villages and save 1 village at a time all over the planet as examples to all others of what works 1 million years over what man has built that will not last long at all and is all wrong.

play all you want... in the end overpopulation destroys the planet via pollution and wars over resources of plain insanity like Trump wanting to do the wrong thing all the time due to mental problems with dementia no one is taking seriously.

your world is doomed like it or not! Capitalism is just another form of slavery and NEEDS new victims or dies. No new pavement, building,. schools and all the crap not needed that you build now or you not build it from lack of need... so you repair and upgrade and look to the stars... because you are not wasting time on babies that never should of been born to be slaved via credit to feed a monster that never shuts up from screaming MORE MORE MORE! till all are dead.
Balanced population on the planet = capitalism dies.... do you think them monsters want to die? so please... face reality! no babies no capitalism or a future timeline.... choose!
if you choose capitalism know you are slaved to slave others and waste time making babies to slave others and never ever will they teach you the truth about the wqords FREEDOM and LIBERTY they tried to remove liberty and lie up freedom to be reverse of what it means just to prevent YOU from thinking FREEDOM FROM and LIBERTY TO... because it implies a cure exist and is possible to build and maintain to save village after villages... and it was given as a cure far in the past history of humans by wisdom that is lacking today to simply grasp equality.

so Gates... with the money you have you could save the world and no one could stop you... but you chose to play and pollute and harm the world more thinking 1/2 ass ways will work 100%
Prove me wrong.... or build what i say! even in models my villages beat all others on the planet and not one will beat mine ever in hostory to come... just saying... WHAT you been thinking all your lives????
How not to solve the problems and just play with the tips of the problem will solve the whole logic????
I knew in 1966 it was MY WAY or the future of this planet is doomed to be just a library left behind on a dead planet caused by humans too stupid to see a future past wars and playing MONOPOLY with reality when the dam game never ever had a winner! ALL LOSE in monopoly... no one left to rent you die alone and the whole game does not work without other players ALIVE...teaching your kids to destroy others via greed and vanity till doom...great!
try logic wisdom and correct form and functions to make every one of my village beyond all you have for the next million years here off world or any other world... it is my way or fail.",-0.9985,1148

However, the gap still remains horribly big between realities. Just like Bill said, extreme poverty in sub-saharan Africa has not gone down at the same rate as other regions such as India. In this sense, it is good to have a notion of the progress that has been done but still know that we must understand these issues on a more regional level, to get a more accurate picture of where we stand. These numbers show that it is possible to do much more than we believed, but they must not make us too optimistic. Worldwide positive numbers mean nothing to someone who has just lost their child to hunger. A sense of how much there is still to be done and alertness of the urgency of these issues for individual lives moves a lot more mountains.",0.9451,181

"I really liked this video, because our society and media likes to always concentrate on the bad thinks that ae happening, which are happening (like the new numbers about children affected by war), but not everything is getting worse.

A very personal story about optimism just happened very recently: 
three weeks ago, my mother called and told me, that my Dad, who is the most selfless and strongest person I know, is in the hospital for tests, because his doctos thaught he found a tumor. 
I was completely shocked, but the news got worse everyday in the following ten day: they saw something in his pancreas, in addiotion to three tumors in other places in his body, they were convinced he was suffering from pancreatic cancer and only had about two month left to live. 

My whole family was crushed, but after a few days of crying I stopped accepting this new truth, I didn't believe it and some things just didn't add up in my mind. 
My Dad already started planning things for his death, because he didn't want my Mom to have to deal with certan things, my sister planned to move her wedding date up a few month and all this stuff. Finally my parents had an appointment with the doctor for the final diagnosis, that everybody, including numerous doctors, already thought, that they knew. But guess what, they didn't!
My Dad still has cancer, but he is going to live! It still sucks and Chemo is a bitch, but he is going to live! All this time, I felt like I needed to stop avoiding reality, but in the end I was right and my optimism wasn't avoining reality but not thinking the worst unless all facts line up!

I wish you all a wonderful day, week, life, because I am in hugging-mode at the moment! ;)",-0.9752,353

To shut your mind off to the existence of and ignore at least half of all info is closed minded ignorance.

OMG INGRIIIIID! you're so amazing and such an inspiration <3,0.9092,11
"Oh dear!!! My first biography I ever read was Bill Gates, I remember asking my Dad what was is it that Bill did for a living and he said ‚Äúwell he kinda created computers; he is an engineer‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt end up on tech world, but I remember being sooo excited to be as my Dad and Bill Gates",0.7294,70
"Okay, I really don‚Äôt care about this girl or her channel. But this video should have WAY more views, Bill Gates is in it for Pete‚Äôs sake!!",0.7151,36
"Omg I interviewed Bill Gates!! In the comments below, I'd love it if you would share a moment in your life when you‚Äôve practiced optimism. If you‚Äôre having remembering a moment, try and draw from the experiences of others and harness that energy, because we‚Äôve all practiced optimism in some way. Thank you so much for watching!",0.9576,71

Point of the video: the details don‚Äôt matter as long as the big picture is beautiful. The world will always advance. Humanity will always be progressive.,0.6124,32
Seeing you here now after years of watching you through my adolescence is beyond inspiring. You're one of my heros.,0.6249,22
Short answer:  yes,0.4019,4
"So basically what we‚Äôve learned from this is:
Although our quality of life has improved, our attitudes have gotten worse. 

That makes way more sense, honestly ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0.507,42

THIS WAS PHENOMENAL,0.0,3
Thank you so much for this video Ingrid! I have been having a tough few weeks but watching this made me smile :) You gave me lots of reasons to remain positive,0.9318,33
Thank you to both you and Bill Gates for making this video. I'm generally an optimist but surrounded by pessimists (aka people who watch Fox News) and sometimes fall into that trap in thinking that the world is going to hell in a handbasket. When it comes down to it: fear sells. Pessimism sells.,-0.9549,61
That is why Bill is so rich! He always think so positive and great realization and action!,0.9449,19
That was so interesting thank you for that! It‚Äôs so fascinating seeing such powerful (money wise) people being so humble and overall so nice and wise spoken!,0.9687,33
That's great Ingrid very informative..keep it up we need more Things not just beauty ...it's sad that africa is so rich in resources but poor ...and yet people come from other places just to give u what u thought it's your right..this is not helpful in a long term ..,-0.7074,56

The world does not suck.  Humanity does.,0.3412,9
"The world lived for centuries oppressing certain groups and populations for making the rich richer. Only in recent years have we noticed our deep mistakes and have began to realise that only working together can we really move forward. With the rise of the civil rights movements, welfare, fundamental human rights, advances in medicine, and all over compassion is that we began to fight against all of the hate and hurt in which we lived before. I work in conversation and development and even if I fall into pessimism, I have to remain optimist everyday to be able to imagine and pursue a better, fairer, more just world for everyone.",0.5719,121
The world sucks a lot.  There's probably someone being flayed alive right now.,0.0258,15
"This guy has explicitly admitted to using vaccines as a means of population reduction! It's absurd to think that his real objective  includes helping people live longer when he's obsessed with population control! As if he developed misquitos that administer vaccines to unwilling people with the intent of making them live longer and be healthy enough to reproduce when his main concern is population reduction!! He says African children live longer on avg now as a result of ""women's healthcare"" ie lots of abortions for the destitute, they live longer on avg because more aren't being born! He brings up population reduction right after mentioning poverty reduction, implying that there are less poor becaue they died out and that's good! Be positive all you want, what it really comes down to glorifying the illimination of certain sections of the human race and eugenics and this faggy loser would have only 1 billion people on earth, tops if he could complete his plan!!",0.8053,176
This guy is a chump like the rest of these rich fucks. Literally don't do a God damb thing for others unless it benefits them selves. Think about it. The only thing rich people do is. (Let's create a foundation in our names) to show we do good thing's and that's it. Selfish self centered fucks.,0.734,64

This was SUUUUPER interesting!,0.4574,5
"This was a great interview. Bill tends to only get asked ""how do I make as much money as you?"" when he is being interviewed -- and you can tell making a ton of money was never his goal. He's ultra intelligent and passionate and has so much more to share than dolt interviewers give him the opportunity to. Thank you so much for this, Ingrid.",0.9537,75

Your question about girls access to secondary ed reminded me that every year they raise money to give a scholarship to an at-risk girl in rural Thailand that pays for her incidental expenses so she can continue her education. I believe they still do this every year. They are an example of a little known organization that strives to help in their corner of the world.

your dad was confused. the engineer was at Apple. his name is wozniak. Gates got lucky. he bought someone's product and sold it to IBM. Gate's product was inferior but cheaper. IBM put the product in every desk top computer. Gates then bought windows from Apple. Apple had a really stupid CEO then name scully. Gates then copied Apple's video code without permission.  Gates had to pay millions of dollars to Apple. Microsoft office is a copy of products made by many companies. VisiCalc etc,-0.7218,97
