"(Jesus was not a created being, as the Mormons believe, or the Muslims that are saying he is only a prophet. He is the ONE and ONLY, TRUE SON OF GOD!!!):

(Jesus):

I have glorified thee 
on the earth:

I have finished the work 
which thou gavest me to do.

And now, 
O Father,
glorify thou me 

with thine own self
with the glory 

which I had with thee
before
the world was.

(John 17:4-5).

***(I have glorified you): Jesus made known the Father by completing the work God gave Him to do.

***(Glorify Me): Jesus looked to the Father to restore Him to the glory He had in heaven before he left.

***(Philippians 2:6)<---Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.

***This is another indication of Christ's preexistence and deity. (John 1:1-14).

***Jesus was praying to enter into that pristine state of coequal glory with the Father, a position he possessed from eternity as God's only Son.

***He would enter into that glory in a new way---as the God-man, the crucified and risen Lord Jesus Christ!

***(John 8:24)<---(Jesus)<---I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 (The Holy Spirit explained in the book of John):

***The Holy spirit is the third person of the Trinity who exercise the power of the Father and the Son in creation and redemption. Because the Holy Spirit is the power by which believers come to Christ and see with new eyes of faith, He is closer to us than we are to ourselves. Like the eyes of the body through which we see physical things, He is seldom in focus to be seen directly because He is the one through whom all else is seen in a new light. This explains why the relationship of the Father and the Son is more prominent in the Gospels, because it is through the eyes of the Holy Spirit that the Father-Son relationship is viewed.

***The Holy Spirit appears in the Gospel of John as the power by which Christians are brought to faith and helped to understand their walk with God: He brings a person to new birth: ""That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"" (John 3:6); ""It is the Spirit who gives life"" (John 6:63); The Holy Spirit is the Paraclete, or Helper, whom Jesus promised to the disciples after His ascension. The Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are unified in ministering to believers (John 14:16)<---And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. (John 14:26)<---But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you). It is through the Helper that Father and Son abide with the disciples (John 15:26)<---But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.

***This unified ministry of the Trinity is also seen as the Spirit brings the world under conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment. He guides believers in to all truth with what he hears from the Father and the Son. (John 15:26). It is a remarkable fact that each person of the Trinity serves the others as all defer to one another. The Son says what he hears from the Father (John 12:49-50). The Father witnesses to and glorifies the Son (John 8:16-18 & 50, 54); The Father and Son honor the Holy Spirit by commissioning him to speak in their name. The Holy Spirit honors the Father and Son by helping the community of believers.

***Like Father and Son, the Holy Spirit is at the disposal of the other persons of the Trinity, and all three are one in graciously being at the disposal of the redeemed family of believers. The Holy Spirit's attitude and ministry are marked by generosity; His chief function is to illumine Jesus teaching, to glorify his person, and to work in the life of the individual believer and the church.

***(Romans 8:9)<---But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man (have not) (the Spirit of Christ), he is (none of his).

***(Acts 5:32)<---And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that (obey him).

***(Hebrews 1:9)<---Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the (oil) of (gladness) above thy fellows.

***(Are you a WISE or FOOLISH VIRGIN???):

***(Matthew 25:3-4)<---They that were (foolish) took their lamps, and took (no oil) with them: But the (wise) took (oil in their vessels) with their lamps.

***(Ephesians 4:30)<---And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, 
whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

***(The Holy Spirit of God): Should never be pushed away, ignored, or rejected, If we would remember that the one who lives in us is God's own spirit, we would be much more selective about what we think, read, watch, say, and do. Note that Paul acknowledges that (evil thoughts) and (actions) are (temptations) even for those who are (sealed) by the (Holy Spirit).",0.9954,1202

So it's socially acceptable for women to degrade men by using them as a horse. If they were reversed women would be freaking out.  This is the behavior that makes men not want to become involved with women. Most of you have no respect for men.  Men are not horses and should not be treated like shit. If you expect equal treatment then you better start giving it.,-0.4345,74
