@GreatScott!! You just need to add two washers between ball bearings and plastic box - see the screenshot https://bdfss.blob.core.windows.net/shots/2018-02-21_00-11-54-857ee95e-7a67-4706-86a1-fa0cb568d267.png it's related to this timecode - https://youtu.be/AMiXme4bMUk?t=402,0.0,28
@greatscott ive been watching you for long time i wonder if you can make an arduino video of two servos that start after the other stops its rotation,-0.1531,28

A small cutout where the outer edge of the bearings contact the place would let you lock it down a little tighter while keeping the bearings free-spinning.,0.0,28
"Adding some thin washers in between the bearings and the rotor shaft would help, but having the tube better contained on the outer circumference wall will increase its life span.  I think it flops too much inside compared to the professional unit.",0.6757,45
"Although I understand that using readily avalable CAD material would save a lot of time, I wonder why did'nt you manage to recreate one by yourself, trying to reverse engineer the provided model, as you are showing the needed basic skills in Fusion 360 to do so. It would be cleaner and you can add all features you want. (If you are interested, I can do it and attach the ipt file right here).

BTW,  depending on your stepper motor inductance per phase, you could achieve greater RPMs and torque by using higher voltage with proper current limit (<= motor rating) and thus, higher flow rate for the pump. The driver datasheet says it could use up to 48v and by my experience, Nema 19 motors of the size shown usually can handle 24  v with no issue, even 36v with proper heasinking.

Great video! Well explained and good to see the DIY won!
Quick question, based on calculation, what would the flow rate be? Can you also tell us what the frequency of the stepper motor is?
Last question, why did you select the 16 steps per rotation option. Wouldn't less give a higher rpm, don't know what the torque should be for driving, but I bet it should handle it well.
Gives a higher flow rate.
