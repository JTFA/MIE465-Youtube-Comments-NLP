"Oh that we could fake suicides via auto-erotic asphyxiation whilst wearing boots shaped like giant tulips with orange and yellow spiraled stripes and the rest of our bodies wrapped with saran wrap using thick copper wire to strangulate. Oh that we would do this in a lobby of a large tower in downtown Miami to be discovered later that morning by office workers, the media, and emergency services.  Oh that we would then suddenly arise like clockwork and sing in Farsi about our fascination with riding on tandem bicycles in Lebanon with large Lebanese women who are psychologists by profession and then construct towers of digital clocks that are covered with green and blue tiles and take turns pushing one another in a wheelbarrow around the towers rigid like robots and in a stop motion formation as we chant in binary code about giant pink dandelions and injecting their petals into our bloodstream and then look upwards and scream for 20 minutes at a constant frequency of 3400 Hz.",-0.0772,174
