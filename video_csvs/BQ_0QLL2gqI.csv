"This is the sweetest apology song ever. I would totally accept it. Seriously people, instead of ghosting someone because you didn't feel a spark... you could give them an apology, tell them it isn't working out and wish them the best. But immature people just feel the need to not give proper feedback on their former relationship and just stop talking to the person randomly. If I had heard this, I would wish the best upon the other individual and taken the apology nicely.",0.9519,93

"You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last and
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
It's been some time, but this time ain't even
I can leave it in the past
But you're holding on to what you never had
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

Ooh, and I wish you would have waited for me but you always do

You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
