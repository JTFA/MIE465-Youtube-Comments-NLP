"Can we get a clich√© Sword melee Knight with Shield -hero?
He would have 1,25 Primary Firing Speed
100 Health, 250 Armor
*Primary:* 45-45-60 Dmg, (3 consecutive attacks, 2.25 second pause, and 3 attacks again)

*Secondary:* Charges a AoE cone attack that deals 30-85 damage depending how long you charge, up to 1.5s (0,2-1.5s)

*E:* Blocks 85% incoming dmg with his shield for 4 seconds and is immune to disables like Orisa.

*Shift:* Dashes trough enemies (megaman style, legs forward back to the ground you know) and knocks up enemies hit by it. 

Pressing jump during dash causes Knight guy to jump and do a air spin slash that would hit all knocked enemies. also gets you to some highground areas. 

Dashing with Secondary block up causes you to run and knock enemies down for 0,75 seconds instead, but you cannot do spin jump slash thingy.

*Ultimate:* AoE dmg reduction for the team and himself. Gains 40% damage resistance for 14 seconds and grants all allies 25% damage resistance for 5 seconds
And oviously the sword slash animations would be super cool.",-0.9052,226

"I have a solution to the so called ""one trick"" problem. It sounds complicated, but it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to actually implement. 

I think the biggest issue here is the lack of information to teammates on whether a player is actually any good with a particular hero on a particular map. 

My suggestion is that at the select screen each player gets a small colored symbol above their hero portrait based on their win percentage with that specific hero on that particular map. Three colors: green, yellow and red. A hero on that map above 60% win rate would be green, 60% to 40% for yellow, and 40% and below for red.  

For example a player selects Torbjorn on Volskaya attack, which on paper is ridiculous but you see the green symbol above the hero portrait. That means that that player has an above 60% win rate with Torb on Volskaya attack. Conversely if that player has a red symbol with Torb on that same map it would mean that they have a 40% or below win rate with Torb on Volskaya attack.  If any player at Masters or above loses a map using a hero with a red symbol that player alone loses double sr (or more) for that match. If this system works you might move the red symbol sr penalty down to diamond but no lower than that. 

The symbol would only come into play after a certain sample size of say 10 to 20 maps. So if you see an attack Torb with a ""green"" symbol you should just grin and bear it because it shows that that player has a certain skill or strat with that particular hero on that map and he knows what he's doing. And if he continues to use his attack Torb with a red symbol he won't last long at that rank due to the double (or more) sr penalty.",0.9843,357
