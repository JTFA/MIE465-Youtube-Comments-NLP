"+Justin Ramirez What I did see was Georgia on the line of scrimmage and not get a call as well as him BLATANTLY stepping out of bounds during a touchdown play. The ONLY play that was valid that your dumbass mentioned was the face mask and no it wasn't ""rigged"" the ref missed it because by the time he turned to face the ref he was on his shirt. ""that shoved out QB helmet after the play"" You mean when he was getting up? I also fail to see how that changes the game in any way skill wise even if it was called. Also did you forget Alabama had an unsportsmanlike like conduct called on them earlier? ""same play that not one but two of your players jumped and there were no false start called"" You mean when Alabama false started and called a penalty? I remember that. Twice actually. ""the WR that jumped early on that game tying TD"" Was behind the line of scrimmage when the ball was hiked. Jesus dude, you need to calm the fuck down.

"Again with the oldest and played out excuse. That excuse is so pathetic it's not even a joke anymore. Those refs were from the Big 10 which hates Alabama. They called penalties on Alabama the whole time, especially in the 1st half. What did win the game for Alabama was changes made in the second, player changes such as quarterback and play calls. Georgia played great in the 1st half, but didn't keep up with it in the second. Alabama played poor in the 1st half, but great in the second when it really matters. Georgia played great and deserved to be there, but it just wasn't their year to win. They will get stronger, better and make it all the way again, and I have no doubt they will win. This year was a win for Alabama fair and square. So I'll laugh with Alabama's 17th national title. I laugh with the greatest coach of all time since Bear Bryant.

"I believe there is true science and fake science, or scientism, a fake religion disguised as science. For the most part what the mass media teaches is false in order to hide the existence of God. I personally believe the Bible is 100% truth and that more recently with the release of television since the 1920's they have managed to lie to everyone, the created televisions exactly for the reason of mind control. There's patents and all kinds of proof of this info/facts. I haven't met Jesus my self, but I think he is God, he created everything because he was bored and we're here for his purpose. I've been doing lots of research to disprove or to further prove and from what I can find is that the book is all true. How would those men thousands of years ago be able to predict so many years ahead is beyond me, it's not for me to understand because I didn't create life, but the breather of life does understand, so I just have to have faith. While doing flat earth research I realized how lost most Christians are, actually most are fake Christians, they believe a lot of lies, but that's not to say their aren't real Christians out there. Also I started to understand the Bible better and learn so much awesome stuff along the way. I believed in the globe lie for 37 years, and once I learned this info it really improved my existence and my being, I don't get depressed anymore and I don't waste my time thinking about vain things like girls and cars and just so much shit that doesn't really matter. Plus I found out about things like how to see through lies, it really improved my being in that I'm not as trusting anymore, so I don't get screwed over like I used to get screwed before when I was too trusting or gullible because I didn't know any better. I'm still doing research but overall I would recommend everyone do research because the government can't be trusted and if they know the truth, which they do, but keep lying to us, there must be a reason, it's up to us to figure out what that is and also to stand up against the system, doing research just helps over all to stand up against this evil, all those bastards are players and they can't be trusted, they playing us like a fiddle, television is just mind control. I remember growing up I used to watch a lot of Disney and Nickelodeon and well that shit just fucked me up, and I didn't realize for so many years why my life was going the way it was going until I started to do the research and things started to add up. Luckily I didn't die before learning this stuff or I would have never known, like a lot of people who get brainwashed and never wake up from the ""american dream"". It's very liberating and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Along the way you may go back and forth and change your mind about stuff, like oh maybe hitler was a good guy, oh no he wasn't or so many other things, but then when you learn even more you end up being able to see what up much faster, just have to keep going and know that nothing is set in stone, facts are facts, and history has been rewritten, but those who re-wrote it aren't gods they just people and people make mistakes, so we just have to find their mistakes and dig around the haystack for that needle, truth is like a drug, once you find it you want it more and more.",0.9684,685

They missed the facemask on Swift when his head was completely turned. They called nothing on Mack Wilson for shoving Jake Fromm in the back of the head after making a tackle. They didn't eject a player that punched a Georgia player in the face. That same player is one that made a stop on a kickoff inside the 20. If he's not in the game, does that happen? They missed a holding call on Damien Harris on a Roquan Smith blitz. He still got to the QB, but at the same time, that's not a call that should be missed.

Gotta be the same question for UGA in their post-game presser. I mean,m why would it take the #1 & #2 teams in the nation 180 minutes to get the same number of sacks UCF's defense had in 60 minutes against Aubuirn ?

"I understand they tell us that we have GPS because of satellites, but if there are so many satellites up there in ""space"" then how come we never see or hear about any of them crashing? and if there are really satellites up there then why do we need all these towers? I know they use the towers on the ground to do the GPS. There are lots more questions that can be asked. How come all the images NASA and other space agencies show us are CGI(Computer Generated Images)? and How come after all these years we don't have a real image of the ""globe"". There is such a thing as true science and fake science. It is also possible to lie with mathematical equations. Lets look at this simple problem in basic algebra, if we have a half a cup of water, we can say that it is half empty and half full. Let's say E is for empty and F is for Full. 0.5 E = 0.5 F, that is a true statement in math and in real life, but what happens when we multiply that by the number 2? In math we validate the correctness of an equation by multiplying both sides by a number. So then if we multiply both sides by 2 we should have the answer. 2 * 0.5 E = 2 * 0.5 F this in math is a correct result, but in real life, an empty cup doesn't equal a full cup of water. This goes to show that Einstein could conjure up a equation that in mathematics and imagine it is true, but when we look at it in real life it doesn't make sense. Please do some research, here's a link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOGa8OQzjQ4&index=9&list=PLYI8318YYdkCsZ7dsYV01n6TZhXA6Wf9i Please watch the other videos in the playlist too. There are so much more question we could ask, it's just a matter of doing research to answer them! If there is such a thing as gravity then why is it picky what should float and what should stick to the ground? Why does a helium balloon float and an apple falls to the ground? If the earth were really a globe then there would be a curvature we could measure in real life and if it were a globe then a person at the north pole would weight less than a person standing at the equator. If you throw a wet tennis ball why does the water traverse to the center and fly off of the tennis ball and not on the spinning globe? If we were spinning then why don't we feel dizzy all the time? check out these other videos! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeIGrEtPMmE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARp2j8t3O8Q",0.4131,487

Go find the rule book for college football and when you have knowledge of what is a penalty and what isn‚Äôt you can come back and talk to me. Until then don‚Äôt be a fuckin idiot. Come to me with actual knowledge. Alabama received the title of National Champs because the refs gave it to them.,0.7269,174

Repent and put your faith in The Lord! 

Jesus loves you! He is not angry at you! He does not hate you, either. 

The Lord came down in the Person of Jesus to die on our behalf, so that we may be saved. 

Friends, this is how much The God of the universe loves us. 

Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so don't let anyone or anything stop you from approaching Jesus! 

Call upon Him today, and He will save you. He will deliver you from your sins, wash you, and make you new! Hallelujah! 
This is what He has done for me! He made me overcome all my sins and fears. 

He will also make a Way to escape the oncoming judgement approaching this earth. He made a Way out by His Body on the cross! Thank You, Jesus!

So come as you are today, and allow Him to wash away the sins of your life. You will be forgiven when you seek Him with your whole heart. You don't need a fancy prayer, all you need is a little bit of faith and your heart. 

Time is very short, but our lives are even shorter. It's dangerous to die without Jesus, so please choose Him today. You won't regret it. Ever.

Georgia played great in the 1st half, but didn't keep with what they did in the 1st half into the 2nd half. Alabama played poor in the 1st half, but played great in the 2nd half where it really matters. Georgia played great and deserved to be there, it just wasn't their year to win it.
