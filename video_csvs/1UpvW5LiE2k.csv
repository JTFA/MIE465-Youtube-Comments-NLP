"Dabalo, Just a Lemon With Lemon needs Yeah is a popularity game during this period. But then when you gotta say how good a player has been everyone says 'he has been All-Star X5 times'. Or when we compare players, I see loads of people saying 'Nah this is better. He has been All-Star X5 times, the other one only 1X times.' Then, what does it have to do a the All-Star game with players' skill if it is a popularity game?

I mean, we also consider the All-Star as a way to measure the seasons a player has been in the elite of the league. So the All-Star should be for the ones that deserve it. Or if it's gotta be taken as a popularity game, then dont consider the All-Star a skill based achivement when It insterests us. But dont mix both situations. You feel me?",0.9456,169
