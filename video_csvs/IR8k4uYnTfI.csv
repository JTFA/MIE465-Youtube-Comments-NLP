An embedded computer I.E. a Micro-ATX FM2+ plus a A10-7800k (Kaveri) and 256GB of DDR3 RAM and 5TB SSD drive might be better than an Arduino micro computer as it will give you access to long doubles which should make for more accuracy and a much more pleasing finish and the integrated graphics can drive a LCD display so that you can see what you are doing without having to use a desktop and you could keep your Gcode files in a My_Gcode_Files on the SSD inside the 3D printer.,0.7645,100
"As for non Marlin printers, I have one. Its the CTC 3D Dual which is a Makerbot clone, running Sailfish. Its definitely...erm....not as refined. 
But I believe even higher end printers like Ultimaker, Lulzbot, and of course lower end ones like Monoprice I3s and such are running all pretty much Marlin.",0.7184,63

"Darren Kitchen It'd be awesome if you talked about the most popular tools included with Kali. Just anything that resembles the good ol' hacktip days :)

(It'd also be awesome if you could make a series on Raspberry Pi's in computer security, but that might be inaccessible to some people)",0.8688,55

"David Randolph Hey David, just had one question. If I wanted to activate a servo motor for about 1 second whenever the extruder of the printer moves above a certain vertical point, what software would I need to edit to make that happen?",0.2732,47

"HAK5: I know this is more of a ""proof of concept"" deal and not a serious way to brute force numeric passwords, but couldn't you do the same thing with an array of linear actuators tied to an Arduino board? It would be compact, portable, easier to deploy, and a heck of a lot quicker than waiting for that turtle to type one number. And, you won't have to hang around holding the damn thing in place because the keypad being used is on a wall.",0.1806,98
"Hak5, has a good idea, but maybe we can hide it in plain site. Craft the printer so it can be disassembled and reassembled to look like a leg brace. Then when they ask about it, just chew them out for discriminating against the handicapped and cite the ADA.",0.4854,56
Hey Darren. Couldn't help but notice that you have a gear s3? How are you liking it? I love mine but perhaps you could let us know your thoughts on smart watches and the associated security risks as well as some of your favourite apps that you run on yours?,0.951,54
"Hey, your camera is offset. Not in level ;)",0.2263,11
"I also have one, the Frontier model and also love it! By way of security I would assume (with no research to back this up so don't quote me!) that because Samsung does not use the generic smart watch OS that most other android smart watches use, it should have a higher level of security over other smart watches.  Now this isn't because their operating system is more secure, but following the thought process that it is on less devices, so it is less likely to be a target for exploitation research.  Playing devils advocate though, because it is their own system, there are less eyes on it meaning less bugs being found before it is release/updated.  I second your request though to get a Hak5 video detailing the security of modern smart watches!",0.9095,151

"Oh....gosh.......wow.....ummmmm................ I really don't know how to feel about the law enforcement tech support situation. I just don't know how to feel about that.

Is there some way this is justified?",0.7985,79
"Pretty sure it has to do with something the inventor of the ATM machine found out... Most people (like his wife) can't remember more than four digits. (True story. He was going to go with a six digit pin, but his wife couldn't remember it in testing. Soooooo four digits it is.)",0.4118,62
Rob T the point is to introduce all the cool things you can do with G Code with a 3D Printer brute forcing a PIN code as the example.,-0.3182,30
