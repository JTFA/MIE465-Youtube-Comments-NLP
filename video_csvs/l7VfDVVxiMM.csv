"Here's something for you to try.  I think the proto putty mold has hope for slightly better results.  The main problem with the mold in this video is that the molten aluminum mostly rolled off of the mold and didn't fill the smaller gaps.  It kind of looked like the surface tension of the aluminum prevented it from filling them in.  If you could either make a way to introduce the molten aluminum more slowly and evenly throughout the entire mold or simply make a larger mold, it might yield better results.  Of course the putty will still catch on fire, dry out, and crack the way it did in this video, but I think there is still a possibility for making a semi-decent aluminum cast with it.",0.2862,138

I would like to see how far you can take the Proto-Putty with heat and cooling before the structures break down and become unusable.  Specifically I would like to see how well it could be used as a valve cover gasket replacement for an older car which parts are not readily available for.,0.7269,55

"Instead of using cornstarch it might work better to use powdered Calcium Carbonate (Available many places that sell vitamins/minerals) and or grind down some ""chalk"" into powder. Calcium being an element, has an extremely high resistance to heat (it's melting point is 825 ¬∞C / 1517 ¬∞F) Even though the silicone itself can only handle around 300 ¬∞C / 572 ¬∞F  the addition of the elemental calcium may help increase it's resistance to heat. Also I've seen many of your casting videos and wounder why you have not yet tried casting metal in moulds made of ""Plaster of Paris"" mix? It's available at most hardware stores (and is very inexpensive). It's also been used by people to cast since the 15th century and can withstand temperatures up to 1,200 ¬∞C / 2,200 ¬∞F.  

Unfortunately since this reply is about a month after the video was originally posted it's highly unlikely anyone at ""The King Of Random"" will even get to read this.",0.6705,189
