"Brandon Hopper they don’t just do taxes. It’s about the ecosystem of Intuit products. They have TurboTax for taxes, QuickBooks to run your small business and Mint to track your expenses. A lot of small business owners don’t have the resources that big companies do to take care of their finances. QuickBooks gives them that power through simplicity so they have more time to spend on the business they love versus on the books.",0.8126,86

"I feel like those dislikes are fake, man. This was a really nice way to work in the ad and also make it something people wanted to see. This reminds me of when games had ads in them back in the day (not as common now) but they would be like branded vending machines and such. It was executed well and I didn't feel intruded on (also I knew it was from intuit anyway but it was a surprise how it was incorperated).

This made me feel warm-hearted and that's what I want people to feel when they play my games. This was great.",0.9562,115

I must say that this is by far the best Ad that I have seen in years! This is the way to go intuit! I like the fact that it shows the empowerment of women in such a positive manner. This is such a refreshing inspiration after years of being force fed third wave feminism by blue haired socialist she/he donkeys with pronouns I can not even pronounce let alone remember. This ad to me highlights the true meanings of equality and the hope that small business can still thrive in a country dominated by large corporations and special interest. I must admit I got a little something in my eye on this one! Keep up the good work!,0.9817,128
