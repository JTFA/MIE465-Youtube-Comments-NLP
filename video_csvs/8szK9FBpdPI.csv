"""Hell no""",-0.7783,4
"""You are what your record says you are."" -- Bill Parcells. Right, we all know it, but let's not get too caught up with hindsight bias. If you could replay all of the Marvin Lewis' playoff games he might win some. The 2005 Bengals team was strong, until the Steelers took out Carson Palmer's knee. The 2015 Bengals were also strong, until melting down against the Steelers (again) with the infamous sequence of the Jeremy Hill fumble followed by the ridiculous Burfict and Jones penalties. Conversely, Belichick's Super Bowls have all been close games. And what would Belichick's career look like if he hadn't lucked into the greatest draft steal of all time (Tom the GOAT Brady in the sixth round)?

I'm no fan of Marvin Lewis or Mike Brown, but I'm also no fan of the ritual firing of coaches over factors largely beyond their control. All coaches on the NFL level are good enough to win if their teams get lucky in the draft for a few consecutive years. Firing the coach is largely a sop to the fans, a usually empty gesture to make it look like the team is ""doing something"" - when the only real cure for failure in the NFL is time. You just have to wait enough years for your team to get lucky in the draft crapshoot. It is as simple as landing a rare talent like Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, or Aaron Rodgers - quarterbacks who single-handedly add about five wins to your season, turning mediocre teams into first round playoff byes. Everywhere Manning went he made his coaches look smarter.",0.9929,304

"@ Daniel Mocsny- Who cares if there is some revenue sharing between the teams? How does this benefit the fans (the investor)? So this is the real basis behind the teams being fine about mediocrity and not caring about what the fans think, right? As long as the owners share the revenue among themselves, they go home happy, while fans are left angry. How many fanbases are out there for teams (who've never never been to or won a Superbowl) who are being brainwashed to be loyal to finance them? If you stop supporting them, then people attack you as being a traitor. How many teams (like the Cowboys) get overhyped (through aggressive marketing) and have been turning their fans psychotic for the past 22 years? Do you work for the NFL and been sent on their behalf to sell their Kool-Aid/doughnuts (convincing arguments for their business model) to deceive fans? The NFL has become like one giant doughnut shop company (lol, Krispy Kreme franchises)- sugarcoating their products and selling them to the masses while they share the revenue and leave their customers with health bills (cavities, obesity, heart disease, poor blood sugar control, etc.). It's just become an addictive drug that offers a false sense of happiness for fans. The fans become addicted and psychotic.",0.9341,255

"Anyone saying ""but look at how bad the Bengals were BEFORE Marvin,"" guess what? That was **14** years ago.

Marvin's job was to make the franchise respectable again. He did that. But once that's accomplished, you either take the team to the NEXT level or a true owner/GM fires you and gets the next person. But Mike Brown is not a true owner or GM.

Only two current HCs (Reid, Belichick) have HCed more years than him. Belichick's accomplishments speak for themselves and say what you will about Reid (and lord knows I've said plenty) but an 11-13 postseason record with a SB appearance and five conf finals appearances **dwarfs** an 0-7 playoff record.

Even more galling: there are only 25 coaches IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE LEAGUE with more years as HC than him. Repeat: *THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE LEAGUE*! 23 of those 25 coaches have at least one NFL/AAFC or NFC or AFC title in their career. And EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM won at least one playoff game in their careers.

People loved to give Marty Schottenheimer shit for underachieving. That dude was the Belichick of his era compared to Marvin!

And there, in fact, have been several instances where the Bengals underachieved with Marvin as HC. Their playoff losses to the Jets and Chargers come to mind. The 2006 and 2007 teams went 15-17 when both were playoff-capable.",0.774,278

"It's disgusting how selfish and greedy NFL owners have become. As long as they get their money, they're happy. They're not held accountable by anyone- they don't even have to be held accountable to their financiers/investors (the fans). Lol, come to think of it, a lot of executives of American companies don't care about the defective products they sell to the public- they'll overhype and sugarcoat all the deficiencies and con people into buying them (products made of cheap parts but overpriced/marked up). Have NFL teams been doing the same thing- overhyping and selling teams with mediocre personnel to their fans, as this will give more profits to the owners? I've heard Patriots fans complaining about not having the right personnel on defense which is giving up yards, but is able to limit points against them (through a red zone defense strategy). Lol, is this Belichick's tactic- save the team more money by skimping on getting good players and then just employ a red zone defense and let Brady take care of the rest? Why are teams reluctant these days to get the right personnel (coaching and players)? Is it to maximize their profits? As a Cowboys fan, I got a laugh out of Jerry Jones being disgusted in his luxury suite when Cowboys didn't make key plays against the Seahawks. But then again, not sure if that was an act for the cameras as he still goes home with money in his pocket from the fans he's got into buying his defective product- the Cowboys (for the past 22 years). When teams use tax payer money to fund their stadiums, the fans/citizens should have a say in managing the team. Regardless of even that, fans are still the investors of both the teams and the TV networks- so they should have a say- bc without the fans, the teams and networks would be out of business. The NFL has become ridiculous- milk the fans to the maximum by making them finance everything- and then give them nothing in the end (no say and no satisfaction). Lol, no wonder fans have psychotic episodes (e.g. aggressive behavior) as plenty of Youtube clips out there showing fans destroying their TVs and homes after their team loses.",0.446,433

"The comment about him setting back black people was UNFUCKINGcalled for. And I'm black myself. Shit ain't about race, it's about him and his mediocrity as a coach. Stephen A is always reaching like that. Hell, STEPHEN A and his far back receeding was hairline are the ones setting black people back if ANYTHING.",-0.7351,61
"The cool thing is that it makes no difference whatsoever whether we support this brother or not. The NFL likes to prove, over and over, that it doesn't need to care about what anybody else thinks. Mike Brown especially likes to give the world the raised middle finger. And the football addicted fan-tools just keep coming back. Football fans are like the girls who are helplessly attracted to bad boys who treat them like dirt. The bad boys just keep treating them worse to see at what point the girls will change - and they never do.",-0.8356,105
"The difference is that in a normal economy, the whole economy can grow and every company can improve. But in the NFL, the number of available wins is the same every year, and the number of losses must equal the number of wins. Bad teams in the NFL provide the valuable service of allowing other teams to be good for a while. The NFL's revenue sharing reflects this simple zero-sum reality. For example, while the Pats enjoy a run of success and draw in more revenue than the Browns, they share some of that revenue with the Browns, because sooner or later the Pats will suck and need other teams to prop them up.",0.9638,125

"The problem isn't coaching.  Its management.  A real NFL team becomes ingrained into the community.  When ownership shows a commitment to winning then the fans respond.  Go to Green bay, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, even Cleveland and the difference is incredible. Bengals fans are the least enthusiastic about their team because there is no real commitment by ownership to win or even stay within that community.  it doesn't matter who the coach is Mike Brown ultimately has full control.  With that being said I wanted them to get rid of the entire coaching staff.  Since he will never do that the next best thing is to hang on to Marvin Lewis.  Marvin Lewis is the only person who at least has some clout into at least steer Mike Brown in making a sound decision.  If he had fired Marvin then he would have just hired another flunky like David Shula and it would be an awful 5 years like we had under Shula.  I am a Bengal fan because i was born into it but i only take my commitment so far.  I never buy tickets or merchandise because i am not going to give mike Brown any money.  He doesn't deserve it.",0.6427,218

U just gotta be honest!!!!!! Marvin Lewis and the owner might possibly very well have a gay relationship with each other.....I wish my comment was a joke.....but something is going on between these 2 men......something very very deep behind closed doors!!!!!!!.....and I know it's no fair to put that on a man.....but basically Bengal fans......IM OUT OF EXCUSES!!!!!!!!!,0.7477,79

When did you become the VOICE of black America? You're just a clone/clown of C. Barkley. Marvin Lewis doesn't have a winning record so he brings shame to black people? Why can't he be JUST a bad or none winning coach. You sound like the FOOL that you are.,-0.9314,57
Who cares man blame them damn players. Thats the real problem. The coach cant tackle run pass or kick. I know the coach is a big part but its only so much Marvin Lewis has a winning record so the Bengals knows hes not a bad coach but the players gotta execute!,0.8056,56

Why does everybody assume normal people rules apply to Mike Brown? You can't put yourself in Brown's position and try to explain his behavior in terms of what would make you behave similarly.

Wow so Stephen A has a problem with Sam hinkie being bad because he's a white guy getting away with losing yet billy king was a black gm who literally killed teams hue Jackson 1-31 as a head coach lovie smith trash coach that got way to many chances and Marvin Lewis talk about a guy who's gotten to many chances I never want to hear him complain about black coaches ever because this right here is evidence that black coaches get more than a fair shake,-0.8508,87
