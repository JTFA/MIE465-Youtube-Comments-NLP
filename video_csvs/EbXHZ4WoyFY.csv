"Cavs is a locked!! He just wants to say something controversial! Toronto doesn’t have that killer instinct, Boston needs Hayward to be a complete team and they rely too much on their defense!! Cleveland has just acquired Larry Nance Jr a great defender and can play in the paint, Jordan Clarkson who’s automatic behind the line, Hood who’s going to ball, and George Hill as well. Along with all the stars they have already Cleveland is going to steamroll their way to winning a ship and they’re going to sweep GSW in the process WATCH!! All Cleveland needs is to acquire one more defensive player, TONY ALLEN. He’s out there just waiting to be picked up and Cleveland has a open spot for him as well! If Cleveland gets Tony Allen we may be talking about Cleveland sweeping the Warriors if not it’ll be 4-1 series win for Cleveland!!!!",0.9356,179
