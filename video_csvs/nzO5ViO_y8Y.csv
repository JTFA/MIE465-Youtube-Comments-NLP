Yes, representational artists focus more on observing, but also they are better and faster at observing as they grow in their craft. They also constantly idealize shapes, values, colors and edges when they are observing (which naturally create personal style) since they practice so much it became part of their second nature, whether they are aware of it or not.

Anyway the fact is....I'm always frustrated when I draw because it's not what I want xD....and I grow up with so much anxiety  about it and public art school make it even *WORSE*     .... and this video make me feel even worse because I never fucking get the actual point of this type of experiences...I just feel like I'm an alien all my fucking life and it's annoying  😂",-0.6344,188
