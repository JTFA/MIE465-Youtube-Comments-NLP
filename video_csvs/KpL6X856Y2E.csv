"Desert King I know, I spent a little too long in the south than I should have and know all too well the superiority/inferiority complex that dominates southern society and culture. When you have an entire society of people that for the most part is completely isolated from the rest of the world and only cares about their own desires and political agenda while also trying to force that on the rest of the world is when you know you have a problem. When I in what I like to call ""redneck land"" , I wouid be laughed at and made fun of just for having long hair and riding a skateboard yet whenever I was driving around it changed from being bullied/made fun of to screaming at me and cursing my name because I didnt cater to tailgating pickup trucks and most of the time even drove in the left lane (whats known to rednecks as the passing lane) on purpose with ""I love southern california"" and ""I hate louisiana"" on the back of my car to add insult to injury which actually worked in warding off tailgaters because the last thing a redneck wants to see while driving are stickers basically saying ""I'm an outsider and your state can eat a dick for all I care"" which pissed off the tailgaters with enough balls to tailgate me for longer than 5 minutes so much that one of them actually drove on the shoulder of a bridge just to get ahead of me because I wasn't willing to drive at at 180 miles an hour while driving in the left lane which I still don't understand how most southerners can drive as fast as they want and most of the time cops wont touch them while when I used to do it cops would chase me down and acted like I had just robbed a bank. yeah i know about southerners all too well and am just glad i finally had my revenge my stabbing all of them in the back, betraying everything their society believes in to become a Californian the one state that always ruins all of their plans to make the rest of the country just as conservative and redneck and southerners are which is why they hate us so much and wish for the complete total annihilation of California and everyone in it.",-0.4271,418

Only the one who give life. Only the one who created it all. In his name you shall not perish but have everlasting life John 3:16. We are all his creations & if you don't wake up, you'll be destroyed too. *Google* 2Chronicles 7:14. That is the only way you can & will be safe. Jesus Christ is the creator son, whom he sent to save those called by his name. Are you called by his name? Will you call upon his name despite of who rejects you? Until you see the truth, you will never be safe. He will pardon, who he reserved Jeremiah 50:20. Remember this daily & every time you see ""natural"" disasters. They are not Natural, the creator didn't create it to destroy it. Think about it. Shalom.",-0.9726,236

a lot of people that is making this out to be a joke I had a premonition about New Orleans flood before it happened and it did indeed happen and people died these dreams are not always accurate you have to turn them around it's like a puzzle that you have to put the right piece in the right place you cannot see into the spirit world unless you are chosen you cannot see the spirit world unless you are on your Deathbed the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost spirit is real when disaster do hit this world people are not going to believe what they are about to witness God wants you to know that there are things beyond your imagination if I could tell you the dreams that I have had you wouldn't even believe it and yes mermaids do exist they live deep in the ocean they're not allowed to come around humans God forbid it when you are a true follower of God he shows you  things that you never seen before I had birds pecking at my windows trying to communicate with me I seen Spirits right before my eyes come in my living room it was three of them they had on long white gowns and White veils over their heads you could not see their faces because it was a blur I was sleep at the time but as I started to open my eyes slowly they start Vanishing away and no I don't take any type of drugs and I am not on alcohol I know what I saw and this is the truth this world is coming to some truth that people don't no this world we live in is a make-believe world the spirit world is the real world when people die they just go back home where they from but if you sell your soul you don't make it back home you goes to the gates of hell why do you think Satan work so hard he doesn't want you in Paradise he wants you in hell,-0.8829,350
