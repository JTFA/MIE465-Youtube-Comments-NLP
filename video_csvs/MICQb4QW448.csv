Huy Fong's sauce is more like ketchup. The original sauce from Siracha province is more like a super hot, vinegary version of ""Cholula"" or ""Tapatio"", and it goes PERFECTLY with Seafood - which is what Siracha province in Thailand is known for. 

I have no hate for Huy Fong's sauce, it actually is way more versatile and goes with so many other things, but it's sad that the original sauce from Thailand goes un-noticed whilst Huy Fong's became a megastar.

Sriracha is delicious through and through, the heat is an added bonus.  Seriously, no recipe I have ever made featuring this sauce has ever turned out poorly.  It's great for any application where any hot sauce will do, adds kick to dishes otherwise lacking, and when combined with melted cheese is fantastic for dipping (or slathering atop a grilled mushroom for a heartier meal).  Sriracha may be a generic name anyone can use, but Huy Fong truly makes the best stuff and I never buy anything else anymore.  If it's a cheaper copy it's cheaper for a reason, and if it's more expensive it's just trying to ride off the famous name and trick people into thinking more money = more better.
