It's the same for me. My dad is from Northern Ireland, but I was raised in the South, yet I speak with a Northern twang. It's because I hear his accent, and my family's accent, so I'll speak like that because it's what I'm used to hearing, even though I was raised in the south.

"New to the series, and I did scroll down and saw all the comments.  Some suggestions:  If the actors are there IN EFFECT plugging their latest movies, either have the movie name on screen or in the YT description.  And, if their dialogue is important enough to cut to a video of someone mentioned, have a caption give the person's name/ project.  For example, early on a ""Alexander"" is mentioned with a cut away of him.  Who dat?
Too picky? Well I would think that Variety wants to be inclusive so that many can get into whomever is being shown.  And the actor's publicist would want maximum attention to the project being flogged.  Don't hate.
As to the actors - love them both.  I wish Kristen would never age, but I think she'll do so well. Saoirse's dress is not my fav - isn't flattering showing her right leg so.",0.58,172
