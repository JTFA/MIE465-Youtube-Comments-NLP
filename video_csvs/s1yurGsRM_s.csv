I mean, I'd imagine there are 2 types of women (in context):
1. Always, always, always wear a bra, at least when going outdoor. In which case, she's ridiculous to forget to wear a bra to a TV show.
2. Indifferent, to wear or not, either way is the same. In which case, she would've just gone braless herself, especially since she was wearing buttoned up blouse + jacket.",-0.6767,100
