"Hey Kitten Lady I have a question for you, please answer asap. We have a stray cat in our yard that I've been feeding for the past couple of days? we found him/her about 2 days ago. anyways the cat dosen't trust us enough to come near him/her he/she doesn't look to be in distress but it is starting to get cold outside and we'd love to bring him/her into a warm home I don't think he/she is feral because she/he just scampers of if we come near. so what i was wondering is should i continue feeding the cat and try to build it's trust or should i try to catch him/her quickly and work from there. I wanna do my best to help this cat get into a warm loving home, any tips would be appreciated. also I called my local humane society and they told me that i shouldn't try and trap him/her without a professional. what do you suggest? of course if he/she is a feral I will go through a TNR program but I gotta get a look at him/her first.",0.9826,217

"I am currently 15 and have always wanted to help cats in any way I can. When I can drive a car next August, I plan to volunteer at my local humane society. What do you think that best options for me would be after high school? I would absolutely LOVE to create a cat sanctuary similar to this one, and even have a few names in mind for it. How would I go about being able to rescue cats and kittens? Is it something I would need to go to collage for? I have wanted to be a vet for quite some time now, but it seems like maybe that isn't the perfect thing for me. I would like to rescue cats in need of a home instead of cats that already have a home because I feel that many people want to be vets and don't completely explore their options. I just want to see what jobs would be what I'm looking for and what I need to do to achieve my goals.",0.9571,187

I would most definitely adopt a cat or kitten but I live In Ireland and it would be a risk to have the kitten or cat on a flight over as they might starve or get dehydrated and they would lack social interactions from humans I also already have 3 cats and they are already a lot to handle this place is an excellent idea and a lovely environment for the cats and kittens living there id hope to see thousands of adoptions rather than 52 a year but it is impossible to have thousands of adoptions if you only have 580 cats,0.8456,103
