"DJR, for the same reason human penises are much larger than our great ape brothers' penises. We're not the same species, so we're not the exact same in all things. It's not weird for humans to deviate from our great ape siblings.

As for tribe women spreading out their cycles to ensure 'someone is always fertile', I would say this cannot be true, for the simple well known fact that women in the same household/community have a very strong tendency to sync up, rather than spread out. 

And 28 days can easily be completely random. If data shows no correlation, why must there still be one? Why can't it just be random? If our great ape sister have cycles of 37 or 25 days, why wouldn't we just have 28? Seems like the other ape cycles are a random amount of days, why not ours? (I'm sure there are factors involved, perhaps ones that are no longer a factor and I doubt someone threw a dart at a board to pick an amount of days, but you know what I mean with random. Not lunar related anyway.)",0.8711,215

It seems highly likely to me that human's reproductive cycles used to be much more in sync with the lunar cycles when we lived in closer connection to the natural world. I find it difficult to believe that it's just a coincidence that ovulation just happens to be in alignment with the period of time it takes the moon to complete a cycle.

Doesn't it make sense that the community would have had to be much more on-guard and on high-alert when there was a full moon?

The other theory is that a very balanced reporting of ovulation days might point to a correlation of spreading out the fertility evenly throughout the tribe, always balancing the chance of conception evenly over any particular day. Doesn't the correlation depend on what result you are specifically looking for? This may be devolving into a question of semantics, and I have no interest in debating word definitions here.
