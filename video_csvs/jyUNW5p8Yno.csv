"I doubt this will be anything good. Hyperkin only takes cheap Chinese clone crap and slaps their branding on it. The only time they haven't, is when they stole (good) software to power their Retron 5. Were caught, and knowing they can face no legal action from those which they are profiting off of, continue to sell the product. (In addition to making the subcontractor responsible  for said stealing sign legal documents so if anything ever were to happen. Hyperkin would get off scott free.  This guy is some white dude living in China peddling the same stolen crap thinking he's legally immune there to other companies like RetroBit with their recent arcade box and the Japanese RetroFreak console) 

Their HDMI SNES/NES don't even process the video output of these systems properly as 240p. So you get output that has been deinterlaced and treated as 480i poorly with extra latency. Again these are just their standard taken clones from china with a terrible upscaler added inside. Stuff like Stella being licensed is a step in the right direction, but it was a horribly old and outdated version of it. Given they can actually improve that to close to later versions on their own being doubtful, the end product will probably have the same terrible picture processing as the NES/SNES consoles.

This just looks like they are taking existing GBPs and using the tooling from existing chinese shells and modifying them to make aluminum shells and using off the shelf existing backlight solutions with legit GBPs inside.  Or these are just taking the GB BOY GBP clones and adding the same as above on top.",-0.5267,300

"Regarding the Ultra GB, it's a neat product, but it has got competition. By who you may ask? Well non-other then by Nintendo and modders. With $100 you could by a 2DS (or a Pre-owned Nintendo 3DS family system) and an NTRBoothax compatible flashcard.With a 2DS you get access to the entire line up of 3DS and DS games, I'm sure you'll be able to find something you like there, as with the Ultra GB, it's a bit smaller I guess, On the 2DS you get wireless connectivity and download retro games, good luck with that on the Ultra GB. What about the GB games I can't get on the eShop you may argue back, well that's where the NTRBoothax card comes in, NTRBoothax is a hack for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems that gives you access to the systems kernal thus being able to give it a Custom Firmware (CFW). Closest thing I can compare it to is NTRBoothax being an Android root and the CFW being the custom recovery and ROM. With a CFW such as Luma3DS, you can install Homebrew software such as screenshots, wireless sending video streaming to a computer or emulation. With emulation you can play any game up to the fourth generation and certain fifth generation games. With Nintendo Switch Homebrew on the horizon, items like the Ultra GB will simply become more and more niche, if it wasn't niche enough already.",0.9782,267
