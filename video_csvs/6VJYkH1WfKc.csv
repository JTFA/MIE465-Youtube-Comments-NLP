"Sorry to play hater but this was one of the most overrated crossovers ever, anyone who saw Iverson crossovers or even Kobe, Jamal Crawford, etc. Harden's crossovers are not in the same planet. This crossover, first of all, he took 5 steps back after it so he traveled before he made the 3. He did totally try to embarrass the guy by pausing that long. Harden is bizarre in that he is always retreating and travels moving backwards which is unheard of in the history of the league. How refs are not calling travels on him I don't get, he routinely takes 3 or 4 steps backwards to create space before his set shots. It isn't even a jump shot. Harden despite all this is the most overrated player in the history of the league and blows LeBron out of the water in that regard. Pleas no one forget that Harden never showed up in any playoff series and choked time and time again. He also from everything i hear plays no defense and worst of all his stats are completely overrated as he is trying for triple doubles. And Harden, Westbrook AND Lebron are going for triple doubles and have the ball in their hand and every play goes through them so hard not to pad your stats that way. LeBron and Westbrook are at least great athletes and explosive, but Harden is the worst of all because he travels every possession and doesn't make his teammates better AT ALL. LeBron at least has that ability. If Harden is getting 40M a year then Lebron is worth 75M a year and Westbrook is worth 50M a year. Curry is also not worth close to what he is getting because he is so frail and when he isn't making 35 foot 3-pointers he isn't worth a damn, NBA R.I.P.",0.6948,339
