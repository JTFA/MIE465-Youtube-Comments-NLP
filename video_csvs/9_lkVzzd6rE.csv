The first time I encountered a rooster is attacked me relentlessly. That was until I was tired of shooing it away and kicked in in the head so hard it caused the rooster to backflip.

"When I was 3-5 yrs old I had a cute little banty rooster that was my pet, when I wasn't carrying him about he was my shadow. He was very colorful so I know exactly what this rooster means to this girl, total unconditional love and acceptance. I was so little I don't recall the details of what happened to him, but life was much sadder and much more confusing after that. That might have been the case (especially in my family) any ways, but I know I missed him greatly. There was also home movies showing us together and me carrying him about. I never felt the same until I had my first dog who I named Fanny, but my mother named ""Tippy"" she gave her away later (without asking or telling me, just as she did my pet raccoon that is a whole story in itself), and then I had only her son ""Boots"" who was also my shadow. He was just my pal, then one day my kid sister pointed out, ""Boots doesn't know how to do anything."" I had never bothered to teach him 'tricks' etc by then he was over 6 yrs old. So in just a couple of days I taught him many different tricks and he would do whatever I told him to do, but later he and I didn't bother about those after we had disproved that old adage, ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks."" OH YES YOU CAN! I only kept one trick to use and that was when I snapped my fingers Boots would jump right into my arms, and he kept one he liked to use because it got him what he wanted with almost anyone he ever met. That was for him to sit up on his haunches and neatly cross his front paws to beg, that with his cute face (he was a slick haired terrier with a white blaze down his nose and brown eye brow spots) he could charm treats and scraps from everyone. So he was smart enough to hang onto that one which I had taught him at over 6 yrs old. All sorts of critters can surprise us when we really get to know them.",0.9757,418

Yea chickens can be pets too. We had them in when I was a kid. In the middle of the city in Miami. My redneck Cuban grandmother had about 15 🐔 and 🐓. And some of them were beloved like pets. My grandmother spent about $400 once just to save one of her favorite hen's life when it got sick. That's a lot of money for a bird that cost about $10 bucks when we bought it.,0.8271,86
