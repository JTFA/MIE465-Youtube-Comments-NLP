There was just something about him and that house that felt safe and comfortable....like a friend. It was only when the scary men invaded the house in their space suits and had E.T. strapped to a table hurting him that I felt scared. In interviews, Drew Barrymore who played Gertie in this movie says she felt the same way. She saw E.T. as her friend and those tears she was crying when they were  in the surgery were real....she wasn't acting there. Because she thought they were really hurting her friend.",-0.2023,136

"The events of ET actually happened to George Lucas as a boy. However, the movie was shortened for run time. In reality, ET lived with Lucas for several months. In this time ET told George all about the historical events of his home galaxy. Most notably about the Rebellion that took place against the Empire. George was so inspired by this story, he grew up obsessed with bringing this vision to the rest of the world and created Star Wars. He even told his story to his friend Steven Spielberg and allowed him to create a movie based off of his experience. Following the success of Star Wars, Lucas decided to continue making them as it was an easy way to riches. He continued to flesh out the surrounding story to the best of his memory and filled in the gaps where he needed to.",0.955,158

But later, when he first enters the home, he‚Äôs a frightening monster. But after he and Elliot sit down and spend some time together, when Elliot sees their similarities and Keys‚Äô humanity, that‚Äôs when we get to see his face.
