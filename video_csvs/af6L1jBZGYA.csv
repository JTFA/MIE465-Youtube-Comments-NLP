Crazy day Some idiot found $1500 on the street near WalMart in today. He tried to give it to a police officer but the officer thought it was a prank and wouldn't accept it. So this idiot bought himself a phone and groceries out of the store with the money. This is where it gets hilarious. The idiot kept tapping on ...... See More,-0.8996,69
