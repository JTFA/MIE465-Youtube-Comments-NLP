What Feige might want to really consider is managing BOTH universes at the same time. If he has a good team of underlings that he can wholly trust at Marvel, that even seems doable.

First answer, I think the CG for Alita was a little jarring but part of me feels like that is what the director is going for. Now granted this may not be the final look for Alita but in a way her appearance almost gives you that synthetic feeling, reminding you that this is not a person. As to the second question I had mixed feelings on the trailer but overall it has left me more hopeful for an anime turned live action movie than previous films. Can't say if it will succeed but it has peaked my interest.",0.9663,135

I understand that she doesn't seem like she is ""physically"" there but I feel that is the best way to portray her around her low to mid to late teens depending on whether you are reading the manga or watching the anime.

Don't get me wrong, I am a huge JJ fan, but it was obvious Paramount had wanted a totally new take on Trek and let him have his way with the franchise.  Did it bring in new fans of the reboot movies, yep, did it alienate some older fans of the series, yep.  It has been said that the old movies were killing off Trek anyway, and I agree, Nemesis particularly was a deserved death knell, but I always thought the franchise died under it's own weight.  It had been going so long with tv series and movies all happening at the same time it was just to much.

Reality is, and this is not up for debate, Batman and Superman are two of the top 3 most recognizable and famous Superheros in existence and among the most popular literary icons.  Iron Man is not.  He became popular because Marvel made a good Iron Man movie in 2008 and build off of that and successful integrated the character into the MCU.  Now many people know who he is.  Read my comment again.  My point is that you don't need strong IP to find success.  Campea is saying no one would be interested in Batman Beyond and I am saying it could work.  Also, no one knows who 98% of DC characters are also.",0.9411,152
"I'm not sure why Paramount would be jumping at the chance to let Tarantino direct a Star Trek movie unless they are just grasping at straws right now to keep this franchise afloat.  I would disagree with John that trying something new is always a good idea.  I could stick my arm in the sink waste disposal and press the button and hope for a really good massage, but it ain't gonna happen.  Tarantino made his bones directing a niche style of movie, it's what he is famous for.  Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, etc, etc, they all have the same dark bloody style to them.  You don't ask the man to direct a film for you unless you want what he has.  He is an amazing director and I love his movies, always have, but do I want him directing a Star Trek movie, a franchise I grew up loving just to see Paramount and CBS flush it down the drain in the hopes of, I assume, pulling in younger audiences with effect driven action story lines?  No, no I don't.

"I'm very open minded when it comes to alita's look on this movie. The eyes to me are to emphasis on the doll comparison that's constantly being brought up in the manga/OVA movie.  Also eyes in anime are used to convey emotion and are one of the most distinguishable features when it comes to the differenc western /Japanese art style's. Alitas "" anime eyes "" as seen in the trailer are in fact being used in such a way.  ( scene her and Hugo talking )  We also can't rule out the fact it could be to help smooth out the edges of the actress playing the Alita. Some people may feel she isn't  the strongest actress. There's also the  possibility that this is just a visual thing to let the audience know this is based on a Japanese manga.   At the end of the day this trailer was handled great! A slow introduction was necessary for us to get our feet wet on the visual style of the character without feeling over whelmed.  Let's be honest most of us are going to watch this trailer more then once.  We got a good look at the cast and a glimps of some action scenes without feeling overwhelmed or having to much revealed.  Smart moves were made here. The 2nd trailer is where its going to really pick up.  So for me I'm here for this 💪",0.926,252

"It's easy to understand. X-MEN can not be part of the MCU. Even in the case of a reboot. 

Apocalypse - the first mutant - lived thousands of years before the X-Men. 
In the modern area, hundreds of thousands of mutants live among humans everywhere in the world. Professor X and Magneto are in their 50's at least. These two men represent the ideological cleavage of an entire race that has been shaking the world since the terror of Apocalypse.
Logan is 200 years old ! He participated in a war in which Captain America participated !

Now the 1 billion dollar question : How could Kevin Feige integrate all those notions into the MCU without sounding stupid and without braking his universe ? Answer : Duh ! He can't. That would be the worst retcon ever. Only a moron can't get that. 
X-Men just need a good TV show and spin-offs to treat all the characters in their mythology. Maybe on the Disney Streaming Service.

Just bring the Fantastic 4 in the MCU. No origin story. They went in the space or in the Negative Zone, the expedition went wrong, they came back with uncontrollable super powers and US goverment quarantined them without telling the truth to the press. 8 months later, after weeks of studying their new abilities, they decide to disobey the government by leaving the Baxter Building to stop the Docor Doom.

Okay but the statement said racist,-0.7227,6
"Okay, It is a different time now.  Dr. Strange can succeed because Marvel has created a popular film brand.  In the 70s, no one cared about Dr. Strange and Marvel IP meant a lot less to studios.  Hence, Captain America movies were not the top of the box office and he tried to rush one out in 1990 to capitalize on Batman's success.  Obviously I don't literally know this but Marvel movies before the late 1990s, early 2000s were colossal failures, so it looks that way.

Now for the second part, it is true that the IP for all Marvel characters except Spider-man is worth less that Superman and Batman.  Fans love the Marvel movies and that specific Iron Man character, not iron man in general as much.  MAybe i'm wrong on this, but because fans love the MCU, they are giving Dr. Strange a shot.  They are giving Ant Man a shot.  The movies are making them famous, when Batman and Superman were already famous.  Now, Batman Beyond is not well know, but I think they can do what Marvel did and make a really good movie and then build off of that.

"Re: Feige...I just can't see it. First off, Feige has always been a Marvel fanboy, but more than Marvel, he loves Star Wars. He loves Star Wars more than anything, if I'm not mistaken. If Alan Horn or Iger were to leave Disney (both seem imminent), I could see Kennedy taking over and heading up Disney with Feige as president of Lucasfilm. That's honestly the only way I could see Feige ever leaving Marvel. 

Also, why would Feige leave a position where has near complete autonomy for a thankless position under WB's meddling executives? He'd be going backwards, back to a time when he had little creative control on the X-men films and other Marvel films, pre-2008. That would be downright stupid on his part. And no amount of reassurance from WB would convince him, or me, that he'd have full autonomy on the films and their execution. No way.

And finally, as others have said, he's getting ready to play in the X-men/FF sandboxes. Those who know him know that, out of all the Marvel characters, the X-Men were his childhood thing, Marvel-wise. No way, he's going to leave that for someone else to screw up.",0.9741,235

We don’t know if Dr Strange was released in the 70 if it would have succeeded or not, that is total speculation. I said that he might not be the most popular character but lots of people know who he is (just like Iron Man) but if it was a good movie it could have been successful (just like Iron Man). I agree that Batman Beyond is made and it’s a solid movie it could succeed. I may have gotten you confused with the other guy and if so I apologize. I just hate it when people act like nobody knows who these characters are if they aren’t Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, or Spider-Man.

"That is just not true.  Look it up.  The 60s Batman show was a pop culture icon.  The Hulk TV show paled in comparison in terms of popularity.  Comic Books used to be more prominant, especially among children. 
 Superman was iconic before and especially after the 1950s TV show.  That is why the 1989 Batman was so successful.  People cared bout Batman.  A Captain America movies couldn't even get off the ground the following year.  

As for the last part.  I don't read comics but I am very aware of the history of popular culture and keep in mind most Marvel characters didn't exist until the mid 1960s, while a whole generation had grown up knowing Superman and kids were watching Superman and Batman on TV (there were only 3 channels keep in mind).  Superman had a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade in the 1930s.  The fact that DC is failing is all the more troubling because they have such an advantage of IP.",0.6186,182

"This notion presumes that there is a value to maintaining the ""brand"" even if it no longer represents the ideals the brand was founded on. The studio certainly wants to maintain the brand for financial purposes, but why should anyone else care? If it dies because no wants  to see an idyllic view of humanity in the future, then it dies.

Also, while not all films need fan approval, I think in Star Trek's case, it probably isn't a good idea to alienate the loyalists. Trek is already has a niche appeal. Even with the surge it got going mainstream for the Abrams reboot, it hasn't held onto that audience over the sequels and its never done stellar overseas.

I'm a a hardcore Trek fan.

"Wrong. The characters were well known among _comic book readers_ ...which has always been a tiny subset of the general population. Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman were all on cheesy TV shows back in the 60's. Same for the Hulk, though in the 70's, I think. The Hulk has been well known pop culture for decades due to the TV show. The reason those characters were better known was because of TV exposure, and then, in the 80's MASSIVE success in huge movies. Few people care about comic books. That's just nonsense for pimply nerds and their virginity. Even now, with the MCU dominating hollywood, comic books are struggling to sell. God I hope I'm not talking to a fanboi who thinks there is some sort of competition between DC and Marvel or that one is better than the other or whatever childish nonsense.

Spider-man wasn't as popular in the 70s as Batman or Superman, neither was Captain America.  Anyway, my point was not meant as a shot at Marvel.  It was saying in this day and age, comic book movies can succeed if they have an interesting premise and decent marketing to Beyond could work.  My point was that Marvel succeeded because they were good (In a post X-men/Spider-man 2002 era).",0.9709,137

It similiar with MCU by design but a bit different as they not come from 1 person controll (kevin feige). There is dangerous in this style as WB has tendency to pull the support as soon as they felt not good anough or come into new teritory...in other word they will produce several movie that they already know to be success but wont to excited to support something new.

same with superman, do a good job having a superman that is comedic and funny so he entertains batman, and plays off of jokes that batman tells
same with other justice league ppl, like wonder woman
put him and the other justice league characters legitimately in a scenario where we reintroduce robin , and batgirl and possibly introduce nightwing, and try to introduce a new storyline for catwoman as bats girlfriend, instead of a villian

f#¤% cgi and peoples constent overuse of it. I´M TIRED OF THIS BULL S#¤%! just don´t understand what´s wrong with hiring actors and doing practical s#¤% but i guess
if you want your movie to look like crap and you don´t care about people being put off, well that´s your choise james/Robert. similar or same mistake lucas did with 
the sw prequels?.. or just make f#¤%ing cartoons man!? if it´s what you really want, remake this s#¤%! no john you´re right she´s a digital fake f#¤%ing 
ghost that´s not there and it sucks... i like the background stuff, but they lost me with the stupid choise with alita, no way i´m paying to be distracted from what i 
payed to see. i´m starting to loose respect for filmakers i love... not just these 2... i get that avatar is cgi but i still think you could´ve made it more real
especially the characters & the plants but they seem to be getting orgasms from cgi... i used to get motion sickness from black and white movies as a kid, don´t know why. alita
could have the same effect perhaps, sucks. how long did this take to make? really groundbreaking guys... no no i mean it it looks so real, my mind was blown... not!
listen james/robert, shouldn't cgi be used as makeup? what happens when someone puts on too much makeup? i though the anger for lucas overuse of it in 
star wars 1-3 made that clear back in the day? so, terrible i guess... i´m so f#¤% tired of cgi...

i thought jurassic was spielbergs franchise?

we should celebrate all good comic book and manga movies, if they´re good we all win, dc, marvel or other doesn't matter. LOVE IT! if it´s good.

but john! thor is a god, superman i just a kryptonian... perhaps sups wins on earth with it´s yellow sun but....

do you think creating a.i. would help us get to superpowers :)? or at least immortality.

i hope they star pulling back on marketing. we´re the ones paying for it right? do we want to? i don´t.

rogue one´s pretty good, yip man´s nice, he´s in blade 2 & Crouching Tiger 2 but i´d say hero is my favorite with yen.
Wing Chun & once upon in china 2 has some good nostalgia perhaps :). was Highlander: Endgame with the guy from the tv show?

if they hire new actors for the dc movie verse i hope they use unknown actors, perhaps even stunt people to begin with. you know cause they
know martial arts, stunts and so on. martial art fighters or acrobats? just do it!

you could put dc and marvel together if you have a comic book movie parody perhaps? like you could mix star wars and star trek in a sci-fi parody maby.
