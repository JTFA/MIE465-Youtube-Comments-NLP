"I see the Far Leftist Fan Boys and Girls are using the same phrase over and over again to insult folks.

"I've been a fan for a long time, since the early 80's. I don't remember what I saw first, probably videos for New Year's Day or Gloria, but I became a fan with the beautiful black and white performance video for Pride, when I was probably 13. Life long fan ever since. 

Bono always spoke a message I could understand and follow and for the most part agree with. I seems as though he always wanted to help, make things better, and I appreciate his religious views. 

Now this. It seems to me that he (and the band) have changed views and are almost  ""jumping on the bandwagon"" of negativity towards the government in our country. In the past they have worked alongside conservatives and liberals. I will no longer take what Bono says as coming from an informed, intelligent person any longer, at least until he can at least sit and speak with  Trump to see if his opinion holds up. 

Everyone has a right to his or her own opinion, but base it in fact vs. what you are told. Or do investigation for yourself. As a conservative, I can tell you it's wrong to think we don't want immigration to our country. We don't hate  people that are different, despite what you hear on the news nightly. 

I will continue to be a U2 fan, despite the ignorance that has come from the band regarding our country. I'd be a hypocrite myself if I said I wasn't or couldn't be, because I'm usually the one saying ""not everyone involved with the manufacture of this product will share the same beliefs"", and remember that if you give too much weight to what anyone says or thinks, eventually, they will let you down, and not necessarily on purpose.",0.9875,340

Whether the media are spinning that or not, it was a moronic screwup not to come out and very clearly condemn the KKK side of that march, seeing as it was the KKK side's rage-driven overreaction which resulted in the deaths of people from the other side.

That one incident has forever cemented Trump's association with the alt-right among the European media, which presumably is where U2, being Irish, get most of their news from. All the rest of the world saw was a bunch of anti-emancipation, racist, violent white supremacists calling for a return to the 1950s, and using lethal force to put down those who opposed them.

That's prima facie evidence that U2 has joined the very establishment we used to collectively reject.  Very sad.  People who support basic American values - secure borders, rule of law, Bill of Rights, etc., have to be labeled as racist - actually the globalists have been doing this for decades.  So no matter how irresponsible or dishonest it is to paint Trump as connected with the KKK - literally absurd -  people we used to think of as having integrity are willing to become part of the machine of hatred and division.
