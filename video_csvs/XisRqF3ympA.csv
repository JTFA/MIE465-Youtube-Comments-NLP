All I want for Christmas is -- the Fenty Galaxy Eyeshadow Palette!!!,0.2905,16
Anastasia has one of the best eyeshadows formula ... but I don't think this palette is the best for a beginner ... try something with more natural colors,0.92,28
Get the Lorac 3 pallet! It’s one of the cheaper high end pallets in my opinion and it’s amazing! It’s my favorite pallet,0.8118,31
"Gotta love that Anastasia Palette. 
One of the things i look forward every single Monday is the ""Beauty with Mi"" segment. I really like it. Greetings from México! :-)",0.9473,35

Hiiiii harlie! thank you so so much for watching!!! <3,0.7627,14
I also just did a tutorial on this palette and I'd love if you'd check it out and tell me what you think!!,0.6988,25
I love how quick and concise each eye look was!  Really easy to watch.,0.8264,16
I love that green eye! Do you think that anastasia palette would be good for beginners? I really want to get into eyeshadow but I'm not sure what palette to get!,0.4566,34
"I love when you put make up, it is so calming. Especially because I could never put my eyeshadow and not look like I am late from a Halloween party 😉😃",0.8512,34
I loveeeee your top! Where's it from? :),0.6239,10
"I second that ! ABH palettes are AMAZING but in my opinion this palette isn't the best beginner palette because it has some really wonky colors. If you're looking for something still in the ABH range try the Modern Renaissance Palette! It's probably my favorite from the line. Drugstore wise, I love Wet n Wild eyeshadows!",0.933,61
I think the best beginner palette is the too faced chocolate bar!! That was my first and has tons of natural colors to get you started! Not to mention it smells AMAZING! Haha,0.9469,37
I want prism!!!!!!!!,0.3544,6
I want the too faced pallete 😍☺,0.0772,8
"I would recommend either Too Faced Sweet Peach or Too Faced Chocolate Bar palettes! The prism palette is gorgeous and I use it a lot for nighttime looks, but I definitely recommend starting with something more wearable 😊",0.8702,40

haha sorry that wasn't clear! Every year Too Faced comes out with a TON of amazing holiday launches from big shadow palettes like this one to cute little stocking stuffers. Whenever I see too faced holiday collections I get really excited for the winter season :) Thanks or watching!,0.9732,52

what song is at 6:45????????,0.0,8
yes ı am also a tati fan and ı think too faced disrespected her in a way that's why she ain't talking about that brand in her channel anymore.,0.25,30
