If you skim extra fat off the top you can get a more fatty, heavier milk basically.  Way too strong to drink, at about 30% fat, but it is used in cooking (Alfredo sauce is cream and parmesean), in whipped cream, literally whipping the cream to an airy wonder, and diverse sweets and treats.

Because I always keep returning to this channel when I am in need of relaxing. I just love the recipes and the history of it. For me it goes even deeper, because it is a means of escapism that I find in this channel, where mr. Townsend explains the earlier times and the way of living (which on the surface sounds simple and straightforward) but in reality is still quite complex and well thought. I know that because there is always something to learn, with every recipe and Q and A. I love the dedication and fascination to this way of living.

Quadrupled the recipe (i.e. used a one pound box of macaroni and adjusted the ingredients to match) and was even able to locate the ""straight"" macaroni. I did use half-n-half instead of heavy cream, rolled four 2-Tblsp ""balls"" of butter in whole wheat flour and used pre-grated, but fresh, parmesan. Placed the drained macaroni in my big cast-iron frypan, added cream flour/butter and it made its own sauce in four or five minutes over low heat. After adding the parmesan and folding it into the macaroni a bit, the whole shebang was toasted under the broiler (watch carefully) as I do not possess a salamander. It came out fantastic!
