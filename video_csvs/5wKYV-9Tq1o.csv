"SOS Tyler, I desperately need your help and advice! My friend is lesbian and she hasn’t told her mom yet. She is feeling very uncomfortable around her mother because of things she has said. Things like, “I don’t want you dressing like a boy” and, “I don’t want you becoming your sister”. Also her mother is very controlling takes her shopping and picks out all her clothes and chooses what she does with most of her free time. I am trying the best I can to help her but I can’t do to much due to the fact that I am partly in the same position. I don’t have anyone to go to for advice so I thought why not ask my favorite YouTuber?! Your the only one I could think of who would give me the best answer. Please help!",0.9635,168
