He also refers to children being safe from hell and each one of them that dies will be given everlasting LIFE. 
We're only here for.a very short time but our souls will last forever. Either in Life or Death(hell).

"CNCmachiningisfun - Where is your proof your phone didnt create itself? Or your house or car? 
Creation itself IS the proof, Einstein. The building is the evidence of the builder. 
I know that may be tough for you to understand, but stay with me..
We see pre-programmed microscopic cells more technilogically advanced in our bodies, than the most complicated computer systems we have. Pre-programmed. We don't know how they know what they are doing. The above video shows this...
And you say show me proof of a designer? Mom and dad must be real proud of you...
Let me put it together for you. 
We know that nothing created or existing, came about on it's own from nothing. Nothing creates nothing. 
So if we know the building is proof of a builder, I believe the onus is on you to prove to us that there wasn't a builder/creator. Because the evidence tells us that there certainly is a creator. 
Why my God you ask? Because [among many reasons] He's never been wrong and His Bible has stood the test of time. It's completely accurate and without error. Further than that, Christianity stands alone from all other religions. Every religion in the world puts it's emphasis and relies upon good works for a person to enter heaven. Christianity does not. Christianity relies on Grace. 
This is all free information you can find online if you're able to comprehend the overwhelming evidence we have. 
I don't believe you've done your research on anything about God or Christianity.
Sounds to me like you allow your emotions to dictate your thought pattern.",0.9904,304

It all falls apart.",0.8519,70
"CNCmachiningisfun - Wow.. so much anger.. did mom or dad lie to you? Is that why you accuse strangers of lies and things you know little about? Is that why you can't see past your emotions? 
Obviously nobody can say for sure how it all came about because none of us were there. 
But we happen to have a book. Accurately describing how it was created. Not in it's entirety and it doesn't give us a very detailed description, but what it says can't be proven wrong and all evidence points to it being true. That's called science. Evidence. 
If i told you gravity exists, can you prove me wrong? Of course not. Because every time you drop that apple(evidence), it will fall to the ground. So we believe it because all evidence points to it being true. We see no evidence of the contrary.
Same goes for the Bible. All evidence points to a creator, and more importantly, evidence is pointing towards the creator of the Bible. Which includes the ever important flood. 
Unfortunately you just haven't got evidence on your side. It's a little more important than your emotions.

I love science and all that we have discovered and invented from our discoveries, but the belief that everything came out of nothing and assembled itself without any intelligence behind it lacks logic. I choose to believe it came from a creator.",0.5017,141

About how they know where to go: there is a specific protein for everything in a cell (almost). Some of them only go from the center of the cell to the periphery, some others go the other way. They are also carrying specific molecules, it's not like they choose what they carry and where to carry it.
The cell can then regulate this transportation system by producing more or less of a particular kind of dynein, etc
