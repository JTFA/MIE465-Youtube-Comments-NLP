"THEREALSPEAKIN
Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with all that stuff. This sounds crazy, but I used to watch those guys on public-access TV back when I was a teenager in the 90s, when Yashiya and Ahrayah and Tahar were still with the old UPK before the schisms; some of these old videos on YT, I remember watching when they were on obscure public-access channels in the middle of the night.

My fascination with the camps goes back a long time. Are you with IUIC or another group?",0.743,95
"THEREALSPEAKIN 

""the term black hebrew israelite is something the media made up""

Fair enough; I know you guys don't call yourselves that, so I apologize for using the term.

"".i know you see alot of different sects bashing the so called whiteman, but my sect focus on teaching our ppl to comeback to the laws of god that was givin to us""

I follow most of the 'big' ones who have a presence online; I took a look at some of your 'liked' videos and I see a lot of IUIC in there; is that the group you belong to? If so, what's your opinion about the way groups like UPK and Sicarii mock and criticize IUIC all the time?

""the ppl that are jewish arent the real jews...they stole our nationality""

I actually believe this as well. As mystifying and intriguing as some of the camps' teachings are to me (which I know is to be expected from your perspective since in your view, I am Esau and a heathen), I think they're on-point in teaching that the so-called African Americans are the true Hebrews and that the modern Jews are the descendants of culture bandits. I also think it's very telling that the so-called African Americans are on the bottom everywhere in America, which is clearly indicative of systemic oppression of some kind.

I'm not as convinced about the Hispanics and Native Americans (though I agree that they are victims of white imperialism); I have several reasons why I'm skeptical of the claim that they're the same people as the so-called African Americans and would very much be interested in learning your/your group's responses, but I understand if you don't want to take the time to answer. I know you guys aren't out here to teach me or anyone other than the 12 tribes, so from your perspective it's not fruitful to explain yourself to an Edomite, but there's no end to my questions and my desire to understand y'all better.",0.9608,373
"THEREALSPEAKIN Naw, I'm just making sure I know what I'm dealing with here. That's you, right? A Black Hebrew Israelite? To tell you the truth, I'm fascinated with those guys, so if you're one of them, I'd like to ask you some questions.",0.8611,52

but since black people dont see cops as the protector/enforcer or law that i've been lucky enough to experience (and i know they dont) i truly wonder if that's why they are so confused about the right thing to do.
