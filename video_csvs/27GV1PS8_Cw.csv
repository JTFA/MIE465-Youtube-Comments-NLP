"All politicians are corrupt and in it for their own selfish agenda. The people no longer have a voice and never have. Let no one deceive you about this.

DO NOT EVER TRUST A POLITICIAN. They are their to protect the white shoe boys club only and that ain't you and never will be! That officer is just part of that same group. Its called give me the power group and I will use it against you ever chance i get. Disgusting! When you go to any City Hall Meeting whatever is being voted on has already been decided by the elite of that governing body. The mayor already has or who ever is in charge has already arranged to get what they want for other favors. Its NEVER about the people who actually do the work. All systems whether school or any local government are corrupt. If the person who ran for that office wasn't corrupt when he got there, he surely was and is after the fact.

If this teacher was following protocol - speaking during the ‚ÄúPublic Open Session‚Äù of a School Board Meeting - what was the charge??  Or, did she interrupt protocol/format and just stand up and start speaking?  I happen to agree with her line of questioning - however, as a teacher, SHE KNOWS A) during Open Session - the School Board Members, Superintendent and the rest of the crew sitting at that table up front cannot answer questions from the audience, B) during that time is a GREAT time to get ‚Äúon-the-record‚Äù and C) if she just burst out...she was out of order.  Having said that, I think that Superintendent is a sniveling cry baby just boo-hooing for the cameras and, frankly, SHE‚ÄôS not better...boo-hooing that, ‚Äú...if they have to remove a woman...‚Äù.

"He is upset because he got a lot of backlash - good. - If he thinks he needs to be better paid - go to into the private sector and see what you are ""worth"" to an employer. Why would HE get a raise when the whole system is defunded. And if the school performs well - who delivers that performance - ideally he mananges the teachers so that they together with the students create that performance.

He does need some skills - but an ADMINSTRATOR does not need to ""walk on water"" or be ""especially creative"" or have ""unique skills"". A lot of people could do the job - would they get the position (which begs the question HOW  or with which connections !! does one get into such a position ??). 

Other managers have to meet sales targest or need to have a product ready (meeting some criteria) or train staff - he has nothing like those challenges to meet. I would assume every good fast food restaurant manger has a more challenging job - and might be paid much less.

Nor does he have to deal with the really difficult situations (in the classroom with the students). He has to deal with orderly adults mainly (and if they do not show sufficient obedience he will use a Marshall to have them arrested. Big deal.",0.8375,255

I even sued them and I still lost.  I am bitter to the core and still am waiting for justice.
