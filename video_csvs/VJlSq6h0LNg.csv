"As I mentioned I think as fans we want to see or hear that fire to appease ourselves, but the truth is, we have no idea as to what happens behind closed doors in that locker room. Diaco and Riley have both made comments how they don't air their family laundry to the media, so they aren't going to call specific players out in front of the media, but it doesn't mean that isn't happening within the team.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's time for a change, I just don't get the Riley bashing.",0.5394,105

"Ben Sasse will be in Washington for a long time, he's a DC careerist who knows how to play both sides of the fence.  So will Jeff Fortenberry, who has been a corporate kickback rep since the early 2000s and who is very comfortable with his lifestyle.  Don Bacon not so much.  2 out of 3.  I don't put much faith in this Tea Party movement as it stands since 2010, it's funded heavily by the very same corporate interests who fund the establishment GOP, it's just a re-branding to sell the working-class on policies that don't really have their interests at heart.. The Democrats used to do this for much of the 19c. pandering to immigrant Irish voters.  Now the GOP has become the party of anti-intellectualism on a massive scale.  I'm not a fan of either party, but I see the GOP as a bigger threat to intelligent, reasonable policy since the mid 1990's.",0.7238,173
Bizarre arrogance on your part considering Nebraska is on the hook for his whole contract and will be paying him for the next few years his full compensation.  All this while the rest of the University is forced to make drastic budget cuts and reduce staff and facilities.,-0.872,50

"I get it, I would like more to see more energy out of him but maybe that's just for me to make it look like he cares more than what he does, but honestly how much energy did you ever see from Tom Osborne ? I believe you can still be passionate and show leadership without acting like Bo did. I do think this season has been deflating for him and his coaching staff, they had high expecations from the team and the team hasn't come through. This isn't all on Riley, players still have to play the game.",0.9813,106
"I get why people want a change with the coaching staff, and I don't disagree. I just don't get why people take it to the personal level and go after Riley with such an angry stance. Do you think he's trying to lose on purpose? Riley is a class act and deserves the respect from fans. I do believe he has lost the players and team and the team does need to make a change, and I wish nothing but the best for MR. I wish, I'm sure as he does that things were different, but no reason to personally attack this guy. The posts I see don't seem to represent the Nebraska culture that I've seen from fans at the game. I see more respect to our opponents than we have with our own coach.",-0.2168,148

"Look, we can bag on Riley, we can get grumpy with Diaco, yadda yadda.. the coaching isn't perfect.  But I'll be honest--this was the first season in some time that I came into as a Husker fan having a good deal of optimism.  We have three _great_ running backs.  Some good receivers, an improving defense, good recruits.  But sweet mother Mary, it's all for nothing with the INT KING at the helm!  The first 3 losses, we had not just a shot at winning, but _probable_ wins had it not been for what has to be record-setting interception numbers this year in Mr. Lee.  And OF COURSE it's easy to pick the guy off when you know that he will stand in the pocket for 15 seconds waiting for a receiver to get open instead of scrambling for a plus 5 or 6 yards.  I could see Tanner maturing into a great NFL passer someday, but this is *college football* Mr. Riley.  You're playing games with 20 year old kids out there... choose your players and coach the game accordingly.  I like you Coach, I really do.  But we have to have a QB that fits the college game.  (Oh, and a defense that doesn't just arm tackle. Damn that is glaringly apparent).",0.9811,245

"Voting for Trump has everything to do with everything.  I'm not on the left or the right, but I certainly had no intention of ever voting for a man who couldn't even reference any level of competence in American history, global affairs, basic geography or grasp the complexity of economic policy and actual scientific theory.  If you voted for Trump, you willingly voted for anti-intellectualism and undermining our republican traditions of representative government in the long-term future, you probably just don't know enough to see things beyond a R vs. D trajectory.  Trump is something very new, a demagogue and a would be emperor who has no respect for separation of powers.",-0.1531,123
