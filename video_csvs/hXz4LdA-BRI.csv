This kind of fun stat is nothing like sharing people‚Äôs personal data.

And as for the five subsequent movies, Fox has theatrical, nontheatrical and home video rights worldwide through May 2020.""

So, if the Fox/Disney deal goes through, as it seems very likely to, Disney will then own distribution rights on all Star Wars films produced-includling the original versions.  I can't find any word on George Lucas requiring that they never again release the originals, but that's no guarantee that there wasn't some such requirement.  Maybe...juuuuusst maybe...we will get a remastered Blu-Ray release of the originals if (when) the deal goes through.  A small comfort, to be sure.",-0.1531,180

It's hard to detach yourself from that, and you have to be really familiar with it to consciously uncouple from that mindset.

"Probably not a popular opinion but I think the Avengers should be added to the film registry. They add films for their cultural impacts and if you look at what the avengers has done you'll see. It's the most successful attempt as joining multiple film franchises together, it's influence cinema as literally everyone is trying to create their own shared universe now but credit to marvel being the only ones to do it successfully. Comic book movies now dominate the box office, yeah films like the dark knight and Spiderman did well before that but they were the exception to the rule at the time. Now literally every comic book movie makes a lot of money. Like Ant-Man actually made over 700 million, that wouldn't have happened before the Avengers. It's also influenced pop culture. I remember before the Avengers I was called a geek and a nerd for liking superheroes. Now it's quite common and being considered geeky isn't no longer an insult anymore, and I think avengers had a bigger role in that happening that any other movie",0.9815,192

So I have no hate for the people who stream things over and over again, I do have a problem though with Netflix calling people out for doing this, trying to be cute. I'm with Spencer, If they are receiving your money for a service, why would it be ok to make fun of you for using said service. Maybe this is just a comedic bit done by the person running the Netflix Twitter account, but imagine if there is someone who watched Pirates of he Caribbean everyday. I'm sure they wouldn't want Netflix sending out a snarky tweet about it.

"george Lucas directed the original Starwars film but his wife at the time edited the film and created it as the masterpiece that it became, they had a very bitter divorce and part of the reason why george Lucas re-released the special edition is so that his wife would not receive any royalties from the special editions as she was only involved in the original film which is also why he doesn't want to release the original film in any format. Wheres with the special editions he has full control over them.",0.9677,95

"part of spotify's premise is that it's a ""social media for music lovers"" i.e. if you have ""friends"" added on it, they can see what you're listening to and when. as well as the option of sharing your listening status on facebook. there's also the year in review where you can willfully share how many hours of music you listened to in the past year and your top genres. i feel like there is more of a precedent for sharing and statistics, and the sharing of statistics in the context of spotify.

netflix, by contrast, is very opaque. you can't add ""friends"", there is really no social interface (that is interface that connects you to other viewers) other than maaybe the rating system which i believe is an average of viewer ratings. because netflix is so opaque in terms of user interaction, as well as (as roth said) the fact that netflix is super tight lipped about their stats, there is less of a precedent for stats, sharing, and the sharing of statistics in the context of netflix",0.9788,206
