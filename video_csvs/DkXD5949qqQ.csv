"+Fredo Beno Oh thank you, for taking the time to admire my Profile pic. You think I care what, you have to say about me, you think I'm that insecure that I'd listen to a stranger. At least I have the courage to post my own pics instead of uploading a good looking celebrities one. You are in no position to be taking, when you have no pic in the first place.",0.8271,81
"+Lia Dini To each his own, I personally thought they sounded awful together, don't get me wrong I love Gwen and think she has a powerful, beautiful voice but Blake ruins it all, just because they are a couple don't mean they have to perform together (it's looks to forced and unnatural)",-0.4807,59
+M. Baysden Like I mentioned earlier I could care less if I looked like a male model or a mutant.,0.7867,23
"+M. Baysden Okay I'm sorry, if I offended you and the others, it wasn't my intention. I guess we live in the late forties where a boy can't have an opinion without getting lynched and taunted on social media. I thought we were past that, you don't always have to agree with me and vice versa. I still don't understand why you are being mean and resorting to childish games like insulting me, don't you think you are a little bit old for that.",-0.2023,94
"+M. Baysden Very mature and classy of you insulting me without a legit reason, your mother must have raised you right, anyway I'm not offended, I'm not going to stoop to your level and insult you back, you are clearly older than me and my mum taught me to respect my elders. About the profile pic situation, I could care less, I'm not one to focus on outwards appearance or looks, believe it or not there are more important things in life than being beautiful or handsome  like I don't know someone's attitude or kindness and yours stinks. It's not always, what's on the outside that matters. Have a blessed day and merry Christmas in advance, I wish you all the best in your life.",0.9887,140
"+M. Baysden Were you hired to come for anyone who trashes their performance? Like chill  it's not that big of a deal, the funny thing is neither Gwen nor Blake have a clue who you are, so quit defending people who have no idea of your existence.",0.4939,53

Daniel Peter Don't tell me what to do. I'll defend whomever I choose to defend..  & the one that needs to 'chill' is u as u clearly get so defensive when people come at u. Using the word  'lynching' is pretty defensive on your part Daniel..  so take your own advice & CHILL!!!,0.8206,64
Daniel Peter Like I said before..  I am not the one that said your pic was awful.  I couldn't care less if u look like a mutant or a male model out of GQ.

I never ignore Daniel when people trash Gwen & Blake..  ever!!!,-0.7357,86
Daniel Peter OMG  what an  awful picture profil HAHAHHA,-0.4588,9
Daniel Peter Read your original post asshat!!!  Your mama Daniel failed to teach u not to hate as that is clearly what u did.  Damn..  can u not see that???  Why is it that people have to come into vids posting their disdain instead of ignoring & moving on???  You think Gwen is awful & its the worse duet u ever heard..  when you make that type of post expect a reply & not a kind one as u do not deserve one.  Yes Daniel everyone is entitled to their opinion just like me & I definitely expressed mine. I am a HUGE fan of Gwen & u stepping on this vid to insult her & Blake's duet is like slapping us fans of these two in the face!!!  Do u get that Daniel???  Damn very immature & classy of you!!!,-0.619,164

melissa hahn You want to send me pics???  Truly disturbing & scary!!!  No Melissa I don't need pics as I already know how ugly you are.  I googled blowfishes & there you were.

I mean look at fat ass ugly Miranda but yet she still managed to make it in the country world.
