"Cancerous Asian that's what she thought because she was a crank. If that were the case, the owners of Cadillac would get haunted by people killed in drunk driving accidents and the CEOs of Big Tobacco would be swarmed.

Don't give up. The thing that you've been wrestling with is about to surrender your blessing this week. Breakthrough comes by pressing on and finishing the fight. Be like Jacob and don't let go until your opposition blesses you. In that blessing your identity will be changed forever. What you've been battling is not only going to bless you now but change your entire bloodline for generations to come thus says the Lord.,0.7003,79

"I heard about the actual house. The husband sold guns which were haunted by the people who were killed by them. The haunting has reached to herself, and to actually trick the ghosts, she builds a house with multiple rooms, and stairs often leading no where. She used the money from the sales of the guns. She has to keep building or she could die.",-0.9393,73

"Jacob Staten What an odd comparison. Cadillacs and Audis are not built to kill people, so why would the CEOs be haunted by dead drunk driving victims instead of the drunk drivers, who killed them because they were driving drunk? I don't see how the CEOs had any culpability. 

On the other hand, Mr. Winchester sold guns that would be used to kill people.",-0.9006,72
"John Doe it makes just as much sense. Blaming the manufacturer for something a buyer (or thief) does isn't valid. Remove the product and they will use something else.
Guns contain an explosion to project an object in a desired direction.
You can use it for entertainment (targets, reenacting, film, plays), communication, training, research, hunting, deterrent (of theft, assault, etc.), wounding, celebration (preferably with blanks). It's a product that gets used or misused by the customer.
What's more is that the weapons she was mostly worried about were during a war that she probably should have seen as helping the right side. Especially when you consider that most people at the time shot to miss. It doesn't matter if the product has the capability to kill because it doesn't have to be used for that. It's the person killing that deserves to be haunted, and that's assuming they killed someone who didn't deserve it (murder as opposed to justified).",-0.9822,193

"Of all cheap-scare horror movies, this one is the biggest eye-roll, and yes, I‚Äôm taking it personally. Friends, listen, I grew up and lived the first 29 years of my life just a mile away from the Winchester Mystery House‚Äî literally around the corner and down the street. This house ends up on a lot of ‚Äúthe most terrifying places in the world‚Äù, but it couldn‚Äôt be anything farther from. Sarah Winchester was just an eccentric old lady who believed that on-going construction to her unique West San Jose mansion would confuse spirits (killed by the rifles of her late husband‚Äôs company) from haunting her. Bizarre? Absolutely. Occupied by ghosts? Probably. Scary? No. The one thing I CAN appreciate is that they got the house structure accurate. I only just moved out of the Bay Area less than a year ago, but looking at the scenery shots here sure feels like I‚Äôm back home.",-0.7774,186

"That's the story fed to the public.  (Publicity.)  The truth is, although she *was* a grieving widow, her mind remained as sharp as a straight razor right up to her dying day.  She had a photographic memory, spoke several languages and had total recall of every item in her inventory of building-supplies and materials.  Also, one must remember that, in the 19th Century, Spiritualism was widely believed at the time, so her beliefs in this regard were not all that unusual for the time.",-0.0258,100

"Your opinion, as such, is irrelevant if it is contrary to established fact. It may be my opinion that you're a horse's ass, but that does not *necessarily* make it so (although there is at least some evidence to support my opinion.) ¬†And a belief that one is being punished by spirits isn't significantly all that different from a belief that one is being punished (or rewarded) by an all-powerful god, and yet billions of people believe that, in one form or another. ¬†By your logic, Doctor (just out of curiosity, from what University did you obtain your degree in psychology?), all of them must be ""sick in the head"" as well.",-0.7814,135
