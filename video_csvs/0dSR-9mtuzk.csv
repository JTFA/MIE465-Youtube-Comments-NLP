"Honestly, I think Kendrick is brilliant but I can't help but think that outfit is wildly inappropriate, I'm sure a lot of people would argue this but it's people like Kendrick the young girls look up to, she is an influential star, and when they realise they can't sing like her and act like her the next best thing is how she dresses and in a time of trying to enforce equality in men and women and stop sexism and sexual harassment, this is far from a move in the right direction. Keep up the great work but... come on... cover up.",0.9631,111

"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! Repent of your sins and put your Faith in JESUS!

Jesus LOVES you more than you think or even believe!
Please, if you do not know Jesus as YOUR Lord and Savior, call upon Him today. You will be saved! Hallelujah!

Jesus is NOT angry at you, He is waiting on you to call out to Him. He will hear and deliver you! 
The Lord Promises to NEVER drive anyone away when they come to Him, so friends, you have NOTHING to lose when you seek Jesus, but a lot to GAIN when you make Jesus your Lord and Savior! Hallelujah!

Judgement is quickly approaching, and Jesus is the ONLY WAY to escape since He took our punishment upon Himself on the cross.

The Lord died and rose again for US! Because He loves us that much! The question is, do we love God?
So Follow the Way He made for us to go Home - Follow Jesus!
To die without Jesus, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, is VERY dangerous since you die in your sin. But if you die with Jesus as Your Lord and Savior, you go home.Hallelujah!

Shalom, friends!",-0.5846,237
