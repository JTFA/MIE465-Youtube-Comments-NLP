"Oh, come on Guys, really? I watched him live delivering the unrehearsed house nigga joke to the Nebraska Rep. Senator Ben Sasse who'd invited him to the state 'to work a little in the fields'. It was spot on. Does it really not make a difference to You puritanical Americans if a nigga joke is being made by a well-known TV advocate for racial equality, especially on a kind of platform where it matters the most - politics and the legislature branch? Next episode had to be all about apologizing and listening to disgusted '100 niggas in one song' Ice Cube. Do You as a country, even consider giving Yourself a time deadline after which offending words now will become no more? Let's say in 100 years? Making racial offenders out of white leftist or liberal comedians is the stupidest thing Congress rednecks have always been counting on. You Pilgrims must have always been that way - fu*k morals: the end of racial segregation, thus we ban the n-word for whoever is white but let's come to America, give deliberately smallpox in gift blankets and let 95% of the natives die. I'm a white liberal from middle-eastern Europe, fan of both Maher and Amber (did You know the word slave derives from the word Slav which is a member of middle-eastern Europe ethnic groups also used to be one of the biggest source of slaves in Roman Empire? We basically mean slaves to this day - not bitching around, though) Below is the Maher-Sasse controversial part:

Maher - ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to get to Nebraska more.‚Äù
Sasse - ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome. We‚Äôd love to have you work in the fields with us.‚Äù
Maher - ‚ÄúWork in the fields? Senator, I‚Äôm a house nigga. [Following is to his audiance] No, it‚Äôs a joke.‚Äù",0.7295,356

"Plus, he went on this whole rant regarding the me-too movement and fictional romantic comedies.

I by no means hate Bill Maher. I just think that he thought way too hard and put way too much effort into comparing real-life actions and fictional entertainment. To me it's like saying if you like mystery books then you are a serial killer. It's just kind of silly and obviously not true.",-0.8827,133

"edgar santiago I think that was more than a couple mos ago, but none the less was not the right way to make a point in a political discussion, let alone for it to come out of his mouth period. And I do think that he has times where he's legitimately funny, I thought it was more before I got into his show for a while, then I realized that he's redundant and has his head up his ass. I mean he's not an idiot on certain points, but I can see him as someone who thinks raw water is healthier water, like kale is an amazing snack when you have the munchies. Raw water is unfiltered btw and you can actually get pretty sick from drinking it since not all of the bacteria and microorganisms that cause diphtheria and other life threatening waterborne diseases that shouldn't exist in the first world, but is now being sold for over $20 a bottle. Like a sports bottle size. It shows how in the dark he is and not ""woke,"" let alone someone who understands nor pays attention to people who do not enjoy white male privilege. He reads or hears about it and thinks it horrific, but probably won't do anything to actively do something if he saw non white men who he didn't know getting harassed, or racially discriminated against. He'd probably tweet about it later. Sorry it irks me how much he talks about getting rid of the right of people to abuse their power and getting rid of white privilege, but does nothing and lives in posh areas that are privileged and he never sees what happens in the world outside of his privilidged ass bubble. He's one of those people that make librals look like we're all mindless suburban potheads.  If you can't tell, lotta beef w bill mayher, though ice cube seemed just as racist when he confronted bill mayher. Like he thinks all white people are like bill mayher because they've all had the privilege to avoid seeing what it happens when you weren't born w white skin in person. He doesn't seem like a dick and he's an awesome dude, but what bothered me is that he wasn't just telling him ""you, that's fucked up, don't do that again, you can't white appropriate that word"" he talked to him like a racist white guy who's in the closet talks to black people. Really bothered me that he behaved exactly the same way white privileged people talk about the way the world works and how their right, despite not understanding what it is besides basic facts of what they agree and don't agree w, and frankly are acting superior to everyone in the room. When I've saw him being interviewed on Stephen Colbert after that happened, he behaved exactly the same way towards Colbert as he did mahyer, despite Colbert not crossing that line, let alone near it, and does whatever it takes to not force white appropriation down people's throats despite making fun of himself and what he has been born w as well of how bad white people are fucking things up. The interview was about the release of the 20th anniversary of his first album, I think straight out of Compton. I wasn't paying attention, I was bothered by his attitude just over discussing the album, like it wasn't worth his breath being there but had to, but who knows, I could've misinterpreted and that could just be how ice cube is. Both him and Bill mayher are people that I know id get irritated and probably have an argument about respect and manners w. Like their work though. Ice cube is hilarious. I like their movies, music (does bill mayher make music?), jokes, and respect the remarkable and culture changing things that they have done (once again, has bill mayher done anything that has changed the outlook and culture of the U.S. and changed us as a people enough because they open our eyes and minds to see the truth of the entire world around us? I'm just generalizing them despite the fact that it's obvious ice cube is more accomplished and has done more and Bill mayher is a comedian w a show on HBO). I respect them, I definitely respect ice cube more, though I have a feeling that the type if respect I have for him as a person and not just an artist, role model, or any of the other accomplishments that has made ice cube mother fucking ice cube. If he spoke to me like those 2, I would lose my ability to respect him as a human being. God. It's like I'm already feeling the attacks jusy dumping in me because of my view point on the whole incident. There was another black guy who told bill mayher that it wasn't cool, not to ever do that again and he's a fucking idiot in a more respectable and impacting manner. He didn't belittle bill mahyer, but he made himself look like a giant in the room and made Bill mayher look like a rodent while you could see he also made Bill mayher feel like one. Bill looked like he was looking for his dark sewer pipe to hide in after that. I've gone on 2 rants and I hope if you read it, you understand why I feel this way. Tv is not the best way to discipline a child for doing something extremely irritating, offensive, and just really fucking stupidity, especially when you're still raw, and annoyed and pissed.",0.9939,1024
