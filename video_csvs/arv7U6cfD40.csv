"I understand the conflict between wanting to organize your life, whilst also having access to props and costumes which enable your creations as an actress/director/youtuber.

Here's an advice: don't face it alone. The beauty of props is that most people in your line of work would need them. Why not associating/partnering up with other youtuber to have a comunal prop/equipment storage like the theater and movie studios do? Depending on how much money you have, as well as your group does, you'd be ab√±e to rent some space in orden to have such resources available to eveybody whom you trust enough to partner with and take proper care of your equipment. I think your type A personality would love it; organizing and labelling eberything in order to keep track of usage. Most people in your group might need spiky stuff, but not at the same time, yet agree that it is something worth storing just in case. It would require some logistic, and commitment from all parts, yet it would help a lot of people in your community that probably face the same issue you have.

This would cook two meals with one fire: you de-clutter your life and have access to props.",0.9511,230

"My biggest issue with her book is that it actually doesn't work in Japan. There aren't the 3 choices (keep, donate, throw) that there are in the US or UK. You can't donate things you dont want. You have to throw them away. I cannot in good conscience throw away books, clothes, electronics that still work that I just don't want. I can contact people on the Internet to give them the books but then I have to pay to get to the place to meet them to give them the book and then each time this costs me money. I don't necessarily mind this but if I'm spending ¬•500 for a train to and from meeting a stranger to give them a book it gets expensive. Waste in Japan is already a huge issue. Packaging is ridiculous. Usually it is recyclable but thats not the best practice, reduction is better. We can't get rid of all this plastic.",-0.8035,178
