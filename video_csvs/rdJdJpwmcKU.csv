And you were right this trailer shouldn't have launched until after Black Panther, but I never really thought BP would die. But now I know that chick won't die either. Finally I agree with the Vision thing. I really hope they add some depth to this movie by killing people. Ever since Vision has had that stone in his head I've seen it getting ripped out as the conclusion of his character. The only way I would be satisfied with his revival is if Scarlett Witch is involved (since she does it in the comics). But they should keep him out for a while at the minimum and definitely kill off one or two characters permanently(I love Paul Bettany and think he should be in more movies so that's why I'm okay with Vision coming back).",-0.3282,168

"The best thing Marvel could do is put Loki in the role of Mephisto from the Infinity Gauntlet comic books.  Mephisto was the voice in Thanos' ear about what the stones could actually do.  The Asgardians obviously know a lot about what the stones really are and Loki could be that devil on Thanos' shoulder.  Advising him because he ultimately wants to take the gauntlet for himself.  I just don't want them to turn Loki into an anti-hero, he's a bad guy and he needs to stay a bad guy.  I don't think they should use Hela as Mistress Death, that would put too much of the story into the Asgardian realm. It would be better to introduce Mistress Death and the cosmic entity that she is, but Ragnarok might have obligated them to use Heal in her place.  I don't think non comic book fans would be comfortable with skipping Hela for another ""goddess"" of death.  But definitely Loki should be Mephisto in the movie.",-0.4786,182
