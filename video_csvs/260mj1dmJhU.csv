"And how bad is he? 

Besides saying stupid shit and not knowing how to keep his twitter fingers at bay he‚Äôs actually doing fine tbh. I think people bash Trump‚Äôs actual presidency nowadays because they think it makes them look like they know politics. Or they‚Äôre so liberally blind they don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre being controlled by all the propaganda and biased networks (that benefited most from net neutrality but you won‚Äôt see that covered amongst all the republican hate) 

I‚Äôm getting $6,000 more back this year on my tax return where I was paying 40% as a middle class citizen. Sounds good to me. 

Perhaps people would like Obama back who backpedaled on FDA and food corporations because they threatened to pull donations. Or who hired the people who caused the economic collapse. 

The whole electoral process is a joke but I‚Äôd probably still be against Hillary. I think people need to start admitting Trump isn‚Äôt as bad as everyone thought he‚Äôd be.

Time to take the tinfoil hat off and stop the confirmation biased research about conspiracy theories of Russian collusion. Start looking at what he‚Äôs ACTUALLY doing. Unless, of course, you can‚Äôt see past the liberal conjecture painted as facts on every other conversation or documentary such as ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô.",-0.962,256
