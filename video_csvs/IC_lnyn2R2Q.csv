"""The 15:17 to Paris"" is Clint Eastwood's latest film...Is it any good, though? That's the question. Here's the answer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yS24klqm6I",0.504,28
"'Ordinary People' I like that. Our governments sure aren't doing enough to stop the Mohammedans Jihad against the kuffar. Remember they hate the kuffar. It will take ordinary people to stop this.

They call them terrorists but they ARE ordinary Muslims. The Quran states around 100 times to emulate Mohammed. Mohammed is the perfect example of a Muslim. Remember this. 

If you read the Sira you will see he was a vile, evil man. He owned, bought and sold slaves, raped slaves, had his meals cooked by slaves. Advocated slavery, dhimmitude. Mohammed said the kuffar should be lied to and deceived. Their religion tells them to lie to you. It's called Taqiyya - they have a word for it. Humiliate and torture the kuffur. Rob, steal from him - take his booty. Torture him.

There's no peace with Islam. No multiculturalism. And no golden rule. No do as you would be done by in Islam. Tell them this when they call you an Islamaphobe. Reveal their hypocrisy. Sharia - 1 law for the Mohammedan. 1 law for the kuffar. Kuffar are non citizens under Islam. Islam, the xenophobe civilisation. Religion of bigottry. 

They call our lands 'dar al harb' land of war. Perpetually war with the kuffur. No peace with Islam. They are all Mohammedans. This filth is their prophet. See how upset they get when you insult their prophet. The man was filth. It's all there in the Sira - Mohammeds biography. I've not exaggerated anything. I've told no lies. Do your own independent research. Bill Warner has great books on the subject of Islam. Imagine for a moment. A dystopian society where you couldn't, if you pardon my French, say for example 'Hitler was a cunt'. People are afraid to say this about false prophet Mohammed. You know this is not right, living in such fear. And it's completely backwards. Interesting fact: There's more hatred towards Jews in the trilogy (Sira, Hadith, Quran) than written down in Mein Kampf.

It's demonic. Take that literally or metaphorically. Islam is demonic. The enemy of free men. Don't be afraid. Speak truth. The emporer has no clothes. A chair is a chair.

Never forget 7/7.

And RIP Lee Rigby.

"It's sad this is getting reamed by biased ""critics"" with an ax to grind. Too bad it doesn't feature the appropriate narrative, like a certain ironically pro-ethnostate, pro-wall, pro-nationalism movie. Too bad it's directed by an undesirable. Too bad it portrays Christianity in a positive light. Too bad it portrays a real-life black hero that helped saved hundreds of lives; I guess he's not Woke-kanda enough. 

The movie was pretty good given the artistic direction Heston went with. No, the acting from the three leads isn't good. It's not supposed to be. They're not actors. Complaining about this is like complaining about an indie art house movie that's black and white and silent; that's the point of the movie, not a weakness. It's a very unique piece of art; instead of the heroes telling us their story, they show it to us. It's amazing how they acted out their lives up to that point, and re-lived that moment.

Yes but of course the true story of American soldiers kicking ass like in lone survivor? Ppl take 40 percent of this as how it happened and the rest a Hollywood myth just like lone survivor and every other movie that portrays American military as the bravest toughest most bad ass soldiers in the universe maybe beyond.,0.1432,59
