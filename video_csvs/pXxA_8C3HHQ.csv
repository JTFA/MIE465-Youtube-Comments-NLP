"There's a whole YouTube community of nomad RV'ers, Van Campers, and Skoolie owners (super cheap school district buses converted into very fancy/individualized RV's)

On YouTube Check out;

-Jax Austin
-Cheap RV Living
-Enigmatic Nomadics
-Into The Mystery13
-Chris & G travels

They're all full time nomad RV'ers. All are full time YouTubers for years, now. Living on the road happily. With their custom solar powared rigs (RV's Vans or Skoolies) with propane heating, and custom bathrooms and big screen T.V.'s. The works. They all help eachother out with free installs and conversions. Have a ton of videos on how to buy a super cheap 10-15 yo schoolbus (some long, some short) for under $2000. Then, convert them into a super luxurious custom made RV. For less than $15,000 total. Remember, school buses are 10 to 50 times more durable than any RV. Will typically last 3 times longer, or more. And, are upgradeable.

Don't be afraid to boondock your RV (not parking at a campsite). The only areas to keep cops from knocking on your window, and telling you it's illegal to sleep overnight in an RV are just the really wealthy coastal CA cities with a no overnight sleeping in any vehicle ordinance. Everywhere else you'll be fine. So, always Boondock whenever you can. 

This mobile boondocking youtube community just had two huge events of over 3000 rigs off I-10 on the border of SoCal & AZ. 

They help with filming/editing advice on the road. Help build eachothers channels through collabs/events. Get sponsors & brand deals. Help with Patreon & gofundme projects. The last event called the RTR (Rubber Tramp Rendezvous) was like a budding VidCon of nomad YouTubers in the Sonoran Desert. A really, really key YouTube community to know, party with, and depend upon. People at the RTR were just giving away giving solar panels, batteries, hitches, camera gear. Check them out!",0.9871,389
