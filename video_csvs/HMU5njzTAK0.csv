"i absolutely love the girl friday episodes, and i am sure you invest a lot of time in them. knowing that it's a bit of a pity that the sound quality really isn't that good, because i feel like that makes a huge difference in how the viewer looks at the video. maybe you don't notice it anymore, but to me it's quite prominent? but if you can't afford a new mic or whatever, don't stress about it, i still love and appreciate girl friday!! i think it would just be an easy thing to change that would make a huge difference in the end product.
love you lots xx
