"@Chess Expert
I find it fitting that the one comment that actually addressed the idea that I put out there, came from someone named ""Chess Expert"". 

That's why I love chess. You have to LISTEN to the arguments that your opponent is positing, and you have to objectively ADDRESS them. You can't just lazily sluff off some reckless, self-suiting and near-sighted, pseudo-response, and still expect to make it out of the opening...much less win.

 It's like chess is an exercise in ""truth-telling"". 

Unfortunately not a whole lot of chess players transfer the laws of the 'Sacred 64' into their life's philosophy.

In too many cases, the only part of their psyche/mind/consciousness/person that's worth more than bag of hammers, they leave at the board.

I watched the live chat for round 3 today, for about 10 minutes, looking for something redeeming...I won't make that mistake again.

Stupid people.

"Bring back Maurice, where chess can sound interesting to the passerby.
Maurices' delivery appeals to a whole new demograph of people.
Anyone that likes chess, played it years ago, and hears Maurice, will be 're-hooked'.
Anyone hearing more of the analytical droning, that only those of us that are already hooked can appreciate, will not be 're-hooked'.

Difference between Christian and Maurice: more shouting and more computer analysis. Sorry Maurice ;) just like the quiet commentary more ;),0.577,23
"Effective Instance You're right, being a chess commentator requires more than just knowledge of the game, it alway requires PERSONALITY. Maurice was the perfect fit to add color to the broadcasts and was very quick and efficient at relaying computer lines into real world concepts. A nice contrast with Yasser's deep knowledge of the game and anecotes of players. In my opinion this cristian guy absolutely sucks. I can't stand him to the point of having to either skip past the parts where he's talking or else stop the video all together. He's a boring young dolt with no personality and nausiatingly weak English.",0.5818,112

"Interesting question about what to study when in the 2000 - 2300 range.  I started to seriously study endings as a USCF class A (1800 - 2000) player, and I started with Rook and Pawn endings.  Why those particular endings?  They occur often and can be very tricky/subtle.  I drew many lost games and won many drawn games because I knew endings better than many of my opponents.  Yep, that would be my recommendation, too!",0.8313,86

"Jen and Yassir are flawless for their roles too, though. Both balance the technical theory with enough secular chit-chat; where, they don't just sit down and crunch lines for 4 hours, but they'll inject all kinds of information, commentary, and factoids, as well. I remember Jen on chessfm with Tony Rook, and she's become very good at announcing. Yassir is just a complete natural and always a pleasure to listen to. 

On top of being individually balanced, they balance one another as well; however, Maurice was the perfect addition to the trifector.

The only announcer/commentator that I've ever seen *DESCRIBE* the emotions and the feelings and the exhilarating tension that is involved in chess games, is Maurice. 

*EVERY* other commentator, based on their broadcasts, when weighed against the question of, ""Why should people try chess for the first time, or return to chess?"" has always answered it one way...

"" ... "" - everyone else.

""BECAUSE IT'S FRICKEN AMAZING!! YOU ARE MISSING OUT!! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT STILL PLAYING, OR HAVEN'T TRIED TO LEARN. GET A BOARD, GET A FRIEND, AND EVERYBODY PLAY SOME CHESS!! YA!!"" - Maurice Ashley

This brings me to the comment about the ""boring draw"".

Do you know what you're talking about when you say ""boring draw""?

Closed positions = INTERESTING
Open positions = INTERESTING
Semi-open positions = INTERESTING
Sharp positions = INTERESTING
Openings = INTERESTING
Middlegame = INTERESTING
Endgame = INTERESTING
The history between each player and the opening that's being played = INTERESTING
Prior games played by masters that went one way, where someone is trying a new way today = INTERESTING
Why a pawn on a3 should/shouldn't try for a4...and what that would accomplish and what that would detract = INTERESTING

This is why I make the point. For players under 2200 to look at a game and describe it as ""boring"", is most likely the case that they don't have a clue about chess, and still, likely, think of it as nothing more than ""advanced checkers"" instead of the INTERESTING debate/argument that it is.

Chances are that when we look at the chessboard, we see two entirely different things.
Chances are that this is why I'm in the top 95%, while you're somewhere underneath.",0.9988,449
