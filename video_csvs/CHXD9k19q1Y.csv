But because we don't know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.""",0.1054,170

What are you doing Friday?
Wanna help my worlds collide?
Let's make a bow with old cut ties
Do you want his number?
Or shall I be the one to call?
I haven't seen him much at all

It could be weird but I think I'm into it
You know I'm one for the overly passionate
I like you, and I loved him
We could all be the best kind of friends

You said you're into closure
Shake hands like you're supposed to
I'll be in the middle while you two get along
You've got so much in common
Talk about your taste in women
I'll be in the middle while you two get along

Hey!

Does he smile like I do?
Oh, it was shared despite our flaws
I held his hand like I hold yours
Thanks for understanding
Oh, this could be a lot of fun
So break the awkward, come undone

It could be weird but I think I'm into it
You know I'm one for the overly passionate
I like you, and I loved him
We could all be the best kind of friends
