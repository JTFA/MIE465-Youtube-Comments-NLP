"After a long illness, my mother died.  She was 83 and a diabetic.  Months later, around 1 a.m., I had severe pain in my side and took a cab to the same hospital she had stayed in.  I was overcome with emotion the moment the hospital came into view. I've been there several times since then and that feeling gradually passed. It was that first visit after her passing that tore me up, because I felt that the last time I was there she was dying and her death was still raw. Your advice to take care of yourself is one that I learned from my mom's illness and subsequent death.  Death can be difficult to think or talk about, but I think it's important to have the talk, because it will eventually happen to each of us, or someone we love or care about.

"As a ""ranger"" I had to wear a hat as a law enforcement officer, a firefighter and as an EMT.  I had a tough time at first with all these roles, although firefighting was a little easier as it was mostly wildland fire.  I got so wrapped up in the way people were feeling that I didn't get the job done very well.  I eventually had to learn how to detach myself from the situation just enough to get the job done, to be able to remember training and protocol.  I found that the constant recall of past incidents and allowing the emotions of everyone around the incident interfered with me getting the job done and actually helping people.  I was zealous about helping people, but I also realized that if I didn't detach myself a bit I could not help them.  I tried to learn as much as I could from every incident I was on.  I soon realized that without an appropriate level detachment I could not do my job well.  When the incident got to the point where I could change my focus to the friends/family I used as much empathy as was appropriate as every person is different.  Even when an incident resulted in a fatality, significant paralysis, loss of mobility, etc. if I did my job well, I felt good about the experience.  After all I could not control the circumstances or the decisions made by people so I had to let a lot of it go.  People often make some very poor decisions in the outdoors and you have to get used to it.  This may sound very unsympathetic and uncaring, but doing the job correctly is what ultimately helps people and I can't think of a more empathetic thing to do.",0.63,325

I don't normally comment, but I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am for your Channel, the way you openly talk about life as a doctor and also share experiences that may be hard and not what we see on TV, as in this video. I took my A-Levels/ graduated last year (I live in Germany) and want to go to med school since about 2.5 years. Currently I am studying for an exam to get into med school, which is really hard because there are so many people wanting to study medicine (I think it's similar in America(?)).

"I am a guy that was a respiratory therapist for some years and two incidents stick out. One was a female resident (1st or 2nd year) who had the unpleasant task of telling family members that their loved one died. There was a very unexpected response when one of the family members struck her in the face. Ouch! The other was with a new patient in the surgical/burn ward who had come in with burns, much of it on his face. I went in to draw an ABG on the  patient and was noticing that he was getting very antsy and also said that it was getting hard for him to swallow. I went to the resident at the front of the unit and spoke to him telling him that the patient needed to be intubated ASAP. He was right near the end of his phone call with the attending and the decision made by them was to hold off until he got there and they saw the patient in rounds. While I was still upstairs in our report session between shifts they called a code. It was him. If I remember correctly he did survive, but it still leaves me even to this day that I had been more assertive told the resident to call the attending back and talk to him again about the intubation, or contacted my supervisor or my department director. Good luck on your residency, and when possible, stay more than an arm's length from family members when you have to give the worst possible news.",-0.1759,282

I really enjoy every aspect of your channel.  I was a nursing assistant several years ago.

"I want to go to college for CNA training. I've had Community Emergency Response Training (CERT), tourniqute training, CPR training... For CERT, the hardest thing for me to learn was triaging.

For those who don't know, triaging is separating people into levels of injury- green is walking wounded or safe, yellow is delayed, red is immediate, black is dead.

I ended up taking CERT training twice, because with CERTs you are not a first responder in the sense of full training- with CERT response CPR, all you are able to do is tilt their chin back twice and open the airway, because if you engage in CPR you have to continue until the first responders come or the victim dies.

And that wastes time you need to use to save others.

This video was really great for me to stumble across before I really dive into the medical field.

P.S. 1) I've never had to act in CERT, and 2) We also have formal debriefings.",0.1263,193

After the worst passing me and a co worker were an absolute mess as we were close with the person and his family and just witnessing how horrible his death was was so awful. Our boss told us to act more professional and if we cry everytime someone dies we need to find a new profession.... i was taken back by that comment thats for sure. Its been a few years since then and its alittle easier now to deal with the passing of all our patients, but its so surreal.

"People who have a hard time comprehending death are the ones who are afraid of it. I’ve seen my fair share of death. Feeling “sad” about it comes from having empathy for the family that lost their loved one. As someone who believes that in God, death is just the next big adventure. If you’ve ever attended a memorial service where people are Christians, true Christians, you don’t see much sadness, because we know that our loved ones are no longer suffering and have gone to be with the Lord. 
I think the main thing people have a hard time accepting is that they are going to die, and encountering death makes that reality more apparent. It’s just not something most people think about on a daily basis. Accepting your own mortality. People seem to think when their diagnosed with an illness it means they’re going to die. You’re dying anyway. You start dying the day you’re born. I could die on my way to work tomorrow. I could fall asleep tonight and not wake up.

The same day i got my first kidney stone. Ended up having to have surgery for each, but had to wait till 2007 for the spine cause i was supporting a family. Because of my spine i lost a lot of muscle and gained a bit of fat. I did what i could but was never the same. Kept getting more stones (uric acid stones, nothing has made my body stop making them) over the years. Also ended up with bad neuropathy in my feet from the spine surgery. The spine surgery (L5/S1 fusion) did not help, have been in perpetual pain since.

Fast forward to Sept of 2016, by this point i have had over 400 kidney stones and weight fluctuated between 190 and 240 (at 5'10""). 6 days before my 35th birthday i started feeling an ache in my chest and in my left arm, within 5 minutes i was in agonizing pain on the floor, trying to call 911. Ended up that i had a 95% blockage in my LAD (Left Anterior Descending artery in my heart. Also known as the widowmaker). At the time i did not have insurance and medicaid was giving me the run around.

Because i had no insurance i could not afford all the medications they wanted me on, especially the Plavix and baby aspirin. The stent they put in clogged 2 months after first heart attack, i was having my second. Same deal. Another stent, 2 months later i had my third heart attack. Same deal. Now these three were Non-STEMI, i dont remember exactly what the acronym means but basically they are treated with nitro, sometimes they stop, but the nitro atleast keeps you going till a spot opens in the surgery room so they can put a stent in.

Fast forward 3 months, on the floor again, this time its a STEMI. This is the nitro barely works, ambulance uses lights and sirens, straight into surgery type. My heart stopped. They were able to get it going with the super expensive, ultra high tech Cardiac Thump (they punched me in the chest). In goes stent number 3, for those keeping track that was heart attack number 4.

Fast forward another 3 months (can anyone guess what happens?) hit the floor again. Another STEMI. Same deal, rushed in, died on the table. This time i was down for 5 mins 24 seconds. Took a whole lot of shocking to get it going again. Not like you see on TV kids, when i came to a moment later i felt like i had a machete sticking out of my chest, paddles left burns on my chest. Then something magical happens, my social worker decides to do his job ...i know, i know, i can hear the gasps from here. I dont know which is the bigger miracle, surviving 5 heart attacks in less than a year, or a medicaid employee doing work.

Finally get insurance and get the meds, have been heart attack free ever since (its like saying i have been mice free!). Been doing what i can health wise but my heart took a beating, if i get my rate up much i get bad chest aches. Had an angiogram a month ago just to check up on things, scar tissue is in good shape, obviously permanent thinning of the artery. My left arm has permanent damage after being deprived of blood for so long, was purple by the time they got me on the table with the last one.

Now here it is, i just got diagnosed a diabetic a few weeks ago and had a CT done, they saw spots on my colon, so now i have to deal with that.

All this while trying to take care of a very disabled mother and so poor, living off one meal every day to every other day. Barely get enough food stamps between us to get good diabetic friendly food for her, hers is so bad she is on the verge of losing her feet, was in the hospital with sepsis, etc.

I have to see mental health jusy to try and keep my sanity, i have no pain control because doctors think everyone is a drug addict now (thanks ever so much pill abusers), so whenever i am not taking care of mom or the house i am rolling around in bed in pain, like now. Not easy typing all this out on a cell phone while rolling around. Atleast my ex is nice enough to pay for this thing for me (Note: her plan came with the 3rd phone for free).",-0.9881,948

"Thank you for sharing. I am currently a 5th year Medical Student in Spain, and for a while now I've been struggling with finding/seeing a lot of disconnection between doctors and the real-ness (that you talked about in the video) of the reality of their work and their patient's lives. This sometimes lead me to think that as a very empathetic person, I wouldn't be strong enough to give the best opprtunities/care to my patients and their famílies; that being empathetic was what somehow lead doctors to disconnect from their emotions and their patient's emotions -as a way of finding balance between their work and personal life-. But today your words have given me hope. The reality, the raw human-ness(I am making up words) of the practice of medicine is what lead me and has kept me in Medical school, so today I am very grateful for finding your words, thank you for sharing your struggle and thoughts on such an important matter. I needed it.",0.9642,189
"Thank you for this video. I am a doctor too and during my short experience i've had to deal with very strong moments.

"This is something that I’ve always wondered. Do you think hospital staff, at the very least those who witness a patients passing, become desensitized to death? Like after a certain amount of time you don’t get affected by it and it just becomes part of the job.",-0.2263,56
"This may sound odd, but I think Doctors need to focus LESS on keeping patients alive.  

My mother had cancer and it became clear that not only would further treatment not extend her life, treatment was eroding the quality of the life she had left.  

She refused further care AMA and died shortly after, receiving only palliative care.  

A patient is not a test where you must demonstrate the breath and depth of your medical knowledge, with death being a failing grade.  

Sometimes the best choice a physician can offer a patient is the choice to die as painlessly.",-0.86,108
"This popped up in my recommendations and the title looked interesting. I used to be a nurse assistant, so I saw my fair share of death back then. Fortunately, most of those people were at the end of life stage. However, it was difficult at first even with them being old.

"You mentioned that you attented a debriefing ""what went right and what went wrong"".  That sounds like a technical debriefing.  A friend of mine in law enforcement said that they have Peer Support (for  work related trauma,  divorce, family illness, substance abuse, etc). They attend a 40 hour class and quarterly training focused on mental health (learning how to ""listen"" and techniques on creating a dialogue  which helps the person to process the trauma) of the employees.  The Peer (on all shifts) responds to attends to the emotional needs of the employee involved in a traumatic event.  They will stay in touch with the person and refer to free professional help (a list of vetted effective professionals and treament facilities) if needed. The initial goal of the program was to reduce suicides.  It worked.",0.8779,158
