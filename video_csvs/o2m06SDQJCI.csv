I am an older, mature woman, and I'm in awe of his bravery to do these procedures. I didn't have any self confidence until I was in my 30's, so it's a great thing to see, and we couldn't see if he didn't agree to have it filmed, and you didn't share, so thank you both!",0.9705,81

"Dr pimple popper I can't say enough spectacular words about you, your staff, your patients, your family including your two cats and your fans. I'm an animal lover and named our cat lucky because mom took off after delivering two babies. I went to the humane society and one didn't make it. They said with lucky if she could take a bottle I could keep her alive and she took the bottle. She also has double paws in the front so it was like these lil hands holding the bottle. We named her lucky because she is literally lucky to be alive. Feedings got rough when she starting growing teeth. So I tricked her by pulling the bottle out of her mouth put a lil moist cat food in and then put the bottle back in her mouth real quick. In about a week of doing the trick thing she started eating the moist food on her own. I had to do a trick thing in getting her to go potty in her box. I started with newspaper but when I changed it to litter she got confused and had two pee accidents and then she started using the litter box. There's more to that story but I wanted to share this with you because you have two beautiful cats. I can see the young one is hip attached to you and the white one is like what the heck she's my mommie.(sorry I don't know how to spell their names Takita and Demsel?). And back to the original story all your patients are beautiful and brave. I am so thankful that you share your videos. I have a history of cysts and acne. I've had them in more private areas and thought I was the only one so you're patient helped me to know I wasn't the only one to get cysts in these type of areas on the body. I think shaving has caused some. They are also genetic or hereditary because I have family members that have them. I live on the east coast so I don't have the option to see you. Please let your patient know with Calcinosis Cutis that he has helped probably a lot of people who get them in difficult areas. I love your videos, staff, patients, family, friends and fans. Everyone of you are beautiful and brave. It's so relaxing because I am not alone and it is like a bedtime story for me. I watch it more than just bedtime but enjoy watching it the most before I go to sleep at night.",0.9975,470
"Dr, I know this is unrelated to the video but your cheekbone structure is so nice.",0.7118,18
Dr. Lee correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but the stuff in the nodules is calcium? I also read that women can get these as well. That you can actually get different forms of this all over your body and that it‚Äôs calcium buildup under the skin. The one report I read says that the scrotum one is uncommon and most men get them removed for cosmetic reasons. I love learning new stuff and my mom is a retired CRN RN. Thanks for sharing!,0.9455,94

This young man is very brave. You are providing the safe, caring environment for that bravery. Thank goodness for you. You obviously do procedures that other doctors don‚Äôt do.

"Whether or not the patient said it was ok, that‚Äôs fine and I do not believe the Dr. did anything to embarrass him or to shame him, she‚Äôs not about that and she does help patients and I really love her videos. However, I do not think this is appropriate to show, it‚Äôs a private matter. The Dr. could have discussed it on video, what the patient has wrong with him, showed the picture of what it is (symptoms and what it looks like), and left it like that. There was no need to show him holding his private part, then showing the procedure of you giving him a needle and then extracting what was inside. Actually, if a young man had this problem and he saw this on a video, he would probably be very upset, and think to himself,  this is way to painful to watch (from a male‚Äôs prospective) and never discuss it with anyone. And, we all know that this video can get into the wrong hands, a parent can be watching this video and put down there phone or I pad, not close the screen and a young person can see and it would be devastating for this to get into the wrong hands. Just use your best judgment on serious matters like this. Again, of course, you can talk about the patient on video, show his or her condition and let people know there‚Äôs help out there that can make it clear up with the right doctor and right treatment. I didn‚Äôt mean to put you down, I enjoy everything you do and I know you care very much about your patients. It‚Äôs just my opinion, doesn‚Äôt make what I right. I‚Äôm just saying how I feel.
