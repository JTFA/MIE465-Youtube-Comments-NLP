 Im a huge fan of your videos, and I have an idea for you because I trust in your word and I like how you dig into things. Lately I have seen so many advertisments about this Mous case, yeah I know you don't do that kinda reviews but this product in particular is promising something I thought would never come anytime soon and I know you like to deny promising advertisement so.... I thought you might read me! Sorry if my English is incorrect, I'm from Mexico!
P.S. 
Every review I found about that case is sponsored by the company itself, so... I had a hard time believing it, and I completely trust you, so I hope you read me!

"Just wondering why when you first turned on the autopilot and it went around a curve and you were laughing about how cool it was, why you didn't film it or at least film it going around a bend on its own again? Also after charging and restarting the car why you didn't film yourself leaving and trying to turn the autopilot back on. Thes were both interesting visions for the viewer but instead, you just talked about them. This is a video, you should show them. Also good info for everyone: The Tesla currntly has level 2 autonomy which is good but the new Renault is going to have level 4 Autonomy which is light years ahead of what is already an awesome system. I think it's out of 5 levels. Level 5 being the car eats humans and spits them out and joins the collective. I guess.",0.9607,161
