"I always come to this whenever I feel down which is sort of becoming more and more often. I’m currently at a really bad place. I have hearing issues that make me feel isolated from everyone. This in return makes me purposely isolate myself from my friends and family since I can’t keep up with their conversations. I sort of have been getting a really spotty attendance record at school and have started slacking off on my work. I think the worst part is that teachers don’t even try to understand or empathize with my situation and because of this, i have begun to lie to myself and tell myself that i am ok when im not. I always try to have a bright smile and be the sweet and kind girl that everyone sees me as but its been getting harder and harder each day. I just can’t find the energy in me anymore to smile or even talk for that matter. I just am someone that’s getting more and more lost. I don’t want to burden people with my problems which explains why I’m constantly expressing my anxiety on the internet. I just need an outlet",-0.584,223

"I need a question answered if anyone can help. When I was a university at 23, there was this 16 girl from the college part of the university that was upset once, and I helped her out and she was really grateful. Only problem is... it’s now been 2 years, and she’s just so emotionally draining, she messages me all the time with quite frankly really minor issues that I wish she’d sort out herself. It’s not that I don’t know how to help her, but it’s so emotionally draining to keep trying to hold her up all the time. I’ve had so many issues myself with eating disorders and bipolar disorder, and I just get so frustrated when she bombards me with these petty problems like, “I have an hour journey home on the train” and she just demands constant reassurance. What can I say or do to make it stop? I need to concentrate on my own well being before I crash and burn.",-0.87,197

"So there's a few things that I try to do to prevent the things around me and the emotions within me from getting in the way of me living my life. Definitely getting enough sleep and eating healthy is the #1 best thing to have a stable mood. But on top of that, not suppressing your emotions and instead channeling whatever you're feeling into a creation of your own of some sort is the best way to more forward from a feeling. For me using a feeling as an inspiration to channel it into a unique creation is the best way to move onto the next step of what fate brings my way, whether its a negative emotion or a positive one (and surprisingly negative emotions turn into the most beautiful creations when you convert them). And the last thing is being honest about what you're missing in your life and doing your best to try and fill that. There are certain things that people people don't realize are absolutely necessary and crucial to having your day going right. For example, people especially in the US (myself very much included unfortunately) suffer from loneliness, lack of physical affection, and deep meaningful relationships (regular, sexual, and otherwise), and studies show that this is almost as important as breathing to function properly. So definitely do your introspection to see what you're missing and then do your research to see how much it actually affects you then do your best to make the changes that will bring you what you want and deserve. Ultimately the thing that makes me the happiest is creating something, whether its recording music, writing down jokes or ideas. Keep your river of energy flowing as often as you can, the worst thing you can do is let it stagnate. You'll know if what you're doing is what you really enjoy when time just flies by and you're in this incredible focus state where things just flow effortlessly, almost from a place beyond yourself.",0.9951,365
"Sure it's okay to be okay and life is supposed to be fun a lot of us have anxiety and depression and have no idea it's an early sign of chronic illness. Be you, be free, be unhappy! or happy. whatever floats your boat",0.5562,49
