"Im in the HVAC industry and work on boiler systems daily.. Youre right if it where a steam system but 99% of boiler systems in residential applications are not steam boilers, they are simple hot water boilers and hot water runs through the rads, not steam. In this case banging usually indicates a serious issue with either the systems pumps or the boiler itself. Usually these sounds are caused by the boiler over heating (because the pump is not circulating the water) this generates a flash steam bubble that usually over pressurizes the system breifly. This pressure spike blows out the pressure relief and the system auto fill valve quickly fills the system back up to operating pressure. When the boiler fills up quickly you get water hammer, (same if you slam a water tap shut quickly in an older home with no expamsion tank) and the water hammer is the cause to the noise. Other times just the steam bubble rising to the top of the system can cause the water to hammer through the pipes too. But if you're getting banging from your rads, and if there is water all over your boiler room floor, you should get is serviced before it kills you in your sleep.",-0.9294,227

And mind you, I've never seen actual saturated steam coming out of that valve, just air. I know water vapour is invisible, but the fluid in a radiator really isn't anywhere close 100 Â°C, so there would only be saturated steam visible. But it is just air.

We let out the build-up steam in the radiators so the water can fill up the place so the heat is better transfered.
Heating with steam nowadays is used in heavy industry (or in big buildings where the steam is transfered to higher levels where then the heat from the steam is transfered to water via heat exchangers and from those goes the heated water into the radiators) in which the steam can reach above 400 Â°C but it needs high pressure ( in MegaPascals ), in which state the steam has a very high heat capacitancy.
