"I do not agree that books belong to their readers more than their author. I think all art interpretation is a mixing of creator's intent and your own experiences, and that interpretation can feel very personal to you, but that doesn't mean that piece of art belongs to you. An author is the only one who truly understands their characters inside and out, and they nearly always know more than what ends up in the book. As to whether or not the author considers things that are not in the book(s) as canon depends on the author. But I think we should respect it if they do. (Full disclosure, I'm writing an extremely personal series that I am somewhat terrified to continue publishing because it is so very personal and mine.)

"John, Turtles All the Way Down, specifically Aza's life, resonated with me on a fundamental level that I had never previously experienced. While I knew other people suffered from the same illnesses I do, I couldn't help but feel isolated and trapped with no way of verbally expressing my struggles adequately. While my triggers are different than Aza's, reading TATWD felt less like I was reading a fictitious story about someone else's life but rather looking through a window into my own. I felt almost euphoric, as though I had found the missing piece to the puzzle that is my life. Finally! I had a way to truly and accurately convey what my day to day life is like.

"My current comment might apply directly or indirectly but anyway I would like to tell my opinion when it comes to books and why I love movies of books as it might not be intuitive.

First I must say I am not a big reader, in fact most of what I read is technical/educational stuff. Given this fact, a movie can make me enjoy a view of a book that I might/probably will not read. Also one of the reason I don't read other kind of books has to do with imagination. Although I can imagine weird and complex 3D objects (with interactions between objects) in my head or complex software structures, I have a near inexistent ability to picture a scene or a character in my head. I am quite of the ""engineering"" kind. Added to this, I have near inexistent ability to follow discussions/interactions if I cannot visualize the characters implicated. If I cannot follow the story, you must guess that I have a hard time enjoying it! Now I must admit all of this may have to do with the fact that I don't read a lot of books. Lets not get in a loop here!

One of the books I enjoyed the most is Dune that I read while traveling to/from university. When I was younger I watched the 1984 movie a lot of times, something around 25+ times. You must guess I have a clear picture of Paul and every other character in my head at any time. With this, I was able to follow the book like a train on rails! The book added so much to the movie it made it totally enjoyable.

May be for some persons a movie is something ""less"" than a book but for someone like me, a movie can be near a prerequisite for a book!

Anyway, thank you for allowing the movies of you books to exist, it is greatly appreciated!",0.9949,366

"When my friends and I found out our favorite John Green book was going to be made into a movie we were all heartbroken. We don‚Äôt want this book to be a movie. We don‚Äôt trust that it will transfer well to the screen and we fear for how OCD will be represented. If this book belongs to its reader, please don‚Äôt do this. TFIOS made a great movie but Paper Towns wasn‚Äôt done right and I can‚Äôt bear the thought of this story, which feels like someone wrote it from my own head, won‚Äôt be done well on screen.",0.882,120

"Woohoo! Go TATWD movie! 

While reading, I again marveled at your ability to articulate what common knowledge says cannot be articulated. I think once more you have given a voice to the otherwise silent sufferers. 

Now I am equally excited to see how it's brought to the visual medium. If any team can...

"You have no idea how badly I want this to be a movie! The whole time I was reading it I was just like, I can't wait till the movie comes out so I can see another version of it. I find it interesting how other people can perceive the same book differently.",0.126,57

You should totally cast Nat Wolff - even if you just cast him as an extra - because he was in both in tfios and paper towns and you kind of have to keep the streak going. I know this would also be slightly weird since while watching the film you would maybe imagine the other characters but if he could play both Isaac and Quentin without everyone getting confused it means you should think about it.,0.653,79

i have not read the book yet but i think u should cast new actors by that i mean  (there are amaizingly talented people out there ) plus its exciting when you see new actors in big films rather than the same actors in every movie,0.8674,47

"is it odd that as an avid and long term vlogbrothers fan, I love both the brothers and yet don't like Johns writing or Hanks music?   I don't think they're 'bad', just.. not my thing.  Yet I love their ideas, the way they talk, all their crash course/sci show stuff, and hearing about their lives...

*EDIT: I should clarify, it's not that I don't like johns 'writing' , I just don't find the books to be my cuppatea.",0.6888,97

"omgomgomggggg ok  Nat wolff, cara, shailene and ansel should definetly be a part of it! Maybe not like a really big part but all were asking is that they play extras or something so they become those extras that are in a couple scenes and then once in a while they just look at the camera like heyyyy i know ur there haha it just wouldnt be the same wothout them!!!!!!!!",0.7682,77

"you know this might sound self-centered, but I've always wanted to be an actor so maybe an opportunity to audition and everything would be cool so ya know first time big movie wowowow but yeah that would be cool to play aza or daisy, but actor wise i would say amandla stenburg and rowan blanchard something like that i suggest new teen diverse actors so yeah okay bye or yara shahidi!!!!",0.9835,76
