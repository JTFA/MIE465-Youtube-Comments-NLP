Like you, I've been noticing my ad revenue has been very poor on my channel. With over 500,000 views per month, it's getting very irritating to have revenue almost cut in half. I suspect it's got something to do with the most recent ""limited or no adds"" fiasco. I really wish YouTube would get it's head out of it's butt and fix their stupid ""limited or no ads"" bot, which flags about 20-30% of my totally benign videos about RC aircraft.
