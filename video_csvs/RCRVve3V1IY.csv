"Anni Burgoyne dude do a bit of research and see how many dogs we know of die from hypothermia. Just take a second to educate yourself please. Dog have a higher body temp then humans do, this is harder to maintain in colder weather. What do you mean they have different ways to keep warm? I mean all mammals use basicly the same methods to warm up with blood vessels constriction, fat build ups and muscle spasms. Also man didn't always have modern housing or fire so by your logic we should be more able to suffer the cold then dogs since modern dogs are not a creation of nature. We made them man",-0.7768,122
Anni Burgoyne if you have wolves thwn yeah they should be out all the time but dont expect to keep anything alive near by. My sister had some at one point (thats a long story). They are well equipped for it and killed all her chickens and a few cows over the years. They are used to being outside because they are natural. Dog were no made and conditioned by nature to survive if man didn't exist tomorrow dogs would eventually die out. There are wild packs of dogs (usually strays) but eventually those packs die out. If you own a dog you really should learn about them and stop being lazy and accept you took on a responsibility.,-0.9382,130

She comes in during the day to play, but soon goes right back outside. Yet, in the summer she always wants to be inside in the tile, while I'd be comfortable in the 80 degree sun.

The dog went from staying alone in his workshop, to the back door area inside, to inside the house.....
Unfortunately, that process didn't move as quickly as I hoped:(
My father did come to love the dog over the 13 years of it's life and wept when it had to be put down due to massive cancer.

"I don't have a dog.I have a cat,his name is Jake.I used to let him stay outside for a while as I supervise him.But when it becomes really cold I wouldn't let him out.I know its not the same as keeping him out all day but I could never!I live in a apartment complex and mine just happens to be right by the road, there's other cats and he's quite territorial especially when it comes to other toms and will attack them,there's geese wich he attempts to attack but I fear the will get injured,he'll just start meowing and scratching the door because he doesn't feel safe when im. Not supervising him so he wants to go back inside, HE SCARED OF PEOPLE (He wont go outside unless there's nobody out),ANNNNDDD he's my child!! I would never leave my baby outside all day and night!! 
But like I said I live in an apartment complex and there are OTHER cats.Most of those cats are pets of the people who also live in my complex.Although some people like my friend keeps her kitties inside ALMOST EVERYONE WHO HAS A CAT LEAVES THEM OUTSIDE! Not like a day thing like outside for an entire MONTH! Usally they end up crawling into the woods.Sometimes even a whole YEAR cats are out DAY/NIGHT BURNING/FREEZING not even being fed!! And there's even more cats suffering because the flipping owners don't spade and neutor their cats! So we have kittens running all about and when they grow up they have kittens!! One time it was a thunder storm and I saw a little kitten climb into the TRASH CAN FOR SHELTER! Poor thing it was pouring out and thundering! So I had to sneak out into the rain to give the kitten some of my cats food rapped in a paper towel.When the rain and thunder stopped the little thing climbed out,ate the food,and ran off into the woods.Its vary sad how these people cant even take care of there pets.Sometimes kind people would even feed someone elses cat because they were practically starving.Some cats were left in the hot summer sun and drank from dirty puddles that were left after a rain shower.Some cats had to seek shelter under people's bike covers.It is so hard and sad to watch.. You might say call the animal shelter.Well.. many people have and the owners just covered it up and got away with it.People don't even bother now because they know the owner is just going to make up some lie to keep their cat.why though? I mean its not like you even taking care of it.Might as well give it to someone else who will actually provide food,shelter,and affection towards it.

I cry so hard for these precious Souls. Please fight for stricter laws!  It is the only way this is going to change. A man that I worked for does not allow his dog in the house. And it has been -40c every day for the last month with extreme high winds from the North. He does not feed the dog because he wants it to hunt for his own food. I told him that his dog will get sick,cold or could freeze to death and he answered me by saying...it’s just a dog. I called the Humane Society on him and they said they could do nothing...This is the answer that I get all of the time. This is so very very sad.
However, I have called the police and a few times the dog was surrendered by the family!  My dogs are my children. I would never leave them alone. They sleep with me and go with me almost everywhere I go. I love them much more than myself and I even cook for them on a daily basis!  This is just so cruel and is heartbreaking and must stop.

But these dogs are also highly defensive of their family and love their family very much

"Nick Oathout They survive, but their lives aren't all magic purple butterflies and friendly pixies.

Living in the wild sucks, no matter who or what you are. So, you've survived a day in shitty weather? Now you're weak, and a stronger predator is eating your intestines while you gasp... you can't get away, and even if you could you'll still die. The shittier part is, that predator isn't going to live long either.

Evolution only works by reproduction. If you live long enough to fuck and have offspring, that's good e-fucking-nough. In fact, a lot of animals evolved to use the ""fuck and die"" tactic! 

Wild animals have short, pitiful lives.

But for some fucking reason, we made an animal that is not even adapted for the wild to live long enough to reproduce in the wild, and then say stupid shit like ""well, the wild ones survive!""",-0.9897,175

They did nothing when they first arrived. After an hour passed the owner took him in until the pound left. The dog died a month later.

"Our dogs are outdoor dogs. They stay outside no matter how cold/hot. They each have a separate dog house under our porch out of the wind with around 2 inches of cedar chips in the bottom. They have each other, but have two dog houses because they both can’t fit in one. They are both large dogs with thick coats. Not only do they have the dog houses, but they have a heated and cooled shop with another dog house big enough for both of them in it. Again a HEATED shop with a dog house with two inches of cedar chips. Completely out of the wind. The temperature in there without heat is about 20 degrees warmer. By all means if you see a dog chained to a tree with an empty dog house I can see being upset. They both do perfectly fine, get fresh water hourly. The dog only suffers if the owners don’t care for it. Also, the vet had no cedar chips or Insulation in the dog house. He had blankets which don’t do much good if you can’t bury in them. I don’t agree with having large dogs inside. Indoor dogs barely ever spend hours outside which is what they need. Dogs need raw AND fresh meat, not grocery store meat, and large dogs should be outside providing they have the right conditions",0.9598,263
