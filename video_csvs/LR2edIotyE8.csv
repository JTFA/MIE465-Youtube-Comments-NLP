It wasn't for Beyonce to check this actress. Jay Z was supposed to tell the actress to back up.

"M J Exactly! whether i knew my man cheated or not i will still check a woman for touching him or i will walk over there with an attitude and stand at his side to let u know im his, not that im insecure just EVERYBODY not to be trusted at all. as u said women are scandalous and could be worse as men. i mean for us women.. How would our man feel if hes across the room and happened to look over and see a guy hand on our shoulder, or hes holding our hand for to long after a  handshake etc? my first instance if im having a good conversation i wouldn't think hes flirting with me.. But from my man's view he would think the man is trying to flirt with me.. Sometimes we can see things different and maybe have a quick reaction or unnecessary reaction but in that case it wasn't unecessary. if bey was so insecure than why did she let tiffany have a convo with him without walking over there?  etc.. 

Sorry for the long post.. but some people are quick to judge until they're facing the situation.

What would you do just watch and not say nothing? or would you walk up to see what this convo is about? dont act as if you wouldnt feel some kind of way. sometimes its not our men out here thats doing dirt sometimes its the women you cant trust as well. i mean in todays world sometimes you have to watch out doesnt mean youre insecure or jealous.
