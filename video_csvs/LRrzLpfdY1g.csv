"Jewel Blue So awesome that you Love Jesus Christ Our LORD as do I and yes it so important to tell whomever will listen as the Holy Spirit leads us. I watch Joseph Prince as he teaches thee ""Gospel of Grace"" and consistently points to Jesus. I have listened to many of them preach/teach over the years and the Holy Spirit showed me it was causing confusion. God is so Gracious he gives me revelations through Pastor Prince's teachings and that has given me the Peace of God that was hard to see through some of the messages mixed with law. I appreciate you telling me about that channel though. I'll check it out. Stay strong in the Faith and rest in Christ!!😊",0.9895,136

"Luke's Gospel 1:46-55My soul doth magnify the Lord,And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour,Because He hath regarded the humility of His handmaid:for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed;Because He that is mighty, has done great things to me; and Holy is His Name.And His mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear Him.He has shewed might in His Arm: He has scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.He has cast down the mighty from their seat, and has exalted the humble.He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent empty away.He has received Israel, His servant, mindful of His mercy.As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed, for ever.",0.9517,148

Mary did you know that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?

This child that you've delivered, will soon deliver you

Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby, you have kissed the face of God

Mary did you know, Mary did you know, Mary did you know

The blind will see, the deaf will hear and the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the lamb

Mary did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know that your baby boy will one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding is the great I am
