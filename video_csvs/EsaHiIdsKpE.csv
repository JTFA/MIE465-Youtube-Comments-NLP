America's Real Civil Rights History
By¬†The American Civil Rights Union

¬†Democrats claim that they have always supported equal rights for black Americans and that Republicans are racists who always oppose them.Both claims are flat-out lies. From its¬†founding in 1854, the Republican Party led the fight to end slavery and then eradicate the racist Jim Crow system that held blacks down right up to securing the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Democrats opposed the Republicans at every turn.The spectacularly untruthful statement below was featured on Democrats.org until 2009. This actual screenshot is, to our knowledge, the only one in existence.
