"did you know that by heating honey over 60 C 
1. removes the flavors almost completely and makes it into a flat, overly sweet substance
2. depending on the type of the nectar it may accumulate biologically active toxins that may cause inflammation and even cancer of digestive system epithelium
3. you simply denaturate all the antioxidant molecules that were in the honey making it completely useless, better add anything sweet (Molasses for the crispy, caramel coating) for the same effect",0.5244,89
