No moving parts, only the marbles moves, magnets sits still and the marbles become demagnetized. Could save space on the machine. Maybe someone wants to make a response video and conduct that experiment? If so, please post your videos in the replies to this comment for everyone and me to enjoy! Otherwise, I Will make some tests of this method and update you here in some day. Would miss another spinning wheel though...

Also did you know that when you get funky colors on a CRT screen you can slowly spin a magnet in front of it while slowly pulling away to fix the colors? It's called degassing, and some CRTs don't have an electronic circuit to demagnetize the shadow mask that is supposed to direct the beam, so you have to do it with either a magnet or an overpriced loop of wire that is connected to mains. Don't try connecting a loop of wire to mains though. You will probably die.",-0.7964,115
"When you rotate a magnet you are in essence making electricity through an etheric field a full 360 rotation of a ""magnet"" create both a magnetic and dielectric field when these two energy fields cross they produce electricity. The centrapedal force and centrifugal forces is what is referred to as magnetism and what induces ""polarity"" however neather side is positive or negative in essence the repulsion is caused by the clockwise and counterclockwise energy paths of the energy field when you place say two ""N polarity"" and face them together  you are causing the molecules to be forced against each other almost like two marbles going towards each other on a track and bouncing away, where the opposite position is like two marbles on a two lane track moving past another. Another example that is more close to the movement of magnet particles is two springs rotating the same direction will always compress against each other causing repulsion but if they are rotating in apposite directions will mesh and move into another like a corkscrew. When something becomes magnetized it's acting like a battery holding a dielectric charge and producing an energy field until it's opposing energy being electricity neutralizes the force. You can see Dielectricity or a natural magnet as a highly negative charge and Electromagnetic as a highly positive charge.",0.9467,234

For more consistency, increase the width of these holes to 1.9 diameters of a single marble, and in the last 0.4 diameters you add a small layer of wood at the sides as a wall to prevent the marbles from falling back out sideways (due to the movement of the wheel, the marbles are forced into these these ""pockets"" and wont move sideways anymore).

This way the marbles will get into these pockets faster since the entrances are wider, but staying below 2 diameters of a single marble for these entrances makes it so that you can only have 1 marble inside any of these pockets at a time, preventing jams.",0.0019,168
