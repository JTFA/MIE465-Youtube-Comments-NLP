"John Oliver probably doesn't outright lie, but his viewpoints are usually very one sided, which make them just as dangerous. His joke about Germany maintains a way of thinking that may have been alright in the past but not anymore, Germany has been a shining light for many years now, more so than the UK and USA, I'm really not going to judge the current Germans with what their ancestors did eighty years ago, those Germans are basically all dead now. The Germans should play a central role in Europe now, and its time to remove U.S. bases from Germany. They need to be independent. The problem with accepting evidence about the Russians, is that groups in the USA and UK have in the past manufactured evidence and the media has jumped on board to with it. It was strange to watch news channels like CNN support a war like the Iraq war, where they filmed the bombing of a country and made a ton of money from it. There is a desire for complete media control, that makes it easier for agreement in the west but takes away independent thinking. What happened in the elections was that the mainstream media realized they were not all powerful anymore, this made them scared and they decided to point their finger at Russia who has a different outlook to mainstream western media. However the people who really influenced the election the most were the independent media channels and Trumps team who ran a more influential election campaign. John Oliver is really English although I guess he lives in the USA, but he pushes English propaganda and ideas or let us say mainstream western media ideas. Foreign people tried to influence the election whether they were Russian, English or from many other countries. Some people are stuck in the past, all they remember are things like the Soviet union or the Nazis, but the reality is that the world is different now and we have more sources of information to form our judgements whether they are foreign or local. A friendship between Russians and Americans would be a good thing for world peace. John Oliver is unwittingly supporting war lobbyists because he is helping support animosity towards Russia which is used to increase  militiary spending and conflict. War lobbyists are interested in making money and without an enemy like Russia the billions they get for weapons etc might get spent on healthcare or something more productive. It is obvious why hating on Russia indirectly supports war lobbyists, we can only pray people see this.",0.8679,466

Only the French, Spanish and their former colonies in Latin America tend to follow the 6 continent model instead of the more broadly understood 7 continent model. Only with them does the preposterous notion that North America and South America are part of 1 continent called ""America"" exist. Go ahead and tell a Canadian they're ""American"", see how well that goes for you. I'll copy and paste what a poster wrote on The Guardian:

 ""To everyone in the English speaking world, or that was taught a 7 continent model (this amounts to most people in the world), America is precisely a country, and only a country. No such continent called ""America"" exists in the English speaking world, only two, entirely separate, different continents called North America and South America exist. A nation called the United States of America exists, it is rationally called America in most of the world because no other ""America"" exists in most of the world, and the demonym for its people according to the world, and UN, is ""Americans"". Mexico's official name is ""United Mexican States"", but it's just Mexico.

Nazi symbolism is fucking outlawed there and holocaust denial is a crime. I think they've done more than enough to separate themselves from their ancestors. Don't pretend this is some sort of conspiracy with the media. They pointed the fingers at Russia because there was evidence they tampered with our election. As of now, we know this to be a fact. Shit, even the Trump administration had to finally agree with that. The difference between Russia and Germany is that Russia is still shit. Putin is a monster, and that's not something you can argue against. I'd rather not have to go to war with them, but being friends isn't exactly something we should do either. And if you want funding for healthcare, vote out Republicans. We have enough money to fund universal healthcare already if we divert it from our bloated military. Plus tax increases would be completely offset by affordable healthcare costs unlike now in which my tax cuts don't come close to covering my increased premiums.",-0.0677,223
