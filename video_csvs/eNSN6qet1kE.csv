"I would DEFINITELY recommend switching to a FOUR ENGINE SETUP.  Mainly because you will make it so the motors have MUCH LESS STRAIN on them and they will not have to work ANYWHERE NEAR as hard to keep you aloft - WHICH MEANS LESS CHANCE OF FAILURE, LESS ENGINE STRESS, MORE SAFETY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ALSO -  the wight of the two extra motors (total 4) really isn't that much heavier so the weight addition is NEGLIGIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",-0.6387,85
I've really enjoyed watching your projects in the past. And - I wasn't aware of this one - it's really cool. It just occurred to me from the video..the horizontal and vertical stabilizer really don't appear to be built to the standard of the other components. It's hard to tell from the video. But there's even what appears to be a bit of onset flutter in the video (I hope I'm mistaken about that and I could be). As a suggestion - consider removing the h-stab and v-stab and destructively testing them. It would make an interesting video. And they're easily re-built. Also calculate the design loads if you haven't already. I worry they may not be strong enough to carry the load of a well deflected rudder and/or elevator at speed. And that's something you'll need - and it's easily accomplished :),0.9431,159
