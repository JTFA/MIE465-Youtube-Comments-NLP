"This video was great, but I do have a couple of things that irk me. I personally would've made the tsuka (Handle) a bit thinner while making the tsuba (Hand guard) rounder, and finally I would've added a Bo-hi (Fuller; mistakenly called a ""Blood groove"" meant to lighten the blade but keep the strength). But those are just personal things and all in all it came out gorgeous, keep up the good work.",0.8779,88
