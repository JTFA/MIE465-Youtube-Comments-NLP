"To respond to all the morons out there. There is no doubt that Obama talks eloquently and could play the PART of the easygoing, amiable, sensitive Democrat. But, if you had a brain, which for Democrats is removed at birth, you would realize this was a carefully crafted image developed by the Democrats. The reality of him is terrifying. He was anti-American, anti-business, anti-prosperity, anti-freedom. He apologized for America every chance he got, and secretly worked to undermine the 1st, 2nd, and many other amendments through executive orders and other nefarious schemes. His mentor was and is Saul Alinsky, who wrote a book called Rules for Radical, which advocates collapsing a government from the inside out. Alinsky's tenants in his book read like a playbook for Obama's eight years in office. Most of you who worship at the Obama alter are too  stupid, lazy, or afraid to investigate what I said and seek the truth for yourself. If you still call yourself an Obama supporter, consider yourself one of the sheep, who would have been blindly led to the slaughter if it weren't for the intervention of your fellow Americans.",-0.5267,217
