"Being an actress not sounding Spanish while speaking English is actually something good. Otherwise you will always be the cliché latina. It's not about not sounding Spanish, it's about having a correct pronunciation, I am Catalan and I have different pronunciation in both Spanish and Catalan, because if I pronounced Spanish words as if I pronounced them in Catalan, I would sound stupid. Same in English, pronunciation is also important and I'd rather not be the latina that will call you ""papi"". :)",0.5106,94

"Edu San Miguel   I was born here in America and am of spanish/Italian descent (Mexican from my mother's side and Southern Italy from my Dad's). Yes, you are right about Americans identifying or or at worst, labeling someone just from a hint of an accent BUT that statement should be made about  everyone, in any country! It's very naive to think America is the only Country where its people try to identify a person's origin by their accent.  Please explain why the harsh words you used such as Fake, Pretend and Fragile were described for Americans when the subject was how a person appeared to want to hide THEIR accent thus representing all the things you accused Americans to be.  You mentioned Culture in America. There is no defined culture in America!  We are a melting pot of every nationality there is with the freedom to practice our own beliefs and not conform to the masses. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.",-0.8742,179

"yvonne rico lady, i love my country, which is Spain, and i am also in love with our culture and language. Now, with that being said, when i speak in English I try my best to sound as a native speaker, usually as an American since i lived there when i was younger. That doesn't mean at all that I feel sad or ashamed. I believe that you, as an American (my guess), identify accents with national  identities. That's pretty common there, your culture is so fake, fragile  and polarised that any little detail, like an accent in this case, is sign of identity. Reality is simpler, we feel  Spanish (or any other nationality) enough, to speak with an American accent and still feel proud of our language and heritage. We don't need to act in any specific way to feel as what we really are, in fact only Americans need to pretend  in order to keep being Americans.",0.8893,185
"yvonne rico yvonne rico I don't think you understood much of my comment, which of course is fine. Thus, I will try to explain my point once again. Yet, before anything: I am sorry that my words seem harsh to you but they were meant to be precise and  without bias, so the point wasn't hurting you. 
America, as you said is a conglomerate of people with very different backgrounds, however you do have an identity. That identity is result of creating contrast between those ethnicities, languages, etc that are found in American soil. Such a volatile identity is truly fragile and polarised inside itself as it is result of that, already mentioned, contrast. Maybe it isn't an exclusive social behaviour of America but after a lot of travel, study and friends from many many nationalities, I can argue, without a doubt,  that America carries the banner (by far) of having an identity as depicted, probably due to being a country founded by ""immigrants"" that promotes personal greatness. I refered to the actual genesis of the US in the previous sentence. When i said pretend, i do mean pretend. Americans can't relate to most of their fellow citizens because they are in fact quite different, economically too, therefore what you have left to create a useful tool, which is what an identity is, is you to pretend X. Pretend what? To be American. To this fact it adds that any sign of difference , like an accent, must be highlighted  and analysed. Usually not very intelligent analyses take place, in fact they always follow, logically though, an American critical thinking pattetn, which isn't precise  because it is influenced by your polarized conception of identity.
I'd like to point out one last thing: Mexican and Spanish identities have absolutely nothing to do so you aren't of Spanish descendants. We are very different as the earlier belongs to the Latin American culture, in which countries are already quite different between themselves,  and the latter is a ""mixture"" of western europe and Mediterranean cultures. Yes, we do share the language, but we have little to do with them. And please don't try to argue this point, it would be dumb.",0.963,423
