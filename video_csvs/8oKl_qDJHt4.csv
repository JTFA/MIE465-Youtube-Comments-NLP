"How old is this footage?  I ask, because of the woman asking for $38 for a bus ride home.  Two days before Thanksgiving, I handed that woman $50.  If she's still sitting on corners in the City, I'm sorry to tell you that we've both been scammed.

While I love the concept, what you need to remember is that this City and charities are surprisingly good about providing resources and services for the indigent, i.e. public housing, food, clothing, etc.  The ones you see on the street are out there _by choice_.  And they make that choice because people give money (and now goods) like this.  As panhandling becomes more ""profitable,"" more panhandlers appear.  So if the goal is to get people off the streets, this is ironically anti-useful.

You ought to do an expos√© in which you follow them home after their panhandling ""shift"" on a corner.  You'll be surprised.",0.9393,184

We have 7(!) so called ""presidents"", and yet we the citizens get to decide how the country is run (direct democracy). Not Donald Trump and his fuck tards. It is also sad to see that so many presidents and congress cannot fix so many things that are wrong in the USA. Sure, there are countries that are far worse at state. But America is a rich country, that doesn't share in a fair way. Donald Trump has not made America Great again in his 1st Year. He has made it worse, or better for the rich.",-0.9372,180

"Two really easy ways to do something similar: 
Buy a big multipack of white socks when you're shopping, usually less than $1/pair. Then, every time you go out walking in a big city, put a couple of pair in your pockets. If you drive, just keep the pack in your car. When you see someone who looks like they need it, offer them a pair or two. If they're not scamming, they'll be super happy to get them....
Second, go to the travel section of a store and buy the small sizes of soap, shampoo, first aid kit, toothbrush with toothpaste and a cover, hand sanitizer, and whatever else looks good. Then get some socks, always white, and add gloves and beanies if it's winter. Last, look for really cheap backpacks.... I found some for $2.50 when school was starting. You'll be amazed at what you can put together for about $20 each bag. Then, same thing... When you go out for the night, take one with you until you see someone who needs it, or keep them in the backseat of your car to hand out at intersections. My last trip to NYC, I made up most of 5 bags at home and added water and a couple of other things once I got to town, then I took 4 out to Times Square one night.... When I didn't see a lot of homeless in the area, I asked a police officer where I should look and they directed me to the Transit Authority. I found 4 people who needed those bags within 15 minutes probably.
It's not hard to make giving part of your routine...",0.9814,320
