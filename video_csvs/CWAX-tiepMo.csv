"-Cinder has kind of been set up to be Ruby's villain, especially with wanting revenge on Ruby.
-Raven is not a hero.  
-They finally had Cinder come back into the fold after recovering all of Volume 4, and the only person to witness the fight was Vernal.  Not even Yang saw what happened.
-They just showed off that Cinder has Grimm parts now, which would be a pointless reveal if they killed her immediately afterward.
-No confirmed death or body, and to the best of my knowledge, the writers have not confirmed her fate, which they did do for characters like Roman and Pyrrha.

Mark my words.  Cinder will return with even more Grimm parts, and even less sane.",-0.9492,139
"-It doesn't matter what Cinder has set up to be. Not everyone gets revenge. Life is unfair like that.
-Did I say Raven was a hero? She was just eliminating an enemy like any other person would.
-Yes, Cinder did just come back after recovering, and this was a way of showing how it clearly wasn't enough.
-Revealing something new like a Grimm arm doesn't mean she has to stay in the series for another five volumes. The arm served its purpose - injuring Vernal. No one said it had to be more than that.
-Of course there's no confirmed death or body - that's how suspense works. The series ended about a month ago; the writers still have enough time to confirm her death, or they might not. No one said they had to.

If Cinder comes back, then I guess the people who like Cinder will be happy? I just think her time has come and passed, especially after we've seen people like Salem, Tyrian, and Hazel. I guess I won't be angry if she comes back, but it might seem cheesy after she _already came back once._",-0.127,220
"-Mastery of dust
-Tall as a mountain (which is much, much bigger than the large room they were in this episode)
-Ten times faster than a character whose semblance is *speed*
-Absolute control over Grimm

Salem on the other hand can direct Grimm, has shown no indication of being skilled at combat or dust yet, has only been seen at walking speed, and might be able to grow in size.  How are those two equal in any way?

If we were putting this in a situation where all the characters were household pets, and Salem was some wild animal like a wolf, than your guy would be a short-faced bear or large dinosaur.",0.2732,130

In my personal opinion: Having Ruby assume the Maiden's power would be a cop-out. A cheap way to upgrade her 'power-batteries' without her having to 'grow' (for lack of a better word) or engage in any effort or deal with hardship in order to become more capable and refined.

Weiss, Blake and Yang each had to endure hardship and overcome personal obstacles in order to grow as a character. Giving Ruby simply a power boost would be ... uninteresting.",0.6498,115

"Here are my overall thoughts on volumes 4-5. I love them more than volumes 1-3. Mostly because it fits the set up scene perfectly, you know that scene where we first hear the voice of Salem and Ozpin in episode 1 of the show. That scene set the world up to be very dark, only for the next 3 seasons to show none of that except for the finales of volumes 2 and 3. Volumes 4-5 are incredible with the story writing taking it up a notch on character depth. I actually think the most developed character in the show is Jaune, because this guy is constantly beaten down by others who are stronger but still keeps a smile on his face, and I love how he holds up to his character when he fights Cinder and he says that his friends matter more than his own life. And to all the torchwick fans out there, there are better villains in the show, Tyrian and Hazel. Tyrian already is a better villain right when he showed how crazy he could get in volume 4 episode 1, I still have that nervous chuckle when he says, “eye for an eye”. And although volume 4 was a bit slower, that’s because they took the time to set up future volumes, but to also have some breathing room for the characters and set them up. Like I said with Jaune, in episode 2 of volume 4, that ending scene was so heartbreaking to watch because even though Pyrrha sacrificed herself to save Jaune, he holds himself responsible for her death, that’s why he constantly has reminders of her on and around him as a way of torturing himself. Volumes 4-5 are the best in my opinion.",0.8201,324

"How does it not make sense? Cinder was a child with a simple lust for power, and nothing more. Deep down, she was weak. Raven was the perfect one to show her that, being the only known character to have the strength to fight her other than Salem's followers. After Volumes 3 and 4, the viewers really needed a victory, and our heroes' showing Salem that they weren't going to go down without a fight was just the way to do it, in my opinion.",0.4767,97

I can't knock the animation too much because off Monty's afformentioned passing, but it  just lacks the same rhythm and flashiness older volumes had. I just don't know if I can say I enjoy watching this show anymore. It's not a good sign when you feel like nostalgia alone is what holds your interest in something.",-0.7278,112

"This is widely my own general speculation, so do not take this to heart, nor troll or defame this. Here it goes.

RWBY is now back again, which can only mean there's a LOT of storytelling once again, not only from Blake's view but from the other three, plus Qrow. Given the circumstances that brought about up to now, at least she deserves of what's really going on here, the endgame: Salem. We still haven't heard from Glynda since Volume 3, not could we ever expect her to show up in Volume 6, let alone in Atlas or Beacon (though the latter seems extremely unlikely, knowing its now Ground Zero). Which brings me up to Atlas. Concerning General Ironwood and Father Schnee, its more plausible that Ironwood would be that the relics is real, that Salem is a real, true threat, and she's coming to claim all 4 of them, and that Ironwood is more likely to jump into the fray with Qrow, RWBY and the rest. Schnee on the other hand, thinks that the army of Atlas will take care of the job, and that will be his downfall. Not only he'll fail to see that both of his daughter's has grown up on their own (moreso in Weiss's case), but his hubris into thinking an army of trained and automated soldiers is more than a match for Salem will have him question and doubt himself (if he is even capable of humility and the like) Winter may join in the fight, but once again just like Glynda, we've yet to see her since S3. We can also expect a lot more training for the fabulous seven (RWBY and the remaining members of JNPR). 

There's still a lot of questions unanswered, that much is certain. Guess we'll find out in Season 6.",0.8885,346
This makes so much sense now. The weird tentacles going after lion heart is him dying by that weird jellyfish tentacled grim in the intro song thing! And Salem coming up from the floor is emeralds illusion of Salem being shown in front of team RWBY! It makes sense going back to see everything now!!,-0.8057,60

Vicente 810 - Well spoken. Not only that but the realization that her own mother is an amoral opportunistic butcher on exactly the same level as Cinder probably fully sank in at the moment as well. Or so I believe ...,-0.09,43
Volume 1 and 2 are the best. Volume 3 is pretty good but kinda sloppy. Volume 4 didn't make me excited for 5 and volume 5 didn't excite me or make me glad that I finished it. I gave up on volume 5 because it got so boring after a while but I finished it because I thought that it would've gotten better. This ending was a mess to me but I can still say that it could get better hopefully,0.8307,85

He can use all the dust to his needs without error, and he can control Grimm with a snap of his fingers. I call him Makarin, aka the devil's toolmaker. He had a mask like the top half of a Grimm's face, and when he puts it on, he can be ten times as fast as Ruby. He's only weakness is his chest, where I bright red flame burns. It can hop around his body, but not very quickly. He is by far the most powerful Grimm by far.",0.9316,134
