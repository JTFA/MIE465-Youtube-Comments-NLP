"As a foster child myself growing up. Watching her speak is like looking at a sister. Same energy with so much to share. The way she takes the stage and uses the history.... wow... Ive never had the courage to share publicly. Although Ive seen the beautiful impact and transformations Ive been able to be part of when I have opened and shared myself with others. Every time i watch her. Feels like home. Glad to see another one of us embracing our childhood. I feel like I can take on the world at the same time as bridge the gaps and relate to just about anyone anywhere and use that energy to heal and move so many things because of the times I faced as a child growing up in DCFS in Chicago. It was blessing in disguise I wish I could do more with and hope to one day. Too many left behind without hope and feeling lost. What I would give to other children like me... Everything I wish I had. Number 1 being...  just someone to talk to who understands and will listen, compassionate and love. Whos been through the same thing and knows how it is. Transform that energy and let them know hey its okay. ONe day like me they will look back and see how much strength and character came from those days AND hopefully use those memories to fuel and power their future 💕",0.9947,262

"I believe growing up in foster care with several different families and cultures gave me this urge as an adult to want to understand and know more. Now I live traveling world wide and in countries all over the world embracing all cultures and exploring deeper the things I wish to understand, connecting to pieces of my childhood, and just embracing life and its wonders.Never having a steady home definitely made it possible for me to feel like home anywhere in the world. Right now Im currently in India. And wow...  after a year or so back and forth living here.... Growing up tough makes you see other kids and what they have and it kinda hurts that you dont have a life thats more typical.... but India. India will humble you and give so much gratitude. Yes I grew up in really not so wonderful ways but these people live the same, and many in far worst, but its normal here. And yet they wear a smile everyday. Even when their house in on the street and made of tarps and sticks. One thing someone said to me as a child that stuck out and really rings here... ""yes dear, you may have it bad, but somewhere out there someone has it just a little worst than you""... No pain can outweigh anothers. As it all hurts the same. But definitely seeing the strength in people throughout my life is what deeply influenced me and many days kept me going 💕",-0.6861,275

"I have a hard time believing she hasn't found the laughter in most things throughout life. She seems like shes always TURNED WAY UP, lol and sometimes you have to have the right hook up and connections and everything has to line up right in the galaxy and the zodiacs and all that mumbo jumbo for you to come out on top like she did.  But i can tell she is still dealing with some of it.",0.678,81
"I have this feeling that not even half the fuckers there has even touched her book, and the audience just gets paid to sit there and applauded, the anchors will probably talk shit about her, they each get script and they read it, tiffany just does whatever the fuck she wants and they hate her for it but the people love her. They tried to embarrass her with that hype song to make her dance like an idiot there were definitely better parts to talk about than her being a hype girl. So she did it but she made him her bitch, plus Robyn just had the fakest smile on, she literally can't stand   tiffany. And then when they were about to give away her book, she look like she was about to throw it, but they were still air, probably surprised her with it, and then she had to play off, the black dude is just laughing to hard for it to be real. And the white dude is just sitting there he kind of looked like a corpse. Plus they were all acting super fucking suspicious, like tiffany saw something she shouldn't have, for example Robyn being the black and the white guys dominatrix maybe some s'm and puppy play, and shes letting them know she knows, and when Robyn asked why tiffany was looking at them like that and she said "" i always wanted a tesla so you think you could get me one. You got all that money"" how much you want to bet she's going to have a tesla soon. She knows these things about them possibly more, they will do as she wants. Or it's just the weed",0.97,310
