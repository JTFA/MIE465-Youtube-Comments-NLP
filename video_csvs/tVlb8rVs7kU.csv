"Just one technical note, speaking as an electrician, the blue wire is normally the neutral which should not be switched; the switch should be in the brown.

"Nice idea, you can get a lever type microswitch, same thing but with a lever, gives you more hysteresis, the one you have will operate with the slightest of movement (vibrations from the wind your movement in the house etc), but the lever type won't. ;)

"Nicely done, but I have one remark. You wrote on your website, that you love to show the process of creating something. Imho, your videos lack one aspect, the thinking. You showed the need and the creating process, but not the how and why you did what you did. I think that's really hard to show when you aren't saying anything in a video. Nonetheless, keep up the good work!",0.926,82

"Wow! I used to hear Jeremy, James, and Richard talk about Germans as the pinnacle of craftsman. Well, it's very clear they were right in those regards. That shelf is immaculate. You even bevelled the screws holes so that they would sit flush. (You're polish, aren't you? Meh, it doesn't matter. The countries are so close, I wouldn't put it past you to have German ancestors.) Well done.",0.8531,85
