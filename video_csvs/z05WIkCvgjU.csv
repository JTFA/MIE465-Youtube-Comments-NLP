nice try clown the Ertz touchdown was clearly a touchdown he caught the ball took 3 steps established himself as a runner and dove in the end zone and crossed the plane before and the clement touchdown was legit as well Corey Clement caught the ball and secured it than he moved the ball to his other hand so he could brace for the fall and maintain control he had control the whole time you can move the ball to your other hand as long as you have control your just salty because the Pats lost just a typical delusional Patriots fan,0.9403,102
