"Lexuz Salinas I’m not upset, I just think it’s stupid that they aren’t even trying hard for these vids. There’s youtubers who are doing better jobs and achieving better results.

"This has got to be the stupidest series by Refinery. No one actually turns out looking like their intended celebrity unless you watch the video when you’re high and half blind.
They should at least change the name of the series and say the looks are “inspired by” or try harder and make the people look more like the celebs they’re  trying to imitate.",-0.5106,73
