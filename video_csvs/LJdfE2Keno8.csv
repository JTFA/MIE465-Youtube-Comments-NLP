Cody airspun loose powder!!!!,-0.5374,7
"Colourpop is not considered drugstore makeup. Maybelline, L’Oréal, CoverGirl, etc. With so many guru channels out there, it is surprising that you choose to do something that has been done a million times before. Look, the girl can’t do makeup. Sorry. Color scheme is especially jarring.",0.2023,61

High end is on the left🤞,0.0,7
"I GOT IT RIGHT guess im a
baller",0.0,8
"I LOVE all of these high end vs. drug store videos. I think an interesting component would be an analysis of the ingredients in the products. Or, I guess a look into why each company can charge what they do.",0.824,45
I LOVE that you guys used cruelty free pruducts. Also love this makeup look!,0.8697,16
I can tell one side is oily so the right is the high end,0.0,14
"I did guess right! It was a wild guess though, I honestly couldn't tell. DEFINITELY going to get my hands on the colourpop shadow palette now! I was on the fence but... that price! Always love your videos Mi-Anne! :D",0.891,47
I didn't like the high end makeup look     I liked the drugstore look better,0.5559,14
I don't even wear makeup and I have already knew which side was which. HA.,0.4824,17

I got it wrong!!! 😮😮😮😮🤪,-0.6093,11
"I got it wrong, they look sooo similar",-0.4767,9
I guessed it haha!,0.5093,5
"I guessed right! What gave it away was the one side of eyeshadow clearly blended better, your skin looked more even, and the lipstick was a better formula and looked more natural. I find high end makeup works into the skin more, whereas cheaper makeup tends to sit on top of the skin, and looks (albeit only slightly) less natural.",0.9346,69
"I guessed the high end vs drugstore sides because I know what that Marc Jacobs bronzer looks like on skin, it’s pretty out there.",0.6908,28
"I love all of the ""beauty with mi's""",0.8402,10
"I love that the video featured cruelty free makeup. Not a lot of people care or know about makeup testing on animals, and that sometimes they end up injured or dead. No one should want to harm animals just for their beauty since there is plenty of cruelty free makeup you can buy instead",-0.34,57
I love the makeup videos with Mi!,0.6696,8
I love your eyeshadow!!,0.6988,6
I loved that you used drugstore brushes with the drugstore makeup! Brushes make such a big difference in makeup application and I really appreciate the attention to detail you put into this video.,0.8012,35

"I recently started using WW foundation and concealer and love them. In my opinion, their quality is better than Clinique and Lâncome.",0.7964,25
I think it would have nice to point out that the rms and Pacifica are both natural Makeup brands which are always a bit more expensive. Although RMS is on the more expensive side of natural. Pacifica is actually pretty decently priced for green beauty.,0.93,48

I was the drugstore side looked so flawless and glowy. 😍,0.6418,12

Idk which ones which but the right side looks better in my opinion minus the lipstick,0.5647,16
"If someone, anyone, even just one person takes something away from this comment section it’s that the Natasha Denona sunset palette (or Lila I LOVE that one too) is SOOO worth it! I know it’s not what people usually spend on eyeshadow or usually have the money for but if you have the money GO FOR IT! And if you don’t but you really like makeup I def suggest this is an item worth saving and splurging!",0.8842,90
