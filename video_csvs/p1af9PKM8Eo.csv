"12,345 views, 3K likes, 0 dislikes. I'm glad that there are no dislikes. Jonghyun wouldn't have deserved that.
He shined bright, and was the source of happiness for many, including myself. He's only shining in a different place, and hopefully, without the pain he felt on this earth. May he rest in peace, and I hope his memory never withers.
Remember Kim Jonghyun, April 8th 1990 - 18th December 2017",0.9477,84

"Lonely (Feat. 태연) - 종현 (JONGHYUN)
미안해 내 탓이야 고마워 덕분이야
툭하면 내뱉던 네 그 말버릇
너도 힘든 걸 난 다 아는데
아마 넌 내가 바본 줄 아나 봐
우는 얼굴로 나 힘들다 하면
정말 나아질까
그럼 누가 힘들까 아프다 징징대면
모두 다 괜찮아지는데
아마 너와 난 착각 속에
서로를 가둬둔 지 몰라
아냐 너는 날 이해 못 해
걱정 어린 네 눈을 볼 때면
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
나는 혼자 있는 것만 같아요
지친 널 볼 때면 내가 너에게
혹시 짐이 될까 많이 버거울까
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
나도 혼자 있는 것만 같아요
그래도 너에게 티 내기 싫어
나는 혼자 참는 게 더 익숙해
날 이해해줘
우린 함께 있지만 같이 걷질 않잖아
외로움과 괴로움
기억 하나 차인 건데
넌 왜 자꾸 다르게만
적으려 하는 건지
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
나는 혼자 있는 것만 같아요
그래도 너에게 티 내기 싫어
나는 혼자 참는 게 더 익숙해
날 이해해줘
날 내버려 둬
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
나는 혼자 있는 것만 같아요
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
나도 혼자 있는 것만 같아요
그래도 너에게 숨기기 싫어
나는 혼자 참는 게 더 익숙해
날 이해해줘",-0.9735,206

"OMG!  The stars always have to show only the happy, good, bright side of their personality to the world, friends and family. But they always fear showing their dark side.  EVERYONE HAS A DARK SIDE. If you cannot express your dark side to someone you can trust, and who will not to condemn you just because you show them you are not perfect; then that dark side will grow inside you and take you to a very lonely and sad place inside your own mind that no one else can reach easily (or perhaps ever) like what happened to poor Jong Hyun ( may he rest in peace ).",0.8489,121

"Once, when I was younger, I went to a funeral for the first time, and I was sad because it was my bestfriend's father who died. I didn't cry too much because I thought that death is something that will happen to all of us. But when Jonghyun died, I lost my everything. I lost a boy who was on my mind for 3 years (since I started listening to kpop). I lost his beautiful eyes, his unexplainable smile, his angel voice, his sense of humour. And it hurts that I'm going through a lot of pain, too. He was the only one who kept me alive, and now he's gone. How am I supposed to hold on anymore? I can't. It hurts.

Jonghyun, my love, I hope that one day I'll come there, in a beautiful place called Heaven, where your soul plays the kazoo in the angels' choir, and without looking around, I'll find you and jump to your arms without saying anything but: ""I missed you. I love you"". God, I can't wait for that day. I will wait for thousands of years just to see you and feel your hug. People say that love is worth the wait. Well, I'm waiting.

You didn't do well.
You did awesome.

Jonghyun, I will always love you. See you soon. ❤",0.9864,266

Terjemahan Lagu Jonghyun Lonely
Maafkan aku, ini salahku
Terima kasih, semuanya terima kasih
Ini adalah kata-kata yang Anda katakan karena kebiasaan
Meskipun aku tahu kau juga sedang berjuang
Anda mungkin menganggap saya bodoh
Jika saya mengatakan bahwa hal-hal yang sulit dengan wajah menangis
Apakah itu akan menjadi lebih bai",-0.9871,249

the song just break my heart into pieces again... i still can't believe he had leaves us.. even though he is not my bias in shinee.. he'll always be in my heart.. it's funny somehow to start loving someone who wasn't here with us anymore.. we can't do anything except for being in love and hurt at the same time.. Rest in piece kim jonghyun..,0.8358,72

why is this song so symbolic telling us that he really had no one by his side? 😞 i'm out of words. oh god jonghyun. you're not alone ! we didn't want to see you like this! oh god i feel so ashamed of myself for not knowing him thoroughly. but i am certain that this angel is in gods hands and is sleeping peacefully. rest in peace to this charming angel that has attacked many hearts❤️😞,0.9464,86
