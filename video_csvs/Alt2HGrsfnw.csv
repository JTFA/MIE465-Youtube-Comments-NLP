Doing that day after day it is really just a matter of time before something goes wrong and you severely injure your hand.

"What's funny is I have the pineapple one. I was ready to argue on it's behalf, because I love it. But you nailed it. Seriously, it works great, and if you eat as much pineapple as my kids and I do you will love it.",0.9413,52

"Why anybody would pay for these cheap ass unitaskers is beyond me.  They're pricey for what they are, cheap enough that they won't last for long, complicated to clean with all their nooks and crannies, take up space in your utility drawer, and above all, THEY USUALLY COMPLICATE SHIT RATHER THAN MAKE IT EASIER.  They're all gimmicks.  Just learn some basic knife skills, and you're set.",-0.4588,76
"Why are you the judge in this?  Your opinion is too biest,  I like the explanation of how the devices fill to be used but I still don't think you should be the judge,  it should be blindly judged.",0.1901,43

Would be interesting to get 2 pineapples with the same weight (minus the top and bottom) then cut using the tool and knife then weigh the fruit and skin to see how much was still attached to the skin. I‚Äôm guessing a bit more on the skin than some good knife work. But that‚Äôs just 10 years in professional level kitchen talking,0.6486,70

"You can't say the knife wins cuz you don't like the results! Wtf is that? At least present why the knife is better. The knife is a ""multitasker"" and you could've very easily made that point. But instead, you made an episode about unitaskers and highlighting them only to say you don't like them. The message in this video is very unclear. It needs a dialogue. A statement, an application, a result, and a conclusion. But a clear message most of all",0.4352,96

corers are the most useful common knife unitaskers i find. Apple corers are great if you want round slices and pitting cherries is awful. Pineapple corers tend to be more wasteful though. I mean potato chippers are also unitaskers I suppose.,0.6801,45
"cut the pinappple wrong and i think knife skills win if you do it right.  Top/bottom, skin as you did, then cut in 4 longways and then 45 degree cut the core out of each quarter, then cut each quarter longways in half and stack and then dice into chunks.  also.... saved you less than a minute, call it 30 seconds being generous after you  rinse the thing",0.1027,77

"the bit where the skin meets the rest of the fruit is where it's most sour and the the skin's texture is a nice contrast to the squishy insides.
