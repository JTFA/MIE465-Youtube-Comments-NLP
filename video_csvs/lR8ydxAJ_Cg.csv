What is a ""jewish"" food? Is there one particular country where 
all ""jews"" come from? I don't think so. So, why are all ""jews"" 
lumped together as if they have one particular place of origin?
""Jew"" is a concept and not a reality. There is no ethnicity
called ""jew"" nor is there a religion called the jewish religion,
it is called Judaism and you don't have to be a ""jew"" to be 
a follower of the religion.

Where do you come from? I come from the Land of Catholicism.
Sounds stupid, doesn't it. Do all Christians come from the same 
place?

It is all a Zionist trick to fool the goyim of the world that ""jews"" 
are a special and distinct race -- NOT. Read Shlomo Sand's 
book, ""The Invention of the Jewish People.""
