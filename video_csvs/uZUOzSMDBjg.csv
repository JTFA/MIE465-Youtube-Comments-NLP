"Always find it more compelling when people  put together their own costume out of real clothing items. Or just work with a costume and then alter it or make jet more unique. I did basically the same thing for an (expensive to be sure) Queen of Hearts Halloween costume that changes and evolves every year I wear it. Bases are red and black but I can grunge it down, or fancy it up with some gold and white accents if I choose.
If I wanted I could even work with what I have there and make a Harley costume. Already have done a Ringmaster with different accessories which also works as a high wire girl with the addition of an umbrella. 

Want to do the same with an Ursula/maleficent costume as well. Hopefully this year for Ursula.",0.8045,150

However, something you said worried me, the ""not being able to breathe in this corset""-part. As a corset wearer, I can tell you this is not supposed to be the case. Corsets are supposed to be pretty comfortable. Now, this isn't reaaally a ""good corset"", but it should still be fine. Maybe you're not used to not being able to belly-breathe since your midriff is restricted? 
Anyways, if you plan on wearing corsets more often you should check out Lucy's Corsetry here on YT, she's a pro.
