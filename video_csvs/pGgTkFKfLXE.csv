"Cristy Sanchez 

  Hi Cristy  no I have never heard of it but then look at all the shade that was written about them. I believe that 
Amelia felt left out and was also a little jealous and I think that's why she was with him  so much after the first movie. 
For me I think she should have had more faith in him and trusted him I don't believe he 
Would ever hurt her. Do I think she should have done what she done NO NO but that's me
It was not Jamie and Dakotas
Time to share the limelight 
Not Amelia's. When your married you should have built
Love trust to a point that no
Jealousy can creep in and that should have been settled
Before you got married. 
It's AMILIA WHO HE HAS ALWAYS COME HOME TO
AND ITS HER  BED THAT HE
OCCUPIES AND HE SLEEPS 
IN. 
    Remember if you plant the seeds mistrust you do damage because once planted the roots grow and spread and the love you have wii Shrivel up and die and jealousy is a green eyed monster and once it's let loose it's so hard to contain. 

Thank you for texting me and for letting me voice my opinion I respect yours and 
Want to change it  Bye❣️❣️",-0.4422,227

Hi but they wouldn't bring problems if his wife trusted him. Don't forget Amelia was with him on half of the filming of FSOG and all of FSF that spells trouble to me. It was 
Fantasy nothing more and she knew what the movies were about she didn't trust him and that's sad. If she keeps it up trouble will follow. If you accuse someone of something they didn't do and keep it up soon they will do it. 
I like Amelia and Jamie and 
Dakota but what Amelia did was wrong and sad. Did you see any other spouse there a on the red carpet? NO !!!!!

Yes we know Jaime you two don’t have any chemistry one of the many reasons other the terrible script but yeah if the couple had some fireworks would help. But you are amazing actor in the Fall!!!,0.9221,43
You can kinda tell that they both regret taking the roll for these horrendous movies (the bookisnt any better) the franchise overall is just garbage,-0.765,27

"hearsaytruth : I don't think you saw the movies then,  Just the clips,  because she changed from one movie to the other, so did Jamie even though it was suppose to be just five days  between the breakup and them getting back together.  There are a lot of people that think she is a beautiful young woman. Your opinion of her is yours, not mine.",0.5994,72
"hearsaytruth : I see you're talking and not knowing what any of this is about. Another person who haven't read the books or seen the movies. This trilogy is actually about Anastasia and not Christian, as you stated, if you had read the books you would have known that. Those two brought those books to life, and were perfect for the parts.  So Dakota has a small gap in her teeth, she's not ashamed of it, and believe me she has the money to fix it if she want to. She is a naturally beautiful young woman who has been making movies since about twelve years old. Jamie came in being the unknown, and this trilogy made him famous.",0.8874,132

sherry cannon  i  think he is jealous,-0.4588,7
sherry cannon I agree with u. I was shocked he would say something that disparaging about his so called friend. It would serve him right if Dakota gives him a taste of his on medicine. I heard so many rumors about him and his cheating ass. EL James and Universal should thank Jamie for the bang up job he’s done promoting this last film which he clearly hates.,-0.4256,75

"what! there's gonna be more of Grey? agreed about Dakota. she's just so bland and even ugly sometimes. it's a shame they picked an average becky to play opposite such a stunning gorgeous man. The movie and storyline are so terrible i almost left the movie theater in the middle of the movie but decided to stay. Hated Rita ora as hi sister and that white dude as ana's ex. horrible actors and horrible acting, too much meaningless sex. bad movie overall. however i did love all the amazing soundtracks. Especially Bishop briggs' version of tear us apart. love Jamie too. this movie didnt really show his acting potential. but im glad that this movie made him even more famous",-0.4882,135
