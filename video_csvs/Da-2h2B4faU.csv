“From the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons. They danced in prayer or so that their crops would be plentiful or so their hunt would be good. And they danced to stay physically fit and show their community spirit. And they danced to celebrate. And that, that is the dancing that we’re talking about. Aren’t we told in Psalm 149: ‘Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song. Let them praise His name in the dance’?…It was King David. King David, who we read about in Samuel, and, and what did David do? What did David do? What did David do? ‘David danced before the Lord with all his might, leaping, leaping and dancing before the Lord.’ Leaping and dancing! Ecclesiastes assures us that there is a time to every purpose under heaven. A time to laugh and a time to weep. A time to mourn and there is a time to dance. And there was a time for this law, but not anymore. See, this is our time to dance. It is our way of, of celebrating life. It’s the way it was in the beginning. It’s the way it’s always been. It’s the way it should be now.”

"I'm only a few minutes in, and I love it, however the brain does not ""create images"" nor, as far as we know is there any place in a brain where an image lives or where we live. This is the fallacy of Descartes, the homunculus. The true nature of perception, of representation, of the relationship of that lump of gray between your ears to the world in which there is a ""you"" that has experiences is something much more complicated and less straightforward. I find it interesting that you begin by asking ""what is seeing?"", perhaps you can do a follow up video on the nature of experience. You could begin with seeing, move to other sensations and perceptions and do so while addressing the nature of experiencing, the logical consequences to our understanding of our own sensations and perceptions of various theories (e.g. predictive coding accounts, cartesian theatre, panpsychism(s)/panexperentialism(s)). I know you have touched on some things like this before, but not in much detail.

"In the video we introduced Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in terms of the effects of a measurement (what is sometimes called the observer effect). The two concepts are not exactly the same, but the observer effect provides an intuitive physical interpretation of the uncertainty principle---in fact Heisenberg himself used it as a physical justification of his principle. A more precise way to introduce Heisenberg's principle is to see that very small objects, such as elementary particles, behave like waves: a famous experiment in quantum mechanics shows that electrons going past an obstacle ""diffract"", i.e. they go around the obstacle. This is similar to how sound waves behave: if you sit in theater behind a column, you can still hear the music. The uncertainty principle is then a mathematical consequence of this wave description, or in more mathematical terms of the fact that ""quantum observable do not commute"". In this sense it is not a principle in itself, but a consequence of the axioms of quantum mechanics; yet, given its historical importance in the development of quantum mechanics and the fact that it is a basic feature of quantum mechanical effects, physicists think of it as a founding principle of quantum physics. It is indeed correct that, while the observer effect gives an intuitive way to justify Heisenberg's principle, nowadays physicists distinguish between the two, and they have been working hard to better understand their subtle differences.",-0.5647,266
"Instead of replacing zero dimensional particles of particle physics with one dimensional strings, wouldn't it make more sense to replace those particles with four dimensional objects? clearly, the universe is at least four dimensional, so the elementary 'particles' should also be four dimensional, right? strangely I couldn't find anything of this sort in Google, I'd guess few people have tried this approach because it sounds like a computational nightmare.",0.5204,79

sound waves move slower than light so would it maybe be possible to use a machine that can do something similar to echolocation or is this just a dumb idea that i thought of?,-0.5106,35
sounds like string theory is more unknowns than knowns,0.3612,9
the first half gave me a bad jolt but im into that sort of stuff i like the alien feel of it. like vertigo or cognitive dissonance. its so hard to find these days if anyone felt the jolt that i felt and know of any more material similiar to that sort of like playtest on black mirror that feeling please let me know. its very hard to find. if i were to give it a name it would be nihilistic cosmic horror,0.06,87
"the first part of this video is not correct. Although saying that we cannot see fundamental particles is correct, this is NOT THE HEISENBERG UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is saying (in a simple form) that the more you know something like mass (say you know this to an infinite accuracy) the less you will know the momentum of what you are measuring.Isaac Newton had a theory that if you had a snooker table and you could measure the momentum to an absolute extent then you could predict what happened in the past for the ball and the future. If you crashed 2 particles together and you knew the momentum infinitely accurate then you will not know where the particles are. This is really complicated to explain but I'm not saying that the video is bad I'm saying that it is scientifically incorrect. The principle you used is the OBSERVER EFFECT.

p.s Keep up the AMAZING videos!!!!",0.4021,174
