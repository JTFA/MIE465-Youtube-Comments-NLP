"Also the best breastfeeding tip is if your daughter is lucky enough to latch on, after her feed for the first couple of days give her a cup or syringe of formula milk (if you google you will be able to find good examples of this) and then express after every feed. It‚Äôs very tiring but what the doctors and midwifes don‚Äôt tell you is that some women‚Äôs milk take longer to come in, so even if it looks like your baby is feeding they might not be getting everything they need! My daughter was taking into hospital and put on a drip because even though she was latched on perfectly, my milk just needed more stimulation to come out. If you look there are so many articles on women facing the same thing. Breastfeeding isn‚Äôt as easy as it looks and if you look into every outcome you are more than likely to achieve perfect breastfeeding!!",0.9783,176

"Fleur, just a suggestion before the baby is here.  As it is winter and as a newborn your little girl will have a developing immune system (plus the inability to regulate her body temperature) you may want to reconsider moving the crib near the door away from the windows to avoid any direct draft.  Health-wise the crib would be better placed in the spot where you have your daybed to provide the most warmth if she is the room napping etc.  You can always caddy corner the daybed where the crib is until she gets a bit bigger and the weather warms up.  Just a thought.  Good luck.  P.S.-Lovely nursery!",0.9019,125

"Hi Fleur, When I was renovating my kitchen I had some cupboards where the mdf was double the thickness of the usual size. No doorknob would fit because the screws were way to short. So in the end I ended up opting for knobs where the knob would twist onto the screw. Not ones where the screw is built in with the screw. This way I took the screw that came with the knob to a specialty hardware store and was able to get a longer version that fit perfectly. :)
Your nursery is stunning by the way. Have been watching you since you were at university and I always loved your style and taste.",0.9169,123

I didn't like neither one, but my son loves both. The clowns are colorful, and when he was smaller (he's 5 months now), he would be mesmerized by their colors. The plastic animals came in handy when he started grabbing stuff (around the 3,5-month mark), it has a lower setting and they turn slowly above him, he grabs the animals and chews on them.
