I have my own hauling business and I'm happy to be able to repair my own equipment.  It would be really nice if the legislation covered all electronic devices so we could repair any electronic device that ""isn't supported"".  The reason Apple showed up to The hearing is because these farmers are challenging the fundamental mechanism behind their funding stream.  The large tech companies out date devices so you continuously must buy new products and update, therefore (and get this) not just simple farmers get the right to repair, and create longevity, but so do the Japanese, the Chinese, the Russians and other government sponsored high tech companies.  It's a really big deal.  Tech companies clearly understand that more longevity for the customer means less money for them and more for the customers thereby directly devaluing their new products and forcing customers to buy newer more expensive products.  Hence the new GPS on the farmers shelf.  If it's not supported, it's worthless, if it's repairable or modifiable it retains a great deal of worth.

I do know that thousands of dollars are spent each year by each dealership for training to fix the equipment.

"John Deere won't be interviewed and won't let Motherboard check out the dealership repair facilities, but they will release a statement saying ""Can't we all just get along and not get government involved?""  YOU CAUSED THIS!  Instead of innovating how you interact with customers, you instead say ""you buy from us and you can ONLY repair from us and... btw... we won't provide you ANY diagnostic information short of taking your machine to a dealer... AND you cannot buy second hand parts for repairs because they will be disabled on your tractor (i.e. serial matched).""  

You reap what you sow.  There is a difference between protecting your IP and helping customers keep their products running.  It is a sad day that farmers are running to the government JUST SO THAT THEY CAN REPAIR THEIR OWN SHIT.  ""Sorry, that part isn't supported, even though we COULD support it, but instead of doing that, we'll just gouge and force you to buy a brand new UPDATED version of the same part, which we will support until we no longer will.""  

The thing is, I HATE adding government regulations, but I would support them if they are for the purpose of allowing customers the ability to maintain what they purchased and not be forced to go through a hyper-expensive dealer for simple repairs.

As for why Apple showed up, it is because THEY DO THE SAME THING.  Check out this video by Louis Rossmann (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVAmnV65_zw).  He is from New York City and runs a computer repair shop, but he specializes in repairing motherboards themselves.  In real time, he demonstrates how an issue with a customer's motherboard results in a vague diagnostic code.  This code must be fixed through an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Dealer.  The standard operating procedure for these particular error codes is to replace the entire motherboard ($750, regardless of how old your Macbook is).  The truth is that they could easily repair just the problematic chip or sensor on the motherboard, but they don't offer this because they know it doesn't make them a killing.  Louis Rossmann repairs these issues just fine and it doesn't take long.  

So, Apple showed up at this Right to Repair hearing because instead of them creating a system by which they themselves offer repairs at reasonable prices, or allow third parties the diagnostic tools to do the repairs on behalf of the customer, they instead want to protect their proprietary DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS.  We aren't even talking about the source code of the iPhone/Macbook, but simply access to DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS.  

Shame on Apple and Microsoft and John Deere and any other manufacturer who doesn't put profits over customers, but puts reason and what is right over them.  I have no issue with companies making big profits, but they must not lose sight of the fact that customers are their life blood.  John Deere has a HUGE market share in farming equipment and that is all they are trying to protect, even though I'd imagine that these same farmers would gladly use John Deere's services if they were reasonable and not this ""Nope, you can't use a second hand part and Nope you have to buy a new one because we say so"" garbage.",0.8587,605

"One of their biggest complaints I know of from people I associate with that do BTO farming is fuel consumption and realistic service life (Or rather gross lack thereof) of their machines due to emission compliance to which on their last round of Tier 3 compliant tractors and combines their 'chipped' units all picked up 10 - 15+% fuel efficiency plus substantial power while at the same time having oil and like fluid  test numbers at normal service interval come back way better as well.  

When your burning several hundred gallons of fuel a day per machine cutting 10 +15+ percent of your fuel use down while gaining 5 - 10+% more crop throughput due to having the power to run more efficiently is well worth a few thousand dollars.   

Even more so if it keeps you from having to pay out $1K - $3+K on pointless service calls and days of downtime out of one season because an emission system related fault took a machine down.  

Then even more if you are a long term machine owner who does trade off every year (just to keep the full factory warranty in effect) and for having done such a  black market retune gives you 20 - 50+ % more engine service life before it blows up and costs you $50 - $100K+ to replace right in the middle of harvest someday.    

Not too hard to justify a $1000 - $2000+ blackmarket retune if it can save  you a $100+K on a single machine in its dismal 10 year expected service lifetime because lack of dealer parts and service support will force you to scrap it at that time.",0.7264,309

"You need to skip the State gov and go to the Federal Gov and members of Congress... This was settled with Cars and Trucks in the 80's or early 90's... When computers came out on cars and light trucks each one had there own codes for diagnosis and connectors to hook to the car...  The Federal Gov. Regulators made them all, foreign and domestic, conform to one same connector and same codes...  I can't believe the same laws do not apply to Equipment of any kind now that the Federal Government has mandated new emission standards for off-road equipment... In fact, last I knew the Auto manufactures worked with aftermarket providers of software and manuals to get it right... I cannot believe the Gov would not make them follow the same laws as other manufactures of any kind of vehicle or equipment... You should defiantly call you Federal reps and inquire into the situation.... I was a mechanic on cars and trucks back then and believe me I know your nightmare in not having access to the latest software... We also spent lots of money out of our pockets to buy every little adapter and books and software for the new vehicles just to figure out how to tune them up and make sure all the sensors worked right to pass emissions... I am not saying it was cheap as Snap-on Tools had a computer that hooked up to most with all the adapters and it was over $2000.00 back then and each cartridge was 300-400 dollars for each domestic manufacture and then foreign companies also...  But they had to have gotten the info from some one or written there own.. I went to GM training schools and they told me that companies like Snap-on and other aftermarket companies wrote down  the same info the vehicle manufactures had as they wrote in in there tech books....  Is this a problem with John Deere only or does CAT and CASE and Mahindra do the same thing ????    
Like I said, since this equipment has to pass Federal gov emission standards and should have to be kept up to those standards, I cannot believe that they do not have to  provide there info to owners to keep them that way...  If this is a John Deere problem only, I would still go to the feds as you the Taxpayer have invested your money in the equipment and when it is broke down, it, as your tools of the trade and your investment becomes useless... Of course if they are the only ones, then buy elsewhere... 
As far as why the Computer companies showed up is because they have everyone snowed that they are the only ones that can work on there precious equipment and software.... As far as software goes, if you look hard enough you can get around Microsoft operating systems and all there other programs with a lot of free applications....  Del loves to make there computers to where you need there parts for replacement, but you can switch a lot of them.. Those Companies don't want to lose there business either..  The others all tell you that you can't use aftermarket parts, but most parts interchange and will work fine...  
I don't know if it is lack of demand right now for the John Deere Software because most of it is under warranty still, I know we ran into that for a period of time with the vehicles, there was nothing much more we could say but take it to the dealer, but seemed like as soon as the warranties ran out they brought it all to us and parts and software became available the minute somebody smelled they could make a buck...
Let me make myself clear, I am not saying anything bad about any company in this situation, as all have got to make money as they see fit, I am saying that there ought to be laws that would cover this situation and most likely are on the books already...  Like one is as far as I know, and I am not a lawyer or expert, however, I think that copyright laws would apply to any material that is older than 7 years of age... After that there ownership should be terminated and open up to anyone's use and or reproduction... But I am sure that is all up to the lawyers and those with the deepest pockets....   
I have subscribed and hope you will make other vidio's related to this subject....  I live in Oklahoma and will look into the situation as I can... Something smells rotten to me...",0.9782,832
