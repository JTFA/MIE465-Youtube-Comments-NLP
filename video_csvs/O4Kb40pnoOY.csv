"Is the main plot of the story the fact that the parents are killing their kids because of some widespread epidemic that only affects those who have procreated? Or is it some psychological tendency among the parents of that area? What I'm getting from this trailer is that the parents are just ultimately sick of their kid's shit lives and exact revenge because... kids suck? If the kids were 18 and considered adults, would the parents still go after them? If so, then why aren't the grandparents immediately coming to the parents house to murder their kids now turned parents? This would then go back to the question of whether or not this movie uses the plot line of epidemic or mass psychological tendency, but that's just speculation. Even so, I want to watch this movie because, of course, Nic Cage is in here, but also because I love how to see how it pans out and tries to explain itself.
