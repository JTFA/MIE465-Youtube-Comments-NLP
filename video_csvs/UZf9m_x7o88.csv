"(False Teachers; Heretics; Wolves in Sheep's Clothing):

For certain men have crept in unnoticed,
who long ago 
were marked out 
for this condemnation,
ungodly men,
who turn the grace of our God
into lewdness
and deny the only Lord God
and our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Jude 1:4).

***The Heretics were subtle. Their primary tactics were to pervert God's grace and to deny the authority of the Lord. (Proverbs 1:29)<---Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD.

***They were clever enough to have infiltrated the Christian community, even though they were ungodly. Jesus anticipated this kind of people when He spoke about wolves in sheep's clothing. (Matthew 7:15)<---Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

***(Turn the grace of our God into lewdness): The teaching of grace can be dangerous when perverted by false teachers or carnal people who believe that because they have been saved by grace they may live as they please. (Romans 6:1-2)<---What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

***(The only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ): These false teachers not only lived immorally, they rejected the authority of Christ. The first Greek word translated Lord here means ""Master."" It identifies one who possesses absolute power and thus commands obedience. In the original wording it is clear that the entire statement refers to Christ: Jesus is both our absolute Sovereign and our God.
(False Teachers in the Church):
Likewise also
these filthy dreamers
defile the flesh,
despise authority,
and speak evil of dignities.

(Jude 1:8).

***The false teachers were arrogant and had their own agenda. They had not been commissioned by the church nor called by the Holy Spirit.

***Jude calls these ungodly persons dreamers, perhaps because they claimed divine revelation, but more likely because they denied the Lord and thus were living in an unreal world of deception. They were creating their own false world in which indulging in immorality went hand in hand with salvation.

***(Reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries): The false teachers even rejected those who were placed in positions of authority in local congregations. They not only preferred error to truth but also demeaned and rejected those who taught the truth.

(More on False Teachers):

But these speak evil
of those things
which they know not:
but what they know naturally,
as brute beasts,
in those things
they corrupt themselves.

(Jude 1:10).

***The false teachers do not know the truth of the gospel. They speak on matters that they don not understand, as natural people and not as spiritual people.

***(1 Corinthians 2:14)<---But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

***They have understanding not of the Spirit of God, but only of what they share in common with the animal world, things far less than God's intent for His human creatures.

(Apostates/False Teachers; Depraved and Doomed):

These are spots in your love feasts, 

(Spots in you love feasts): The people of God had been deceived by people who appeared to be messengers of God but instead were ministers of SATAN. (2 Corinthians 11:4)<---For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear this beautifully. (2 Corinthians 11:13-15)<--For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds). The Greek word of spots may also be translated ""hidden reefs"": It serves as a strong warning to be on guard against deceivers!). 

while they feast with you 
without fear, 

serving only themselves. 

They are clouds without water, 
carried about by the winds; 

late autumn trees without fruit, 

(Clouds without water...trees without fruit): Clouds may look like they will bring rain until the winds blows them away. (Proverbs 25:14)<---Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain). Trees may look productive until autumn arrives, the time for fruit to be picked. The ministers of Satan promise spiritual growth but do not satisfy the hunger of God's people for the truth. They talk about God but are truly godless). 

twice dead, 
pulled up by the roots;

Raging waves of the sea, 
foaming up their own shame; 

wandering stars, 

(Raging waves...foaming...wandering stars): These godless people put on a great show but lacked any substance. They boasted of liberty but placed the people of God in bondage to ""SIN!"" (2 Peter 2:19)<---They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corruption. For a man is a slave to whatever has overcome him). After they had done their evil deeds and made their profits, they, like wandering stars, moves on to other places to exploit God's people again). 

for whom is reserved 
the blackness of darkness 
forever. 

(Darkness forever): These deceivers might not be punished for their evil deeds in this world, and their true character and deeds might fail to be discovered by Christians, but their punishment is certain!). 

(Jude 1:12-13).
 _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
(Apostates Predicted/False teachers corrupting the congregation from within, that the apostles of Jesus warned us about, according to the book of Jude): 

These are grumblers, complainers, 

(Grumblers, Complainers): This verse describes various ways evil people misuse their tongues. Instead of praising God, they boast; instead of encouraging, they whine and complain. their lives are characterized by intense selfishness and a slavery to personal desires. By using flattering words, they try to gain a following for themselves that opposes the proper authorities in local congregations). 

walking according to their own lusts; 

and they mouth great swelling words, 

flattering people to gain advantage. 

But you, 
beloved, 

remember the words 
which were spoken before 
by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: 

(The words of the apostles are important because they express the will of God. In discerning the spirit in verse 19 of anyone claiming to speak for God, the only sure standard for evaluation is the bible. Those who attack the central truths of Scripture, the ones concerning God, Christ, and salvation by God's grace through faith, must be avoided). 

how they told you that 

there would be mockers in the last days 
who would walk according 
to their own ungodly lusts. 

(Jude points out that nothing that has been observed about the false teachers should have taken the believers by surprise. The apostles had given warning that in the end times evil deceivers would come among them. The description of the heretics as mockers indicates that one of their main tactics to gain credibility was to tear down godly leaders). 

These are sensual persons, 
who cause divisions, 
not having the Spirit.<------(No HOLY SPIRIT!). (Heb 1:9). 

(When Jude declares that the false teachers are without the SPIRIT, he leaves no doubt as to their eternal destiny. They are merely worldly persons and do not belong to God!). 

***(Romans 8:14)<---For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God). 

***(Romans 8:9)<---But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his).

***(Acts 5:32)<---And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the (((Holy Ghost))), whom God hath given to them that (((obey him))).

Major prophecy is being fulfilled as I type this and you read this comment, and watch this video.

Only because of The Lord's Mercy we are able to see all these things slowly reaching its pinnacle!

If you do not know The Lord Jesus, I HIGHLY suggest you make Jesus Lord of your life today! Tomorrow is not promised, let alone the next hour. You do not need a fancy prayer, all you need is your heart, some faith and a simple confession on how you need Jesus.

Repent of your sins and put your faith in Him.

The Lord is not angry at you. HE LOVES YOU! HE LOVES US ALL! Hallelujah!
Come as you are to Him, and allow Him to wash you and make you new. This is all I did, and I have been delivered from all my sins and bonds.
Thank You, Jesus!

I pray you make today the day to call upon Jesus in truth, because you will be saved, and escape the oncoming judgement. Jesus made a WAY back to The Father, and that is through Him, since He took our punishment on the cross already. Hallelujah! Be exalted, Lord Jesus!!!

Something is up with this fire. I live in colorado springs and we have had our share of wildfires burn through neighborhoods and when the fire rolls through it isn't anything like this bullshit! You don't get to watch your house burn from the street! Reporters and residents are evacuated. These fires in my opinion appear to be staged. When neighborhoods start going up it looks totally different than this. You don't get to see your house burn unless there is a news chopper nearby to film it and you see it on tv. No reporters in active areas. PERIOD! When neighborhoods were burning down here the firefighter presence was everywhere. They were saving every home they could. Knocking down flames off houses literally. Only homes that made it were stucco homes with metal or tile roofs that had landscaped yards that had fire mitigation as the main focus. There weren't many standing homes in the first couple blocks of the fires path into the city. It took a 4 lane road with a median and countless firefighters to protect the other side to get a handle on it. Btw we had almost a week fighting that fire already before it blew into the city so there were the best wildfire and firefighter teams from around the country already in place and still massive loss of property. Many more saved. Skip to next year. Fire starts just north of the city in the town of Black Forest. Houses start burning within half an hour. 3 days later 95% of Black Forest is destroyed!

"Winter begins Dec 21. We have been in a drought, this has been a very warm/dry Fall so far, and we get seasonal high winds twice a year. I had heard that campfire embers kicked up by the high winds may have been the culprit of the Thomas fire (not sure about the causes for the Rye and Creek fires). Red flag warnings were issued before the winds hit, the winds were especially strong at the beginning of the week and are not expected to die down until Friday.",0.664,100

[GD] Phantom X ALT Hello from Oxnard :D hopefully your house didn't burn down. The wind's changing direction and the smoke started coming over here. Hopefully it's only the smoke and the fire doesn't get here with it.,0.7925,43
[GD] Phantom X ALT look all I'm saying is that when we had our wildfires here the only footage of in the active fire zone came from firefighters on the ground and from helicopters in the sky. All reporters and residents were outside of the mandatory evacuation zone. Im not saying the fire is fake. Real flames are burning homes. All i know is this isn't how the wildfire emergency action playbook works. You don't get to go back in a burned neighborhood while the coals are still hot. Much less while it is still on fire! I'll link a video here in a min. Government handles all wildfires the same way. Across the country. I'm sure by now the feds have been in charge and hotshot crews are in charge. Colorado Springs has deployed a few trucks to help on this fire and others in the area. So yeah fire real... also real danger too! Ive seen wind blow a fucking firestorm through neighborhoods and whole communities to devastating effect. The rules are being broken here tho for some reason tho. Hmm.,-0.9558,202

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
