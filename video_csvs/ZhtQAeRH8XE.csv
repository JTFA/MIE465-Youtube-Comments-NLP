"+Sara Dietschy Great video as usual! Congrats on the new Shure SM7B. It's a great mic. For what it's worth, I originally paired mine up with a CloudLifter but had a better experience with the dbx286s. The Cloudlifter was picking up a local radio station and embedding its signal in my noise floor. Couldn't get rid of it no matter what I did. Even tried a different CloudLifter and hook-up cables. You may not have this issue, but if you do encounter it and are looking for an alternative amp that can drive the hungry SM7B. The dbx is the way to go.",0.8497,116

Throw in two multi-TB drives in RAID-0 for a very nice (but not as nice as SSD speed) project/render drive. I work solely with SSD in my desktop and laptop,  and have a 40TB NAS setup over 1Gbps network, but its too slow for larger 4K source material (I do sports videography with 4K camera and DNxHR format.. 300GB an hour). My new Threadripper system doesnt have Thunderbolt 3 (yet.. supposedly will soon) but I wanted something I could use for larger files and renders with decent speed.. so 2 HDs in RAID 0 over a 10Gbps USB-C does the job nicely at a very affordable price.",-0.4756,163

Everyone says RAIDs are the best bc they are sold on the idea of redunancy.  But myself counter is what happens to your data when redunancy fails?¬†

RAID types are a standard but the implementation of how an RAID writes data to a drive varies from company to company. ¬†So when it fails, ¬†you are stuck calling that company to recover your data. ¬†They have locked u into thier ecosystem and can and wil charge you whatever they like to attempt to recover your data.

how do u backup the data you have stored on the NAS?
