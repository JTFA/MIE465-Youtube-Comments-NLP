How green, how green was my valley?
To be told of such hills
To be held in such spots
To behold such warmth
Call to arms these harmonies!
And in happy agony we sing
How green, how green was my valley?

How green, how green was my valley?

Oh, your deeps and your shades
Where the wild roses pray
Such heat from pride
Glorious, the voice of man!
Like the nightingales, we sing

How green, how green was my valley?

Clear softness in our hymn
Soft, like coming rain
Soft, like Bronwen
Victoria! Victoria!
Voices our queen might envy

"The novel that this video/song is based off of loosely. Obviously not a literal adaptation, but you can generally see the broad strokes. Particularly with the ending of the novel, and the loss of everyone and the mining town:

The novel is set in South Wales during the reign of Queen Victoria. It tells the story of the Morgans, a respectable mining family of the South Wales Valleys, through the eyes of one of the sons, Huw Morgan.
Huw's academic ability sets him apart from his elder brothers and enables him to consider a future away from the dangerous coal mines. His five brothers and his father are miners. After his eldest brother, Ivor, is killed in a mining accident, Huw moves in with his sister-in-law, Bronwen, with whom he has always been in love.
One of Huw's three sisters, Angharad, marries the wealthy mine owner's son – whom she does not love – and the marriage is an unhappy one. She never overcomes her clandestine relationship with the local minister.
Huw's father is later killed in a mine explosion. After everyone Huw has known either dies or moves away, and the town is reduced to a contaminated shell, he decides to leave, and tells the story of his life just before going away.",-0.1406,243
"The song is based on Richard Llewelyn's 1939 novel How Green Was My Valley?, about a small mining community in 19th-century Wales.
The video is an epic short film, inspired both by the song's source material and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice. A family must pit their desire to have a child against the knowledge that this would destroy their community. The hypnotic, hymnal quality of the song binds the video throughout, hinting at redemption while destruction takes place.",0.0,88

"This is not your regular music video – it's a six-minute, miniature epic inspired by ""Pleader,"" the closing cut on alt-J's album Relaxer.




The song itself is inspired by Richard Llewelyn's book How Green Was My Valley, a story set in 19th century Wales in a small mining town, in part about a family that hopes its youngest son will find a better life. The song by alt-J is grand, too, recorded in a cathedral with an organ, a boys choir (alt-J keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton was a member of this choir as a child) and the London Metropolitan Orchestra.




Joe Newman, alt-J singer and guitarist, wrote me saying, ""When we set out to make a video for 'Pleader', [I] sent the following one-line brief to director, Isaiah Seret: 'A Welsh mining love story; A tidal wave of earth.' What Isaiah came back with was an epic short-film inspired both by the song's source material and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice. A family must pit their desire to have a child against the knowledge that this would destroy their community. The hypnotic, hymnal quality of the song binds the video throughout, hinting at redemption while destruction takes place.""
The film does what alt-J does best, mixing folktale and imagination to create a world of characters who are thought-provoking and intriguing.
