"Good question! There are a few different routes here. First, faucet is a vague category. It could be your kitchen sink, shower/bath, or your outdoor spigots. For some, you don't need remote access.¬†They are convenient for when you are in your home. That is where the sink and bath/shower fit.¬†


When you get out of the bed in the morning you can say ""Siri turn on the shower"" and she will turn it on a warm it up. Or while you are cooking, you can throw a stock pot under the faucet at say ""Siri dispense 3 quarts of water"" and go on with the rest of your cooking while the water comes out.¬†Lastly, you can control temperature. So you can set the tub to an appropriate temperature to give you kid a bath, and not worry about scalding them.



As far as remote access is concerned,  outdoor control is where it's at. If you regularly;y water your lawn, you can use a HomeKit controller to automate your lawn care. Have it turn the sprinklers on each night at 3 am, whether or not you are at home, or a business trip. Similarly, if you are out of town and notice it has been dry, just ask Siri to water your garden for you, so none of your flowers die. 


Hope this is able to answer some of your question!",0.8776,272
"Great video, good journalism, and horrible b-roll... camera is way too zoomed in everywhere",0.5423,17
"Hey guys! Nice summary but you did unfortunately miss out that Somfy will release the Somfy Outdoor Camera this year with support for HomeKit. Also, the smart hub, Somfy TaHoma will get support for HomeKit giving lots of more possibilities for the smart home!",0.9411,49
"Hi! I live in an apartment! In fact, this is the third apartment I've lived in where they are totally fine with me replacing the outlets & switches. I asked the leasing office ahead of time, and as long as I reverted it back when I left, they had no qualms. Replacing an outlet/switch is super easy to do and only takes a few minutes.",0.8062,75
I disagree with you for ppl like me (who stay in apartments /condos) the outlets that go into the standard outlet is actually very nice a lot of ppl are owning homes LESS,0.4576,36
"I got 30 of the Nanoleaf aurora panels, and I would love the square panels to fill up my wall, create pixel air and  if someone is smart and good with coding, maybe create pixels games on the wall if the api is available",0.9186,47
"I think ‚Äúneed‚Äù is too strong. But it is certainly nice to have. If you have kids, you have to worry about the water being too hot or cold. If you live with others, you can have your own lighting/music/temperature scene for the bathroom where all those are adjusted together. There are plenty of reasons it could be nice.",0.8126,72
I wonder if it will work with Arlo pro cams also.,0.0,12

Nice video. I've been wanting to purchase the Koogeek light stip for a few weeks but it doesn't seem to be available for purchase. Any idea on when it will be available?,0.2263,35
"Not, I haven't even been able to get a press version. They sold through their initial stock. Hopefully it will be shipping soon!",0.4574,27
"Oh no! I'm sorry about that! I'll put it in the description! If you want, send an email to andrew@idownloadblog.com and we will look at making sure you are on our HomeKit list!",0.3111,38
"Ok, I get why people need HomeKit for security cameras, lighting, heating, etc when they are out of the home but I have to question the need for faucet control???",0.4291,37

"Wemo Bridge doesn't support Wemo Maker... the only reason I still use Wemo! No other company makes a similar - and ridiculously versatile - device. As soon as they do, I'm ditching Wemo entirely. I'm sick of their nonsense. Their slow HomeKit support has meant I've moved all existing Wemo devices to Elgato's devices instead. And their customer support is much better.",-0.9193,70

anyone else but you? I think your the only employee at IDB (in da butt?),0.0,19
iDB Seems a bit too much for me but to each their own. It‚Äôs your money. And I would worry about trusting the Siri application to keep the water from scalding the kids.,-0.0772,38
