"For the Q/A:
You've made a few different ground vehicles now, will you ever attempt a flying one? A quadcopter/drone would be easy enough as long as you understand the electronics behind it, designing a 3D printed airplane from scratch would be really cool to see, and making a working 3d-printed helicopter (it IS possible) would be absolutely amazing.",0.862,73
GRANDE IVAN!!!,0.0,5
"GREAT JOB! Great job all the way around, I knew if you stuck with it you'd get it to work and work well and with your editing you turned it into a fantastic project.
Just think what it could do if you made your drive ""wheels"" bigger, maybe a little longer but larger diameter also. Would have to print them in quarter sections then glue them together, if you try making them hollow with longer ""vanes"" for a better bit, waterproof everything bet it would float and move well.

Nice job. I would suggest you rotate the two gearboxes outward to maximize your ground clearance. At 6:43 it looks like they are really close to the ground. I was going to suggest just printing a bolt on adapter to accept the wooden rods in a new position but it probably wouldn't take much more to just change the design of the gear box and print new ones.,0.5346,72

Very nice job!  The Russians had a number of rigs that tested the auger drive system.  The earliest auger drive that I know of was the auger drive for the Fordson tractor.  I forget what they called it.  Both used a finer pitch than what you are using on your augers.   One was a double helix and the Fordson was triple helix as I remember.   I know there are videos out there of both of them... likely that is where you got the idea.  Now are you going to scale it up?,0.4186,101

"well done, i though move the gear boxes higher, seal them and have a final drive shaft  to the screw's less parts to get dirt into.
also all electronics and battery in a sealed box's, protect from elements (water) perhaps. Wire are cheap and you will loose  nothing power wise with longer cable runs, but have protected components. 
If you make functional items modular you could end up with 'lego' like components that just clip together , different screw assemblies, electronic boxes (control batt etc) then upgrades are easer more power more batt boxes etc
