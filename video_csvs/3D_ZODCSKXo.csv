I want DCEU to be more dark and mature, because I'm also sick and tired of this trend that's going on right now; superhero movies need to be fun, hilarious, jokey, not taking itself seriously etc. Don't get me wrong...

The Reason Iron Man stood out so much was mostly for the tone. It was the perfect tone that people didn't know they wanted. It was grounded, yet fun.

Now they are bringing all these directors that don't have his same vision thus the tonal clash. They need to find a way to reboot and find what audiences grip on to. Make a fun movie with dark tones like wonder women. Take it slow, find directors that have a clear vision with a coherent tone that will blend with the rest of the DCEU.

"The only thing is Flashpoint CAN'T be a comedy. This isn't like him in Justice League or anywhere else. It has to be serious. It has to be dark. Wonder Woman and Aquaman are evil and fighting each other. Superman was never known to man and is a science experiment. Then Bruce Wayne died and Thomas Wayne is an even darker Batman. Yes there can be some occasional puns but it can't be no where near the comedy in something like Thor Ragnarok was. Which should've been a much more serious movie.

Honestly I was hoping they might go with somebody with a variety of experience as Writer, Producer and Director across scary movies, the hero genre, and much more. Somebody like Drew Goddard who did some stunning work with Daredevil(yes the good Netflix one), Cabin in the Woods, The Martian. He's written with Joss Whedon too.",0.9336,167

"The problem is that if this is supposed to be a cinematic universe, then you can't make it all dark... especially when most of DC's characters are very hopeful characters. If this was DC Vertigo, then sure, make it dark... but this is DC proper. The only reason it's dark is because it was built off of Man of Steel which was conceptualized as a stand-alone trilogy equivalent to the Nolan Batman trilogy... then Avengers came out and DC panicked and decided to build off of MoS to save time, gave it all to Snyder, and decided to turn the dark tone into a PR spin of ""our universe is going to be dark because that makes it unique"".
You can't make a dark Green Lantern that won't come across as campy. Out of all the JL, Batman is the only Dark one.",0.3392,159

"This is the problem with a lot of people that consider themselves DC fans. They think that DC always has to be dark 100% of the time and that they should be completely different from Marvel in that regard. I couldn’t disagree more with that. The only time DC movies or comics should be dark is if they fit the particular character that the movie or comic is about or if they’re adapting a certain story for that character that happens to be dark. For example, properties like Batman, Jonah Hex, Justice League Dark, etc should have dark tones to their movies and comics. But characters like Flash, Plastic Man, Booster Gold, Blue Beetle, Shazam, etc should be light in tone. While Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Superman, etc should be more balanced. And it’s the same thing with Marvel. Characters like Ant Man, Spider-Man, Thor to a lesser degree, and others like them have lighter tones while Cap and Iron Man’s movies are pretty balanced for the most part. And Marvel has their fair share of dark characters too like Moon Knight, Ghost Rider, Blade, Daredevil, and fucking PUNISHER. So stop using the old tired stigma of DC=Dark & Grim and Marvel=Light & Comedic. If you think that DC is only dark and that their movies should all be dark then, I hate to break it to you, but you’re not a true DC fan. I understand making these movies feel different than Marvel’s films for variety sake, but that’s not the answer. And I’m also on the side of thinking that the dark tone isn’t the problem with MoS and BvS (I actually like MoS). It’s the writing and execution of the stories. But about the Flashpoint story, I think it’d be a mistake to make this movie comedic (if that’s what they’re doing), because of the darkness of the comic story and animated movie. But if they can change the story up and still make it work like Taika Watiti did with Ragnarok, then we’ll be okay. But they could also not actually be going the comedic route like people think and could end up just being the right guys for the job. Because remember, the Russo Bros did Community but then also later did Winter Soldier (The darkest and most serious MCU movie to date). So nothing’s impossible.",0.7117,477

This trailer plays right into the shitty high brow movie critic drama oscar crap that's sidelined good genre film for years now. Why, when we see a slightly off centre quirky character with a disability, or impediment or strange intricacy along with a weird hair style and high drama, do we immediately start thinking oscars.

"flash is the more comedic character in the dc-verse, right? the show has humor in it, not all the time but enough. not seen vacation.
let´s hope they stay true to the chartacter. homecoming´s great :), felt true to spiderman. superman´s not dark, flash´s not dark.
batman´s dark though. just stay true to the characters. dc may be a darker universe but not all characters are dark. still not that
interested in the dceu after the whole mess with jl and before...

i´m exited for solo still :). wait with marketing and save money! trailer to be released 1 month before :). i want a movie per character! 
i want it! make it happen  :). where´s the young leia rebel movie... the actor who played cgi leia in rogue one looks like leia! save the 
leia character please!!! recast her in ep 9! dame judi dench looks like a strong leia. since they´re craming solo saving chewie into this, 
will they have a good relationship from the start or will chewie warm up to solo eventually? i hope it´s set as close as possible to 3 to 
allow for sequels. solo will make several 100´s of millions, don´t worry. fett could make a cameo ;). is it a race or a smuggling run? 
the kessel run.

didn't phoenix beat liv tyler? just saying, about the witch hunt harassment thing today.

that´s right schnepp, focus on doing good movies and don´t worry about useless f#¤%ng awards. it´s not more important to get one over  on
each other.

wasp and ant-man looking good :).

is lonsdale a good actor? thinking that his flash character felt/feels gay-ish after he came out as gay/bisexual... 
or is the character gay too? just wondering really, touchy subject for some perhaps but i´m just wondering about his acting skillz.

all 3 og star wars :). brazil would be nice. all mad max would be sweet :). always forget that the 1st is before the apocalypse...
pulp fiction, i´d see that in theaters. lord of the rings is awesome. i saw abyss in a theater that shows older movies :), saw rabid
in the same theater. a film school theater thing where you can buy tickets. no pre seating in that theater though like the rest but not 
a lot of people go. ryan and jurassic are great, when they approach the island in the chopper it´s hard not to cry of joy and nostalgia. 
never ending story :)... hair? akira or ghost in the shell perhaps. tim burtons batman. wrath of khan.

jay you could watch full monty if you like to laugh to men dancing :). carlyle!
