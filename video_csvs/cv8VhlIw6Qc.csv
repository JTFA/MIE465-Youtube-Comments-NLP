"LOL No democrat support...Citing not enough help to individual taxpayers. Funny, because they had 8 years and a super majority to make such a bill, and instead did corporate bail outs and nationalized a major corporation at tax payer expense, as well as bailing out banks, and didn't even consider the American public during that time. You'll never get a tax cut from democrats. Never. Just bigger government, and the means to run it which comes out of your wallet.",0.8686,92

"Republicans have increased the deficit more than Democrats since and including Ronald Reagan. Interest is paid yearly to service the national debt. The more paid in interest , the less the government has for all of it's expenditures. The tax cuts are a gift to Republican campaign donors, and should give a nice boost to Republican campaigns in the mid terms, and beyond. The deficit is over twenty trillion dollars today. In ten years the deficit will be over thirty five trillion dollars. The government will have to borrow one and one half trillion to pay for the tax cuts. The tax cuts for the middle class will expire in a few years. The tax cuts for large corporations and the wealthy will continue. Tax cuts with out spending cuts were tried under George Bush. The growth to the economy was overshadowed by the increase to the deficit. The tax cuts did not work. Proof is our soaring debt.",-0.6637,174

Yeah Chuck Schumer said it was a disgrace it's a disgrace to get people tax breaks. That don't make any sense. Tax break is always good why should the government have their hands in your pocket for real. The corporate tax cut is so they can compete in the world. Child tax credit who can be against that. Nancy Pelosi? The Democrats better get rid of their old people. Why the other Democrats don't  vote for this bill who are they scared of in their own party? Where are the independent mines at at least there were some Republicans I think 12 at one time voted against it there are some independent people in the Republican party. The Republicans want to give the money back to the working people and then Democrats want to give it to the people that don't work through your taxes. That's the big difference.,0.6767,160

"can you explain to me why the democrats pay people to stay at home that are to lazy to work? I think you will find it is for a vote but the problem is 90% of democrats are still in poverty, road are not going away, more people will be working adding more money to the taxes and USA can get some of the jobs back they lost through Obama, Obamacare fine has to go to that is 100% against the constitution.",-0.8934,89
