"Alexandra Rosenstein Thats a video about girls under 21 that are doing great things in life. Some of them happen to be muslims. Get over it. The fact that you'd say something like that shows that for some reason you're so surprised that muslim girls are being represented that you automatically think that they've been including in this video for ""diversity"" purpose. Maybe they're just smart and deserve to be in it? Have you thought about that ?",0.9032,85

"Catherine Dompierre I have checked my privilege. I am very lucky to live in a way I do, not every guy is appreciated. I am a feminist, I appreciate that many women around the world are not appreciated but not every guy is, equal representation would be nice. Not every guys is accepted in every field. So many LGBTQ+ guys are discriminates. Please check your facts x
P.s. I am a girl x",0.9455,85
"Catherine Dompierre I see your point. But I have not defined them by their sexuality, I was simply just giving an example of men who don't have everything handed to them on a plate üòä. Thank you for being able to have a mature and civilised discussion, it's quite refreshing to see in the comments section! Some people should take note üòä Also I do respect their decision to feature all women, I think it was much needed. Just would be nice to see some men in their too, teen vogue seem to focus quite solely on women who make a difference, not just in this video but a few. I know it is because their target demographic is girls/women but would be nice to see both promoted xx",0.9324,141
