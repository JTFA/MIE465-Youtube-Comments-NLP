Boosters that are going to be recovered are heavier than expendable boosters because they have to be fitted with grid fins and landing struts. Also a percentage of the propellant must be conserved to perform the required burns to facilitate a successful landing. 

Bottom line, an expedable booster can carry a heavier payload into LEO, or carry a payload into a higher orbit. So the weight of the payload and the altitude of the required orbit determine whether a booster can be landed close to the launch site on land, on a drone ship hundreds of miles away, or is just discarded.",0.34,112

   Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) died prior to the invention of the Telescope.

1610
Galileo Galilei, claims to see Spaceballs orbiting about one another.
   Galileo is a beneficiary of the Jesuit payroll.

*1611*
Christopher Clavius, a Jesuit at the Collegio Romano, confirms Galileo‚Äôs observations of planetary motion.
   Jesuits claim that Lights they observe through their Telescopes are in fact Spaceballs that orbit about one another.

*The reader will note, that from this point on ""verifiable reality"" has been replaced with Theoretical Math Equations (pretend).*

1687 
Sir Isaac Newton, invents the theory of Gravity establishing a friction-less environment required for Spaceballs to orbit about one another.

1798
Sir Henry Cavendish invents the MASS of the Earth and the Mass for all other Spaceballs. He was the first to calculate the gravitational constant [G], showing how Spaceballs orbit about one another in the vacuum of space.

"The easy way to eliminate gravity  just spinning  #FeelFree 

There is two kinds of vehicle what was in generaly used by human being in the life history in the world, there is: using momentum force like animal, car, airoplane or ship: The other using centrifugal force like flying saucer. The concerned animal is horse, camel, donkey, etcetera. And the flying obyect is all kinds of vehicle realized by human being technology included flying saucer.

Earth which weight predict 600 trillion ton does not fall at the Sun because of centrifugal in orbitting, on the contrary it does not be thrown far go out the orbit line of hold by gravity at the Sun as orbit center. Gravity and centrifugal is equal called Equillibrium, thats why until now Earth which we was inhabited always rotate and circulate the Sun. Now we justly take example : how if the gravity used and centrifugal is negated? The Earth will float far leave the Sun. So that centrifugal can be used to fly far away if gravity eliminated. Finally how to eliminate gravity?


It‚Äôs way rotate part of aircraft by horizontal. When that rotation faster centrifugal force getting greater and the gravity getting smaller, finally it lose the gravity and the aircraft start flying. Of course people would surprise: how the aircraft can keep rotate without fulcrums? Thats why we named that aircraft Shuttling System that is aircraft likes two disc adjoining attached in the midle as fulcrums:


A. The Top part, we name Positive rotate to right, and the edges is getting thicker and havier.
B. The Buttom part, we name Negative rotating to left, and the edges is getting thicker and havier.
C. Middle Part , we name Neutral, air crew placed and also machine and everythings turning Negative and Positive at the same time.

The aircraft can liftup added with explosion from the engine. However that aircraft construction later, let the engineer doit it, and we are sure the aircraft will bulletproof and also waterproof.",0.9305,376

"Your loving Saviour, Jesus Christ:  Humility necessary to enter Heaven.
  -Friday, April 29th, 2011 @ 15:15

My dearly beloved daughter, humility is a lesson, which all those who wish to enter My Kingdom must learn.

Humility declares your littleness in My Eyes where you revere Me, your Saviour, the Son of God made man. Without it pride gets in the way. That is of no use if you want to declare yourself fit for My Kingdom.

In today‚Äôs world humility is not acceptable, in an era where assertiveness and a desire to succeed in bettering yourselves, ahead of others, is deemed an admirable trait. Those who do not exalt themselves or push ahead with confidence and arrogance in the world are ignored. 
Their trait of humility and generosity towards others is considered a weakness ‚Äì they are not worth bothering about to be included in their company. Yet the opposite virtue to pride is the key to entering the Kingdom of Heaven. So what is considered to be a successful approach to developing the key to wealth and riches in this life is precisely the formula that will lead you to darkness after death.

Humility, where you accept that you must serve your Maker and Creator first, is what is truly important. By declaring your nothingness you proclaim the Glory of God.

Humility is a virtue, which is not only precious in My Eyes, but which is an important part of your spiritual development. It means placing others before yourself for the Glory of God. Yet it is so easy to fall into a state of pride so quickly.

 Warning to chosen souls.

Take those who have worked hard to develop their spiritual lives to please Me. Then consider those fortunate souls who have been given Gifts, where, through the Power of the Holy Spirit, act as visionaries in the world. 
Very often, having attained these graces, they subtly begin to consider themselves to be more special than their brothers or sisters. They boast of the Gifts they possess. Then they become selective as to how they share these Gifts. 

Their self-glory then affects their ability to impart the Truth. What they have forgotten is that all the Gifts they are given come from Me. I love everyone. They are given these Gifts to share. Just as I give these Gifts to such chosen souls for the good of others, so too, can I take them away.

Self-glory prevents you from truly following My steps. Learn to be humble, patient and devoid of pride. If you work towards humility, you will be given a special place in My Heart. While I select certain people as chosen souls, they should consider this a Gift. 
They must never think they are more important in My Eyes, because I love everyone. Yet I will reward good work once humility is shown to Me and your brothers and sisters.

Your loving Saviour, Jesus Christ.",0.9987,553

"honestly amazes me still space stuff haha, it just blows my mind every time. im calling BS on the 'we wont have coverage to show you the other satellites' lol we can send signals to mars and vidio feeds all round the world, not to mention the space craft probably has the craziest signal being above the atmosphere at the same level of all the other satellites lol but im probably just not thinking of all the details that goes into it if im honest, im second guessing myself as i type but hey fuck it haha. 
it makes me sad knowing i most probably wont be alive when the times comes that space travel is advanced enough and safe enough that its like a bus ride, id love to go to other planets. its silly to believe there isn't other life out there as well, just look at earth...millions of different species on this tiny rock, how can there not be life out there.
it makes my head tingle thinking about other life out there, completely oblivious to the whole human race & the whole of earths history, even time and dates mean nothing to the rest of the universe, makes me feel we are so primitive and isolated, everything we have ever know, all our history, all the wars and fighting over territory has all taken place on earth. it all seems so pointless lol.
  life on other planets probably is so different to everything we know as ordinary, we couldn't comprehend, there could be life that literally can move things with its mind or sees with x-rays, i dunno lol my minds buzzing with all these ideas. like we thing we know all the elements  and all metals etc... we could probably be only scratching the surface of other materials out there we could find crazy metals so light we can we can life a ton of it on our pinky, yet its so strong it can stop a nuke blast point blank lol i dunno...

the biggest fear and disappointment i fear is the competitiveness of countries trying to dominate space and race against each other and all that crap. i feel, once you leave earth you leave your allegiance to your country, you become a citizen of earth... all countries should work together, leaving earth is a thing for the whole human race, not its individual countries, the countries should only exist on earth, off earth the shouldn't be any countries making any mark, the only thing making a mark is mankind as a whole. also an EXTREMELY STRICT NO RELIGION OFF EARTH RULE, i can not stress that enough! spreading all that to space is the top most toxic thing to do!, no individual countries, no religion, no single governing entity like the controlling EU...i dunno ive not thought it out  lol but 100% no religion! no point taking cultures and traditions off earth either, completely new ones will be formed in time anyway living off earth and in space is a completely new and other way of life. lol im getting farrrr to into this haha.",0.723,575
