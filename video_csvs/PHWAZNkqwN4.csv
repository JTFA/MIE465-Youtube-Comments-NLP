"All of my mouth was kissing him
Now, into the air, I am missing him
Is this excess texting a blessing?
Two music nerds obsessing

He reminds me of the love in me
I'm celebrating on a vibrancy
Sending each other MP3s
Falling in love to a song

This handsomest of wickermen
He asked if I could wait for him
Now, how many lightyears this interim
While I fall in love with his songs?

His hands are good in protecting me
Touching and caressing me
But would it be trespassing
Wanting him to be blissing me
Robbing him of his youth?

Cliffhanger-like suspension
My longing has formed its own skeleton
Bridging the gap between singletons
Sending each others these songs

The interior of these melodies
Is perhaps where we are meant to be
Our physical union a fantasy
(I just fell) I just fell in love with a song

So, I reserve my own intimacies
I bundle them up in packages
My rawward longing far too visceral

"this is the first time I missed the release of a Bjork album , because of her face on the cover it looks a bit like a weird doll not knowing Bjork is behind the mask  of this wax like figure  , on this video her face is cleverly reshaped  but prefer her own tiny nose , the other videos like Utopia of this album are  disappointing  it's all a bit vague the colors are vague and monotonous slimy, fleshy pink an odd place for fairies  usually her videos are fabulous and surprisingly  unpredictable  , I love the flute as a  theme instrument and was hoping for more varied themes and sounds of the flutes and style of music it's all very dreamy sometimes ambient even it lacks tracks that stand out ! Maybe I'll change my opinion after listening a couple of times , but usually I'm very excited with a new album of Bjork .............",0.9597,158
