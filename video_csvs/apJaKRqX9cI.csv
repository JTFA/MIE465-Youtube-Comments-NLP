"100% me :D I wish everyone I know would watch this so they know I am not unable to decide - because at the end of the overthinking process I usually come to the same conclusion as at the very start 😆  It's just how my poor not-validated-from-parental-figures mind is used to work. I can confirm that mindfulness is great technique. I absolutely love Headspace app, it's a great tool to create the mindfulness meditation habit. From my experience the decisions/opinions I make right after meditation are the best for me. It takes a while to be able to catch yourself while overthinking and to stop and trust what your calm mind has told you. But trust me - once you try it you are going to see positive results in your life faster than you expect :)) And even though my decisions are not perfect now I see myself trust ""the calm version of myself"" more and more. What is perfection anyways, I like the direction my life is taking since I started to practice mindfulness and that's most important :) Definitely give it a try!",0.9941,202

"I think overthinking is NOT a bad habit or a behavior that should be avoided. Because it means spanning more ideas and exploring more thinking space than usual. So you have a better chance to solve a problem or give nicer solutions. Downside is, you may just spend more energy than a necessary amount to solve a problem. It is bad only if you stuck at a specific thinking pattern and this kind of thinking gives you anxiety. Solution comes from stepping back from your emotional perspective and always making experiments then giving conclusions.",-0.1137,101

Like Idk but this helped me out alot. Stoping yourself in your tracks and being real with yourself could help more than you think. + I got sick and tired of making myself feel so bad that I got really depressed. 
I still overthink sometimes but definitely  not as much as I used to before. Just reminding yourself that you are a human-being and that we all make mistakes are natural.

I cannot say that I no longer overthink, but I can say that I can manage it. My enotions and my thoughts, I can effectively observe it and tweak it to become a useful one. I have also learned logical ways to upbring my children in the future so that they will not generate mental illnesses due to poor parenting.

"You can turn overthinking off. When I was younger I would get into overthinking loops often linked to things I was anxious about. I am quiet and introverted so I would roleplay the scenario in my head many times as to what I would say. When it came time to actually speak, I wouldn’t say a fifth of what I had thought up. Eventually I decided not to let myself do this role playing and restrict myself to just speaking to the other person. In connection with actually speaking, or writing, I took responsibility for what I said. If I spoke out of turn or got my facts incorrect I was willing to apologize or correct myself. Being intuitive and reflective doesn’t mean clear sight. There is a good reason understanding is referred to a foggy glass/mirror. I have found that many times, my reflections focus on verifying the interpretations of reality presented by my friends and wider culture. Internally, my reflections compare that to all data, anecdotes and experiences I have collected. When it is false I am happy to cry foul but like anyone who cherishes anything, I know that my reflection can ignore the very falsehood in lies and tales I have come to cherish. The insights one gets have a real very opportunity to be tainted in this way but because they do not come from unreliable culture or family so are trusted more and an intuitive like yourself can present them with great confidence. Intuit away... but please be careful with what you find. 😉",0.9881,288
