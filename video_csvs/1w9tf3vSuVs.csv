"2017 the year of rude awakenings.  2018 is all about go after our passions (I hope lol). I connected to many of the things you've gone through... I think it is kind of interesting how different people react to stress though, I'm not as positive most of the time...my sense of humor is/ was cynical and through my having no income flow most of last yr, displacement and having to be a present mommy for my kids....I actually learned to be a lot more uplifting and positive... I wish I could say ""then my former self"" but still a working progress. I feel like I'm back to the way I was through my childhood in many ways and which got me through a lot of negative things...anywho, I'm glad to see you back. I've been a silent fan for maybe 3 or 4 years? Your videos often got me through my nights of work (I'm a Virtual Assistant who loves to work at night lol). I think we all faced that reset button in 2017 ...2018 should be IS GOING TO BE so much better!",0.9604,211

"Boss is loaded anyway you want to be a leader. I recently ended a business with a partner because honestly we just didn't see eye to eye and money was running out, but I saw the problem before hand and was able to invest in a website I'm running by myself and using overseas writers to help me upkeep. I am taking one more risk trying to get traffic up, but if it pays off it'll be well worth it.

"I feel like I relate to you a lot Maya. I recently had a moment where I realized that I had a lot of weight on my shoulders from life, that I was trying to support all on my own. I tried to live my life in a way where people thought I had it all together because I wanted people to look at me as someone they could admire. I wouldn't say that I was trying to pretend to be someone I wasn't but there was a lot of things going on in my life that people didn't know about. Social media is a wonderful tool but it can also be harmful, if you allow it to go to your head. You subject yourself to a lot of commentary from people who either criticize what you do or idolize you without even knowing your story. I've developed very thick skin but after awhile this very issue began to wear on me. I've been watching you for a few years now and you're honestly inspiring. I love how real and raw you are. You aren't afraid to talk about your life struggles in the same way you are able to talk about your highlights. I have a lot that I plan to accomplish in life and I feel like, as a 20 year old college student, I've allowed one too many people to get in the way of my success. I believe that the only true limits in life are ones that we set on ourselves. I give all credit to my faith in God for having this mindset. For the new upcoming year, I'm going to let all of that go. I just want to thank you for using your platform to spread a positive message to your supporters. You've really inspired me chase after my dreams and pursue all of my passions. You've been a prime example of someone who was able to do all of that despite facing hardships. Like you, I plan to encourage people to have that fighters spirit; especially young women. Hopefully one day, I am able to make as big of an impact in peoples lives as you've had on mine.",0.9977,395

I always find your videos when they are relevant to an event in my life.  I'm about to graduate high school and leave the path of uncertainty.  To think I've been watching your videos since my Junior High days is an amazing feeling.  I know that God will continue to have amazing plans in his work for you!

"Yes ma’am! I’ve experienced a veryyyyyy similar self reflection this year. I stepped into a leadership position where I was managing numerous people; dealing with a lot of personalities and had to invest all of my time to do so. 

I was doing generally good I will say until it all got veryyyyy overwhelming! Then I went into “ hiding “ in a sense haha but not moreso hiding but moreso a very FFFFFFFFFFF it attitude. Which surprisingly worked! And is working! 

The attitude wasn’t coming from a negative space but a space of me wanting to regain back control of my purpose. 

In that process I had my fair share of sleeping on sofas, losing friends, getting fired from everyyyyyyywhere and even having to stop doing all I WANTED to do. However I was constantly being provided with all that I NEEDED and that was just so miraculous to me! I’m still so astounded and grateful and in awe of how much He came thru for me.

So fast forward to present tense; after I was knocked down to thee absolute BASICS and the smoke had all cleared I’m now walking into a different direction and although the direction I came from was such AMAZING opportunities; these new opportunities are CLEARLY fruits of my fight, my struggle and my labor. 

At the end of the day; your soul, your spirit, your personality and the way you’re able to connect with people will ultimately be what drives you on this journey. 

Stay Shameless,

"Yo Maya.. wait.. first thing’s first my name is not Samuel, it’s whitley LOL and im a girl under my husbands name 🤣 just to clear that up. But, yo, I am sitting here watching your video and man, girl. I. Feel.You. I really dont even post comments on youtube like that — or ever, really — but i feel compelled to right now and I’m going to do it anyways and be SHAMELESS (like you say) because I believe it’s important. But I am SO proud of where you are at, if that makes sense at all. I am SO thankful for the place you are right now because you are in an AMAZING place. Being in the Lord’s will is an awesome place to be. We all go through seasons. And seasons help us grow. And you said it — Stretched. You are being stretched and the Lord is right there in the midst of it all. I have been watching you for a while - i love your tech talks more than anything (and of course your awesome, hilarious personality) - and from the get go I knew that you are a special person (i mean everyone is special, but you hold a place in my heart and i dont even know you, know you! Lol! But seriously, you are right where you need to be and the Lord is going to honor you as long as you keep yourself aligned with Him FIRST. Listen to HIS voice. His word says “But first and most importantly seek (aim at, strive after) His kingdom and His righteousness [His way of doing and being right--the attitude and character of God], and all these things will be given to you also. “So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”
‭‭MATTHEW‬ ‭6:33-34‬ ‭AMP‬‬

Continue to do you (boo) & be shameless (for Jesus)! The Lord is doing an amazing work in you and  just like Ecclesiastes says — He has made ALL things beautiful and appropriate in it’s time, so “...let endurance have its perfect result and do a thorough work, so that you may be perfect and completely developed [in your faith], lacking in nothing.” (<- James 1:4)

"its nice to see big youtubers expressing themselves in a way like this. I can relate on so many levels its crazy, especially when you mentioned your boyfriend lol mine helped me realize that I need to get my ish together. I would get so frustrated at little small things to the point I was just annoyed at everyone and everything for no reason. My boyfriend got it the worst because we live together. one day we got into a really biggg argument and it kind of woke me up in a sense and made me realize A LOT of  things. I don't want to make this comment any longer by writing all the things I realize after our argument lol but my mind is a lot clearer and my boyfriend and I are still together and happier than before. Im 24 I feel like 2017 was the year I found who I am and 2018 is the year I'm being who I am lol. Stay shameless and Stretch free Maya!!!!! and ill be doing the same lol",0.8833,189
