"I don't think it's fair to tell people how they feel or to say one person's experience is worse than another's. This doesn't seem like something she is super comfortable talking about and no one should have to justify how they feel to anyone. Just because you don't think she has anxiety doesn't mean that she doesn't meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder. I may not have enough information to diagnose her but I also don't have enough information to rule out a diagnosis. We don't know what goes on in her private life. We only see the persona that she puts out there so we have no right to say she doesn't have anxiety. I don't think you meant any harm by your comment but the truth is, comments like these make individuals who do have anxiety disorders much less likely to ask for help. As someone who has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and is currently working on a major in psychology, this is my opinion based on my own experiences and what I've learned in my classes so far. You, of course, are welcome to your own opinion. I'm just suggesting that perhaps you should think before claiming you know more about what someone is experiencing than they do especially when you don't know them outside of what they put online. My own mother told me several times before I was formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder that everyone feels nervous sometimes and that it was normal. She wasn't trying to minimize my problems. She just didn't know everything I was experiencing because I didn't share that with her. Likewise, Liza doesn't share everything about herself with us. Nor should she have to.",-0.9764,308
