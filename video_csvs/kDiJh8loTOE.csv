We are still a few months away from proper transfer window. Roadster will go into sun orbit that will cross Mars orbit. So there will be an encounter but the roadster is in sun orbit not Mars orbit. So similar to normal transfer but no burn to enter Mars orbit. Probably a pretty close flyby for some good shots but haven't seen any info on what the closest approach to Mars will be. For a real Mars mission you would wait a bit more and gain more delta-V and reduce travel time but for a test flyby its a pretty decent time to launch. Any delay makes it easier. And since they won't enter orbit they don't have to as accurate so moving around the launch date is not that bad. On a proper Mars mission you'd have to recalculate all the burns every few days delay.,0.9598,156
