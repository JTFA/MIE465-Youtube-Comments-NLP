Dallas made me so mad taking her to fucking Highland Park of all places. Everything and everyone there are like little awful clones of eachother. Should have taken her to Deep Elm and let her see an actual badass part of the city and taken her to the unique little boutique's there. She loves black for Godsake she would have had a brilliant time there and found amazing one of a kind pieces for way better prices than fucking Highland Park. So lame.,0.8619,88
