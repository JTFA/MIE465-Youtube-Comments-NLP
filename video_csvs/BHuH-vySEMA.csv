It'd be great if you guys could use adult shelter dogs instead. Puppy are easier to get adopted compared to shelter dogs who have histories.

"Leslie Espinola While I agree about your sentiments that ""any attention to the subject is good"", any cursory search of a rescue will show that the adult dogs up for adoption greatly outnumber the puppies. Whether this is due to more adults being abandoned or puppies being adopted sooner, the unfortunate reality is that people as a whole find puppies more desirable than adult dogs.
