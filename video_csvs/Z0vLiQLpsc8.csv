8 school shootings this year? One illegal immigrant causes a car accident and we need to build a wall? Kimmel is the one that is mentally ill. Does he not realize that there are already laws in place to keep the shooter from buying a firearm. Does Kimmel not realize that the police made over 40 visits to the shooter and had enough to lock him up? Does Kimmel not realize that the FBI was tipped off about him twice and did nothing to stop him? That is the change we need and not passing more laws that will not fix anything.,-0.8615,109

I have taken issue with a few thing she has said to children which I think are inappropriate and disgusting. I noticed that the comments have been disabled in said videos. When asking a little girl where babies come from the child answered 'when a mom and dad make love'. This disgusting woman then asked this little girl 'what loser makes love?'. What kind of thing is that to say to a child? that woman should not be allowed to do that job.
here's the video she asks it just over a minute in.

"Hey, I'm all for the talk. Debate. But, most interviews for the Super Bowl winners happened past Wednesday and Thursday, right?

The fact of the matter is this -- Have a little consideration. If your significant person died in a plane crash, just for example. You need TIME to process? Yes? It's not a fact, nor would it be very reverent or relevant to be discussing POLITICS in the lieu of a ""tragedy"". Yet one thing we see very much in common with all of these ""events"" -- Same day or next day trumpeteering alllllll over the airwaves. WE NEED GUN CONTROL! WE NEED DREAMERS! WE NEED BLAHDEBLAH! NO MORE RACISM! Nobody actually GRIEVES anymore. You just come to jump down somebody's throat, stand up on your soap box and try to be heard. You embrace those 103+ likes. You get titillated by those 15 minutes of fame, don't you? Everyone cashes in, tries to sound like a damn hero, when ultimately it is disrespectful to the dead, the living, and anyone with a heart who's EVER lost a loved one... These people parading around with crocodile tears (yourself included perhaps), just hoping HEY I GOT SOME RECOGNITION! *STOP BLAMING THOSE WHO HAVE COMPASSION, BUT WANT TO THINK CRITICALLY!* Everyone looooves the #metoo BS. Just hop on in the bandwagon! But the ultimate mockery comes from when you all beat your chest, one by one, and suck the validity of the argument like leeches. For every one known victim, there may be 15 false reports. But ehh, what do I know? So much easier to go with the majority! Think for yourself, I'm sure you may be capable! But the thing is, we *all* need time to think. It's not ""Sir your son died"" ""THAT'S IT... I'M CALLING CONGRESS!!!"" ... There is hardly any impact. People have become so shallow anymore, you hang these politicians who actually want to take a step back and look at the larger picture. Ya know, that ol' critical thinking again. We live in a society where possession of marijuana can get you harsher charges than that of a sex offender. Think of that for a second. Stop going and acting as if you, or Jimmy Kimmel, or Ellen Degenerate, or (insert Democrat here) could do such greater of a job than whoever you feel like bashing this time. I believe in our government, but all of this ""red vs blue"" ""left vs right"" ""I'm right and you're a moron!"" penny Anny bull crap really has to stop. If we can, AS ADULTS, speak to each other, instead of using ANY situation as a spark to ""WELL AREN'T YA GONNA DO SOMETHING?!"" ... You realize *that's* what's radicalizing these kids. They try to push the envelope. You all want to be heard so bad, but refuse to LISTEN to *reason.* Refuse to accept *logic.* If we are to be a REPUBLIC, we must agree. There is no one way to peel a potato. There's no one way to wash a dog. Realize this.

"Yeah. A glock, Beretta , sig sauer, walther, or literally any other semi automatic handgun can fire just as fast as an ar-15. Why aren't they trying to ban all weapons? Because the Armalite rifle 15(not assault rifle) is black and scary to non gun owners. Any one could sneak a full size handgun into a school and wreak havoc. But all these dumbest liberals talk about is the scary black rifles. So what happens when you ban the purchase or ownership of a gun? Law abiding citizens will follow the law and remain helpless to the government and the everyday criminal. While the criminal finds a gun illegally and still commits the crime on a defenseless public. Overthrow the second amendment and I guarantee you'll start a civil war. Less than 20,000 murders a year are committed in the US from guns. 300,000+ lives are saved a year from lawful owners.",-0.9944,172
