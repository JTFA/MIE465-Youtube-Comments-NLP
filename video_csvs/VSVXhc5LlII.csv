"you guys do realize motors arnt magic and have already been made long ago......u can get a 2000hp fkin 2 liter 4 cylinder.....theres tons of vettes on the road today where people build them to 2000 hp.....a street car motor strait from chevy.....and you know what, they cant even use that power, even in a zr1 with huge ass drag tires that wont let u go around a fkin turn lol. what makes you think this is so special lol, u could just throw 2 production ass chevy v8's in a car and wallaaa, theres ur 5khp. idk much about making 2 motors work or whatever, or what chasi ur going to fit them in lol, but seriously.

on the other hand tho, now that we know its not MAGIC, its still awesome as all hell, and obv the way ud want to go, if they do it right anyways, and its reliable, refined etc etc. u get it all in a proper awesome package. BUT, that still leaves the probelm of, why the fuck do i need 5000 hp for a road car lol, specially since i cant even use it, infact, the second i hit the gas my car flys about 200ft to the left of me taking out 4 cars and a mcdonalds...... i mean really, the hp is probably unusable as all hell, maby in this setup if done right they can make what 2k of it usable? and thats on what kind of bullshit tires i dont want on my car?

basically they are trying to sell u a drag car with a supercar body??? u can just build a damn drag car with 2khp that'll do the quarter in 5 seconds on some big gay tires for what like $50k??? whats the point in spending 3 million on one with a fancy body lol.

no, they are going in the wrong direction, until people figgure out how to make cars able to handle the power, while keeping handling, companies only need to be looking at making the nicest thing possible, usable, best handling, for the lowest price.

sure they will still be ppl with small penis that want this, and some with big, but mostly its dumb when u can get something that will likely be way more usable and handle better for 10% of the price. like a fucking zr1 lol.",0.8525,456
