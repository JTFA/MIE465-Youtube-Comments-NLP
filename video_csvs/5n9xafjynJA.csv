"Engine output given in Watts is not the same as actual work done in Watts. On top of that electric appliances are often way more efficient than those burning fuel of some sort or depending on a heat source. There is no linear way to easily calculate the amount of power needed to be stored in an electric car based on figures from a diesel truck.
Such a truck would be a giant battery array anyway, the actual motors are tiny compared to a regular fossil fuel engine and making it all feasible is about increasing efficiency not just amount of energy stored.
Electric batteries are less efficient way of storing energy than fossil fuels but electric engines are way, way more efficient than any fossil fuel engine.

Regular teslas weight more than 3 tons and offer great performance so unless they hit a thermal limit and cannot make the ratio of energy stored to weight of whole vehicle good enough for hauling goods it is just a matter of time and time we do have for electric, we are only running out of time for oil.",0.9747,196

"remember, electric cars can be charged by any locations with access to power, meaning rest areas can have infrastructure built on them to provide some meaningful charge, its why a majority of Tesla are charged at home and not at a special charging station, but since trucks get more use they will have to install more then just regular 480V plugs at rest areas. not every trucker drives 1500 miles wich is a key point, they are trying to sell to a majority not a long range minority, also electric motors are very efficient even when going uphill so dont compare it to energy loss of a diesel engine, plus there is regenerative braking, so when you go down hill the motors start recharging the battery.",0.4697,136

"wellfudgethis explanation for the low range 500 miles and 80000 lb load is because most trips are under 500 miles and if you're going for a trip over 500 miles you can just charge up on the next station fuel station, there is bound to be one every 500 miles. And I'm pretty sure they could just seal the bottom of vehicle to make sure no salt gravel or snow get into the motors, they are independent so if one breaks down you can still use the other three, the biggest problem will come from the battery which would probably weigh around 13,000 lb, and is receiving didn't want energy being drained from a possibly one megawatt hour battery is probably going to be 1-3% for a night.",-0.5,135
