I bet he did roast him. Otherwise this makes no sense! But at least Steve doesn't have to feel bad about his defense game. That guy attacking really just couldn't hack it. He had to grab something to fight with. Lame.,-0.9168,47

"I love comedy, but when I go to a comedy club, I expect to have fun and be entertained, not be harassed by someone with a weak routine. He just happened to roast the wrong dude, sorry to say but he's lucky he didn't have a gun. Otherwise this video would be very dark.",0.9449,61
I think it was an act. its all bull shit. and he acts happy and excited over the attention. and no security???? yeah like... OK ( rolls eyes),0.7501,36
"I was at the show the night before.  It was a great show but Steve did clown the audience half of the night. It is not hard to believe he was joking on dude and he got upset.  One video shows how Skip (another comedian) was trying to diffuse the situation but Steve kept going with the guy and that's when Skip exited the stage and the guy entered.  Steve should have left the stage or got security to handle what he claims was going down in the audience.  

Another thing, Steve I know you're reading this. I was not to far from u Saturday when you pulled out your phone and said, ""Another sold out show"" while filming the audience. I hate to break it to you but your show was FREE.  Now Jess is coming here soon and if ticket sales are low for her she will be FREE too.  Encourage yourself but keep it real.",0.9312,174

Lauvlee Yang thank you!! I knew that slap stuff was something Steve made up.  From the angle I saw it looked like Skip was trying to stop Steve from engaging with the guy then he gave up.  Steve was antagonizing the dude who was already mad when he couldve stopped and that's why the comedy house docked his pay.  Steve needs yo keep it 100.,-0.3578,71

Sharnique Dasant yes! I used to like the comedy house.  Of course I only go when the tickets are free like it was for Steve's show.  They're too unorganized with all the waiting and being piled up in the lobby before shows. No metal detectors no real security just two old guys.  I'm glad it was no worse that it was.,0.8622,67

"This story is out of order. I was one table over from the attacker, and My Mom is the one who recorded the from the other angle prior to him rushing on stage. His family attempted to calm him down and keep him from going up on stage. The lady that was trying to hold him he ""PUSHED"" her and said 'Get off me MAMA!' It was his mother who got pushed, NOT slapped. Several who tried to calm him down were pushed out of the way as he tried to get to Steve. There were no security. The guy who Steve thought was security was a patron trying to help and calm him down. When Steve initially asked him was he ok the guy said 'Leave me alone!' The guy started talking junk. Because there was no security is why the young man was able to get onto the stage. Kitchen staff acted as security towards the end, which is who you see on the stage.",0.893,188
