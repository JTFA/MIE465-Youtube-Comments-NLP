"Lyrics:
Santa, baby, please be fast
Joy to the world and all that jazz
It's a wonderful life to be happy with the people you love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So fix the shining star for all to see
Fire up the mistletoe and light the tree
Ain't no feeling like this, that can get you like the holiday bug
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
So hang the pretty stockings by the chimney with care
And lay right by the fire, there's a nip to the air
And celebrate the holiday with presents to spare, oh yeah

And now it feels like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
It's like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you, yeah

Hark the herald angel sings
Just hopin' Santa brings her a wedding ring
There's some beautiful things that she could show 'em off whenever she wants
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget about the heartache, there's so much to be shared
A million invitations and I'm gonna prepare
And celebrate the holiday with presents to spare
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

And now it feels like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
It's like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you

Now it feels like Christmas
Oh, it feels like Christmas
Feels like Christmas
Now it feels like Christmas
Yeah, it feels like Christmas
Oh, it feels like Christmas
Yeah, it feels like Christmas
Now it feels like Christmas
Feels like Christmas",0.9879,353
