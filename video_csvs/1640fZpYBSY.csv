"I will put it this way to best explain: next roll, 50% chance he gets a car. He now has a car, this is good for 2 reasons: first reason you are in need of a car, second reason you can afford to resale a car, which also brings us to the negative which is that not everybody can afford to resale or own another car. I personally would not have the money or the ability to take out a loan to pay on taxes and i would be stuck into a payment plan to pay out taxes into a car that i would not be able to sell until i meet what i owe in taxes and since i also am not in need of a car this will hurt my income. Now on the other hand 50% chance he gets more money, $500, $1,000 or $1,500 only 16.6% chance to get another $1,500. And then there is more to talk about if he goes for the last roll. But this is the moment that he decides where you figure do you take a chance on cash or go for the car, best outcome you get straight cash for those people who would not be positively affected from winning a car. Best outcome for someone who is positively affected from winning a car is an obvious choice to take both the next rolls recieving more money or a car. I hope everybody now fully understands; and yes there is also a chance this guy wanted a car and did not listen to the host telling him he has 2 more chances and could also win more money, but there is not enough evidence here for me to make the call that this was either strategic or stupidity.",0.9201,324

Higher tax brackets work like this. For simplicity, let's say $10,000 is the cut off for a tax bracket. If you make $10,001 it puts you in the next tax bracket. The $10,000 tax bracket is 10%. The next tax bracket is 20%. The person who makes $10,000 is taxed 10% of that: $1,000. The person who makes $10,001 is taxed 10% on the first $10,000 and 20% on the amount above $10,000. $1 at 20% is 20 cents. So if you make $10,001, you'd be taxed $1,000.20 not $2,000.20.
