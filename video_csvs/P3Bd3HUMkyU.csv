"Nintendo, if you guys do look at the comment section, please read this:
Your idea is super cool. Really, I think that by making it cardboard, you have just unlocked the possibility to make virtually any game possible on the switch, and by making it cardboard, its dirt cheap!...right?
That brings me to my problem: *you guys are charging too much!* I understand they all come with a game, but maybe sell the labo and the game separately? Make it cheaper for everyone? Then, if someone's labo breaks, they can get a new one without having to pay an extra $60 for *breaking a piece of cardboard.*
I really think you guys have made something incredible. But you have to make it affordable, or else it will never catch on.",0.5815,158
