He takes Caffeine pills for sure. I hate coffee. Like I don't hate it but I hate drinking it like its a daily driver. A big cup of cappuccino is like a meal to me. I would sit down and enjoy it with someone. But I take caffeine pills about 75 milligrams each day. But sometimes I stay awake 24+ hrs. That takes about 300 mg.,0.5346,75

"eating meats based on studies over decades proves that you will die earlier than pure vegan eaters. it is not healthier than a vegan diet. i am no vegan but admit that this diet is not the healthiest. brady is a genetic athlete. he isn't where he is because of his diet or we would all be there. this diet works for him but for the avg. population based on science, it is best to limit meats dramatically or entirely cut out. yes i eat meat. i don't care for veganism. but state facts for what they are.",0.521,109
