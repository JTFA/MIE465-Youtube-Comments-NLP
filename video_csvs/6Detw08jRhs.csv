WTF I don't even understand the message. Can one of y'all explain that shit to me. RN it looks like women are becoming men or men are becoming women and we should promote them because they are doing that. And trick the people watching that it was a woman and checking them out then realizing it's a guy. I don't fucking understand how retarded society is nowadays. Wtf I though it was a girl modeling shoot and stared at dat ass WTF why do this to people!!!???,-0.9773,98
