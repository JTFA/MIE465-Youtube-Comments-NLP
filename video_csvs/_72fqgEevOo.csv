The old estate tax is 5.49 million before you pay taxes. Obama insisted on a 68% estate tax. So you would have to take tax on 3.51 million at a 68% which comes out to round up to 2.39 million. Farmers do not have that kind of money to pay for the taxes. This causes many farmers to sell the farm when the parents die. This is just a 1,000 acre farm not even the 1,500 acre family farm I came from. I know many FAMILY farms in my area that have 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 and even over 10,000 acres.",-0.4404,174

I'd say at least half of those who are self made actually worked really hard, took a lot of risks and made sacrifices to get where they are......why do you think so many of them barely find time to spend with their families etc....they're busy.....there are more kinds of busy and hard work than blue collar jobs. Folks that wealthy just usually use their brains , social, and leadership skills, more than their bodies or stuff learned from formal education like the lower and middle class, and apparently that pays far more...and allows one to be more in control of their work lives and free time.....either way,...saying they ""sit around doing nothing"" is just as ignorant and presumptuous as them saying that all poor people just don't work hard enough. It's not how hard you work that makes the real difference in income normally, it's what kind of work you choose to do, and what resources you have/had, and sometimes just plain luck.",0.4019,257
