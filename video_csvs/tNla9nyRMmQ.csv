"As an American who lives in France no matter how you put it most Americans are just to stupid to understand how healthcare works in the rest of the free world. Years of propaganda and incorrect information has made this a reality and I don’t see it changing anytime soon! But for the sake of argument I’ll explain my experience with the medical system in France. 

The way it works here is social security pays 80% of medical costs when you’re in the hospital. The rest is paid by a private insurance you buy and pay very low premiums for, for example mine costs me just 25€ a month and covers everything from medication to dental. Now it is true we do pay higher taxes here BUT if I was to buy insurance in the United States at the same level of coverage as here and had a zero dollar deductible it would cost easily more than $1,000 a month! Far more than I pay in taxes for the same benefits! Another example I can give is I’ve had two major spinal fusion surgeries here in France. Back in the USA who knows what it would of cost me out of pocket even with good insurance. Here I paid zero out of pocket both times! Everything from multiple scans, MRI’s, medication, the surgeries, and staying in the hospital a week was covered! I paid nothing extra!

Another thing that’s worth saying since I’ve seen it mentioned several times. America isn’t the only country that has made HUGE medical advances! Modern Cataract surgery in 1748, The Stethoscope in 1816, Codeine 1832, Aspirin 1853, Hypodermic needle 1853, Rabies vaccine 1855, Tuberculosis vaccines 1921, Insulin pump 1981, Discovery of the HIV virus 1983, First Hand transplantation 1998,    and the First Face transplant in 2005!

If you want to make a fair comparison between USA and Europe, you have to add to the french  salaries all the costs an US citizen has to pay from his pocket to get the same service. In fact US studies (i insist, not european studies) have showned that the european system is way more efficient  than the american one, which, BTW, kills the idea of corrupt services when runned by government. And that is possible because of a BIG difference in the choices we make as nations. In USA, the Army's budget is prioritary, nobody messes with military, it's a sacred thing. In France, it's the health care system. An american is often thinking ""what do i get for my tax dollar ?"", when a french thinks ""is the health system working well for everybody ?""In our mind military comes after health, education, culture etc... . We don't need a lot of cash to get a good life, because we all pay with our taxes all the expensive spendings. The idea behind is that education, for instance, is important for each one, but even more for the country, then it's important to make sure than everybody can have a free access to it.

First off, the private sector is spending so much because they are the innovators, we drive the scientific discovery and development of medicine and procedures. Also, we have the best healthcare in the world. Our hospitals rival hotels in other countries, and when the rich get sick in Europe, they come here. Whats worse is he misrepresents those stats. Of course, our Medicare and Medicaid will be more expensive than countries that have their entire health care system run by the government, WHEN WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE. If the government stopped meddling in the healthcare system, we could cut costs more. The problem is, it is so expensive to insure people when gov't forces the companies to abide by frivilous codes, and forcing doctors to, this was in the newest obamacare policy, throw out the old codes from the past (report what happened to the patient or what they suffer from in shorhand, basically) for new codes that are so extensive and specific as to be useless. There is a code for being bitten by a goose in the bedroom!",-0.6975,215
"Ok, I'm Canadian living in the US so I've seen it from both sides.  Before the great recession I had great coverage (and income lol) so the inflated costs did not bother me.  Now I have worse (translation, big medical bills when something happens, not quality of service) coverage than one of my siblings in Canada who is unemployed.

I'm conservative by nature but the one point this guy made that resonates (with me) is ""healthcare is one of those things that the government can do better than the private sector"".
It almost feels weird to say this but after more than 50 orbits on this planet I now believe this is a rare exception to the normal rule that is the other way around, private is better.

But on the other hand if you allow real competition and possibility to choose people will be better. For example if you have to pay yourself for your treatment you will take better care of yourself but if the government promises you it does not matter if you eat not healthy food, smoke or do drugs we will take care of you. You saying that the government is heaving the better position to make a better deal - ok, why don't you ask government to get a better deal on food prices? Why don't you ask government to make a deal with car companies? The same reason is for you not to ask government to make a deal on health care. The health system for pets is not government funded but it is working fine. Why? Because it allows real competition and you can choose better and more expensive care or cheaper - it's up to you because it is your money.",0.9916,213

I was in a doctor's office the other day...I went in about 9:30 AM and got out of there close to 1:30 pm because I was waiting in line. Talk about torture. We still have to pay for our own prescriptions.  In BC hospitals we have some of the worst care, where they replaced a percentage of real registered nurses with care aids. No wonder mistakes in hospitals have increased. 

I have heard people say they have waited 5 hours waiting in the ER and finally they receive some help...sitting there in agony and pain. Basically at present Canadian healthcare is comparable to walking into a free clinic (hyperbole used). Please don't use Canada as an example...yes, we won't lose our house paying for our medical bill but we don't receive as good care as you guys get in American hospitals (people who have decent healthcare plans). Wait times is the weight that breaks the camel's back in Canada. In USA all you guys need is price control.
