"*SPOILERS AHEAD* Sorry to break it to everyone, but the movie was an insult to Star Wars fans and overall a terrible story. I genuinely feel so sorry for the people that put their hard work and energy into the premiere of this over hyped movie. Minus well fire Leland Chee (The Keeper of the Holocron), because it seems he was not part of this at all. And Oh God THE PLOT HOLES and the lazy character development! Snoke ended up being nobody, Rey is now a confirmed Mary Sue with no explanation why she can somehow do anything and everything with ease (her family were literally junkers who ""sold her off for drinking money""), The whole Anakin lightsaber vision Rey had sub-plot didn't go anywhere with no Anakin connection (who is the focal point of Star wars canon itself), and Luke Skywalker who surpassed his father, died of exhaustion. Poor Mark Hamill, he waited so long to play his character and gave it his all, just to die in the end. Kathleen Kennedy, Disney, Rian Johnson, and any other people who have tried to push their political agenda into this franchise have officially ruined Star Wars. And trust me the problems I listed with this movie are just the tip of the iceberg.",-0.9932,243

"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
These movies used to make me smile
And I knew if I pushed the play
That everything would be OK
And maybe I'd be happy for a while

But the Last Jedi made me shiver
With every single frame delivered
I can't believe what they've done
Don't think I'll watch the next one

And I remember how I sighed¬†
When they made good old Leia fly
Something just broke deep inside
The day the Star Wars died

So bye, bye things I loved as a child
I've seen Chewie in the movie, but the movie was dry...

I am really affraid of the futur of star wars. A lot of film director have been hired and then fired by K Kenedy. I have never seen such HR turn over issue in the past. This is probably the tip of the iceberg.  What is the cause ? How large is the problem ? Why such unstability ? are there any measure to solve the problem ?
