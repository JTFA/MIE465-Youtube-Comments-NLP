The younger people use latinx to conform to the non Latinos to make sure their feelings aren’t hurt when they have a non binary pronoun. Even in French when referring to a group of males and females. They use the male pronoun. So LATINO is used for all pronouns when referring to a group of people or to a male. Latina is used for females. But if a female group they are latinas never referred as Latinos,-0.2732,84
