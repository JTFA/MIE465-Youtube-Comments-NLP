"Somehow the Mac makeover made him look really different?  His face looks more square to me.  Idk if that's just me.  But I'm glad he had a good experience there.  I actually, completely honest, think that his look was the best.  It kind of blows my mind because all of these other artists are super experienced and he's just a teenager, but James IS super talent, and he knows what looks good on his own face.  He uses more cool tones for his foundation/bronzer, which works best for his naturally pink-ish skin.  (I have the same pinkish undertones on my skin as well..) And for some reason Sephora and Ulta made his skin look pinker/redder, which as he said might be attributed to the bad lighting in the store.  James just knows how to do his own face the best I think~",0.9875,164

"Your look was definitely the best-looking and most accurate. Sephora and Ulta made you way too orange, and Mac made you a bit too pale and matte. Mac had the best overall look of the store makeovers, but Sephora did do better than them at the eye makeup and choice of lip color. Loved this series and would def watch another one like this...but maybe with something even more challenging! I'm a belly dancer, so I love dramatic eyes with a sh*t ton of glitter and bright colors.",0.986,100
"Your look was the best but you have an unfair advantage in comparison that you know your own face the best. Next would definitely be the MAC makeover, it was beautiful but not tailored to you as well with the BB cream (which imo never does well with combo or oily skin).",0.968,57
