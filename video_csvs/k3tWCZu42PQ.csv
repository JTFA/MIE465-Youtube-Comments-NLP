"And the reason all turkeys can't be ""pardoned"" from merciless captivity and slaughter for the sake of clogging the arteries of a small family of humans is?... No, really, I'm seriously asking this question, Mr. Presidents and Washington Post. Humans DO NOT need to eat turkeys, pigs, cows, chickens, or any other animals. Just ask Bill Clinton, who claims going vegan recently ""wasn't a hard decision when faced with quadruple bypass surgery."" If only one of these genius role models would make an executive order to REMOVE ALL MEAT AND DAIRY FROM OUR SCHOOLS, the world would finally start to change for the better. Pop quiz, President Trump: what does the word, ""empathy,"" mean? Extra credit: what is the health benefit for humans to eat meat and dairy at all? Hint: the answers can be found in movies such as Forks Over Knives, Cowspiracy, and What the Health, all free to watch online or on Netflix. IT'S TIME TO WAKE THE F*CK UP!!!!!!!!!",0.8916,202
