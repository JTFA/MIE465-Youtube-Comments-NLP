If the sun wakes you up before then, turn your blinds the other way to make the room darker, close the curtains if you have them, and bury your face back in your covers. Take a looong 10 hour nap; then you'll see how great it is😂 and don't get in your phone",0.8796,98

"The fact you guys paid that jackass Luke O'Brien to make the worst editorial in history is joke. Andrew Anglin is the easiest target you could have gotten and all he did was provide baseless acussations/rumors and was very desperate to find any chump who had the slightest connection to him with going as far as stalking his mother and siblings with no results other than a fraudulent FBI report saying he was in Germany and anonymous ""witness"" in Ohio saying he was at a local super market who didn't even try to stop him or report him to the authorities. But hey, at least it turned out better than those garbage articles he is making at Huffpost.",-0.6478,126
