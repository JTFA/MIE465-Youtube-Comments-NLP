I didn't know anything about Kimbra. Didn't even know she was the person in Gotye's song. I was that clueless. Then she appeared in a related video in the sidebar and I've since listened to everything she's done. I pride myself in knowing current music but she humbled me.

"LYRICS ..

On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)

Under condition
We're on our way to the top
We got the world at our fingers
We make the penny drop

Got a means to get me outta the gate
And I won't stop till I wake
I'll say it loud till I mean it
Talk like I'll be the messiah

When I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
See me run
See me run
See me run with the girls
I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
I need a break, then I'll take to
To top of the world

On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)

Euphoria
I missed you like a new treasure
We go so good together
Search all my life to find better

But I won't hold my breath
I'll just fill up and deliver
They got attention deficit
I wait for the good lord to visit
Mary mary

All my life turned to dust
No one knew who to trust
Had a chance for a good life

See me on television
On billboards and banners
See me on white picket fences
Now watch me building my palace

Out on the run
You'll see me gathering martyrs
I won't forget where I started when we would
Pray from the gutters

Cause I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
Send me up
Send me up
With the diamonds and pearls
I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
They can talk, they can talk
But I got the good word

And it's crazy I'm defined brand new
It's amazing I got high on a view
But tonight I'm feeling tired and alone
Dear lord, I hope we didn't go wrong

I think I'm winning
Feel like I might
Feels like I'm in it
Feel like a god
I'm in demand
They're on my time
One in a million
Fought a good fight

On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)

We prayed from the gutters
Like martyrs we followed you
Prayed from the gutters
Like martyrs we followed you

I'm on top I'm on top
I'm top of the world
See me run, see me shout what I heard

I'm on top I'm on top
Top of the world

On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)

Uphill I'm winning
Not concerned if I'm cheating
They built me up to be beaten
They built me up to be beaten",0.9976,495
