Actually we find name monday really confusing. Before we used to say “add this task to dapulse” now we have to say “add this task to monday”. Like WTF?!,0.1528,37
Amazing.. congrats guys!,0.5707,5
Brenda Ann Spencer certainly didn't like Mondays :),-0.2937,8
"Google, Yahoo, Bing, Chrome, Safari, Flow, Asana..... These product names aren't biased to anything naturally, but they mean everything...However; Monday?... Monday, is kinda taken.",0.1045,39
"Ha. Exactly. Clarity wins every time. If you confuse, you lose. And unfortunately, with ""Monday"" and all its iterations and abbreviations, they've done nothing but thrown gas on the flame of confusion.  The burden of clarity always falls on the business, NOT the customer / user. - Never(!) hand your client a confusing proposition and expect them to carry the burden of clarity. Sadly, the dapulse team doesn't seem to grasp that, as evidenced by the robo-responses.  It's obvious corporate has issued a ""here's how we respond to objections"" script and that's what everyone gets... not realizing they're rejecting the [FREE] advice of brand specialists who have stewarded billion dollar brands before.  ""Comedy possibilities"" indeed... no one will be laughing when clients start jumping ship for clarity, b/c in the real world with large teams constantly sharing time sensitive details, incessant confusion over semantics is the last thing anyone will have the time or patience for.",0.8876,189
"I actually like the name dapulse. It was different, unique, and original.",0.5859,16
I also sent them 'Who's on first'.. I don't think they understood.,0.0,16
"I don't understand some comments. I think in the end the market cares less about a product's or a company's name. Dapluse, Monday, Banana or Apple, what matters is the quality of the UX/CX delivered. 
I mean, Smith&Wesson and Ben&Jerry follow the same naming concept despite being of very different industries. Then nothing conveys their activity relating to ""guns"" or ""ice screams"" in their names neither. Yet their business are doing pretty well. So, I believe names don't define your industry success, would they carry or not your brand's mission.

Edit: I actually came here to comment that the ""M"" of Monday looks a lot like a flipped version of Warner Music's ""W""  ;)",0.9231,142
"I hear you, Kevin. We all do. These aren't robo responses, but us trying to give you an understanding of why we made this decision. We've gotten a ton of feedback on the name, and people are super passionate about their perspective. Everyone here at monday.com wants to respect that while showing you at the same time that many others share different beliefs about it and are super positive. I know we're not going to convince you this is a good name - I am aiming to give you and everyone concerned an understanding of where we're coming from. I hope that helps and we truly do appreciate all the feedback from everyone.",0.9934,123
I've received almost identical responses / explanations from 4-5 different reps. Clearly scripted. It's ok guys.  It's a great product. Just poor positioning in my (and every professional I've talked to who are using your product) opinion. Best of luck!,0.9245,48
"Kevin Campbell I completely and totally agree.. clearly said too ! i really like daMonday,  but choosing and insisting to stay on this track shows me there is more company issues internally. A reluctance to seeing other ways.. perhaps this is why they refuse to have different groups with different columns on one board; They site, 'excel export' problems, or 'it'll look messy', instead of actually listening OR simply trying it to see if they are wrong. I try things and prove myself wrong all the time! Sometimes it even makes me look clever !",-0.829,109
Love the product. Very confused about the name change. I think Dapulse was original and much more marketable. Nobody likes Mondays.  :(,0.6213,26
"Needing to add '.com' or 'app' into the name only shows that there's something still not fitting here ! Call it 'MDC' ?? Really ? then call it MDC then !!! If you need to add things to make the name work, then the name DOESN'T WORK. Period.",0.0,61
"Nice video, but oh my god, how did you choose a WORSE name?? ""I've given you a job on Monday... No...  not ON Monday.. on Tuesday but on Monday... No I mean the app Monday not the day....""",-0.7059,49
"Thanks for the feedback Cris. This is why we encourage people to refer to it as monday.com, MDC or the monday app in conversation! That sketch is indeed very funny and with a little context, people can avoid those confusions. Hope that helps!",0.9077,49
"Thanks for the feedback Kevin. We encourage people to refer to it as monday.com, MDC or the monday app in conversation! The comedy possibilities are there of course but hopefully that helps. :)",0.9441,37
"They'd have better calling it ""DBF"" (Done by Friday)..",0.4404,14
"Tried to tell them back when they made the announcement that this was a mistake.  dapulse was unique, ownable, memorable, scalable, and clear.  ""Monday"" is none of those things... but what it does allow is unlimited confusion and wasted energy between clients and teams.  Not to mention they've given their competitors the perfect campaign against them - ""No one likes Monday. That's why there's <insert competitor name>""  I sent them some ""Who's On First?"" scenarios to illustrate my point, but my feedback fell on deaf ears and scripted replies, programmed w/ confirmation bias.

Guy 1:  Hey man, did you complete the task from last week?

Guy 1:  On dapulse!  Remember, it's Monday DOT com now... b/c that makes sense...

"smh.... from one bad name to another... sorry guys.. I love the product, but I think the name shows that you guys might have flexibility issues. Who's on 1st ? If you don't know this reference, then it might be the reason why you have adopted this name.
All the best for the future, I really do love the possibilities of this product,  if you allow the product to naturally expand and listen to customers, you might gain features that you might have otherwise thought unnecessary.",0.9794,97
