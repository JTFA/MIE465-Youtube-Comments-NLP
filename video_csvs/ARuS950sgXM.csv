Sorry, I’m not going to act very nice towards someone who just killed over ten people. As I have said before in other comments, it wasn’t a crime of passions, he PLANNED IT OUT. If it was a crime of passion and wasn’t planned, I would have a MUCH different opinion on this, but that isn’t the case. You are literally sitting here telling me that you feel more bad for a MURDERER than the actual victims that were KILLED. So no, even if I’m ignorant, which I can own up to sometimes, your comment was WAY more ignorant than what I have said. That’s honestly he most disgusting thing I have heard. “Hi, I feel more bad for the man who killed 17 people in a mass shooting than the actual ones who were killed or their families because he has a mental illness! Not his fault! We failed him! He needs help! He had it worse!” You say that they died a quick painless death...and how do you know? Were you there? Did you see that they died immediately? One girl was shot NINE times. One girl (or it may be a guy) is still in the hospital after being shot SEVEN TIMES. Meaning they are laying in the hospital in pain, reliving the moment. You think the parents of these victims are okay? You think they feel nothing? You think they just feel sad and will move on with their life? Do you support rapists? Because it goes by the same logic that you’re speaking of. Many have a mental illness. So it would only make sense that you would. You guys can keep defending him all you want. I’ll be on the actual victims (OF THE SHOOTING) side. 👍

the Obama-era regulation, which was enacted after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School would have required the Social Security Administration to send records of beneficiaries with severe mental disabilities to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The measure would have affected about 75,000 people found mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs.

He was already expelled from school 17 months before his mother passed away in november 2017 , so your mental health evaluations in school, wouldn't have helped. Besides how many psychiatric experts could diagnose a futur mass murderer ?  Are you watching some crime documentaries ? When 5  psychiatric experts give each an different diagnose and evaluation ? How many murderers have been released and killed again ?
He was already diagnosed and was treated with meds a year before the mother passed away since he's always shown signs of violent behavior (torturing animals) attacking neighbor's pets and other kids ,as well as drivers in  their neighborhood.

You wrote ,""Psychopaths and Sociopaths are normal they are no different from you or me so the only way to know is mental evaluations"" ...they have the ability to manipulate , just like he's doing now In court , he acts like he's a poor, traumatized, shy kid who couldn't hurt a fly . I'd like to see the faces of tens of thousands of parents if they heard their kid has a folder at school with the mention, sociopath/ psychopath...!!!!!! After that ,we need some scientists to create the magic cristal ball ,to see WHEN and WHERE they're going to kill or If they'll be ""sleeping"" sociopath/ psychopath.
The question is why was he even accepted In a high school for normal students ? He's always had learning problems, even when he was a little boy.  All he learned In high school, is that he's not normal, that he's a failure and that he'll never be like any other young man .One should believe that this Is enough to put a sicko In a constant state of hatred for other teenagers .
Now I guess we all can agree one one thing... that a 18/19 yo should never have access to  AR ( it's 21 for a handgun, makes no sense at all)
