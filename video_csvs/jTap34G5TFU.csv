The food looks really good.For a blind girl you are real saavy with the camera, far better than I and I am full sighted, yes we see your boy playing.I love your blouse.

He kept bumping to stuff and going to alleys thinking it was the side walk. I decided to follow him to know he is ok where he plans to go. I kept offering help, however he would panic and push me away:/. There was a marathon going on and he of course didn’t know and went by the whole marathon. Everyone was shoook! Everyone offered help and stared running away. I’m hoping he finds himself well😢",-0.4561,119

"Hello, Molly! My name is Daria. I became a fan of yours when I saw the collab you did with Kandee. I was so humbled and felt honoured to be able to get a glimpse of your world. I would like to say thanks for teaching me so much about how to approach a non-sighted person. I didn't know how to approach someone non-sighted without seeming creepy and somehow breach their personal space. I know this isn't a Q & A but... I noticed a tattoo on your wrist and that got me thinking: if you're positively inclined towards tattoos, then how do you feel about dermal implants where you can feel it underneath and read in braille and/or piercings in general?",0.9273,135
"Hey Molly, I've been binge watching your videos for a couple days now and I love your channel!! I noticed in one of your videos you said that as you can't see yourself you rely on people's comments for an indication of that. So, I just wanted to say (and I never comment on YouTube videos) that I think you look really nice with your hair pulled back! (That doesn't mean that you don't look nice when your hair is down, or with bangs or whatever, you always look nice but I was just feeling the hair pulled back haha) :)",0.9241,113
"Hey Molly, love your videos. Not sure if you’ve mentioned this in other videos but in this video you mentioned you no longer have visual memory. That got me curious as I was walking home today. As a sighted person, when thinking of something, I visualize images. For directions, I often visual a google map image of my current location to decide which direction to go. So I am wondering how you, as a blind person may think differently. Do you still conjure up images when you’re thinking of something? Do you have a visual mental map or do you think in a completely different way now? Thank you",0.5362,126

"Hey, Molly! I wanted to ask your opinion on something (I'm hoping you get the chance to read this). I know a lot of people, when they picture disability, they think of things like being blind, or deaf, or even things like Cerebral Palsy and what not. Do you consider mental illness, like depression, a disability? And what would you say to someone suffering from depression and anxiety who literally couldn't work because of it? You have such a successful career and I honestly feel awful that I can't make myself get out of bed when you are thriving with a ""conventional"" disability (I hope the voice-over reads that I put quotations on the word conventional).",0.2621,135

This is probably a stupid question and you may have answered this already but can you cook for yourself?
