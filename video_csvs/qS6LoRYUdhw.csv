Arthur Garwood Delahooke The only reason desomorphine (krokodil) is so dangerous is because it's illegal resulting in it being so impure which is exactly why it gives you the krokodile skin if it were legal and regulated and people could get access to pure desomorphine that would not be an issue and the drug would be much safer it would still be pretty harmful but it would be safer than if is right now and you wont look like a lizard from using it.,0.1254,87

Fentanyl is incredible!! Furanyl fentanyl and butyrfentanyl . I never thought anything would make me feel happier than heroin but then fentanyl up my nose which hits in minutes gave me a new life! Unfortunately it is so powerful and destructive and you never know the percentage so ive had amazing times and 4 days of life just gone and stopping breathing many times. Its amazing but you can't live any kind of normal life on street fentanyl It just creates an illusion and it takes a normal person to shake you out of it for long enough to see what's happening. I crave it 24hrs a day and If I could have it and live a normal life I would! Don't do it it got me in one go unlike heroin that took a while. Now I'm bound to opiate detox drugs daily which in many ways is just as controlling,0.6992,159

They're the nastiest things one can get hooked to, they're the real image of ""drugs"".
But that's where people got it all wrong about what ""drugs"" are.

Even though there are alot of drugs that are more addictive and dangerous as the legal drug cigarettes and alcohol.
Doesn't mean that all of the things that are labelled as ""drugs"" makes it nastier than both of these.
Weed and Psychedelic is one of the example. They're labelled as ""illicit drugs"" back on 60s where the government went ballistic ape shit about anything that's mind altering because of the cold war propaganda. 
Weed and Psychs are a powerful mind altering substences, but are they dangerous ? Are they addictive ?
Not even as addictive and dangerous as caffeine (coffee), let alone cigarettes and alcohol.

"Objectively, Desomorphine is really the most dangerous on the individual level (Krokidil), It's incredibly new so some studies might not even look at it, but it derives its name from the fact it literally rots away at skin and in some more prolonged usage cases rotting away at flesh itself, right down to the bone, at which point it MUST be amputated or else you'll probably die.
It also has the shortest time to kill a person, a ""full"" time addict generally dies in about 2 years due to Its short high, ridiculous side effects, ease to make, and frequent hits in full time abusers.
 The withdrawals of Heroin are awful to begin with, but Desomorphine, while technically isn't outlandishly different, it also gets taken more (Heroin lasts 4-8 hours, Desomorphine lasts 90 minutes) so you end up taking more Desomorphine than Heroin, which can make withdrawals a lot worse because your body demands it more, and more often.
 A hit is really cheap too, in Its peak, it was a tenth the price of Heroin, moreover, you can make it at home, I'm not telling you how here, but if you wish, in a couple days I'm sure anyone who read this far could make it with relative ease.
 So, why isn't it the clear winner of this video?
Well, it's likely due to the fact it isn't used very much, having you flesh rot away until it gets to the bone just isn't something, even addicts are fond of, and whilst it's 8 times stronger than Morphine, it does't last very long, also not something ideal, though cheap (8$ a hit average.)
So, objectively, the worst street drug for you (within means) is Desomorphine, it kills in 2 years (Heroin needs about 3-5) and it's very accessible, however it isn't the most damaging because few people willingly get addicted to it, and the few that do end up with a Desoorphine addiction likely got it from thinking they were buying Heroin, when in reality, it was something very different, and arguable, much more scary.",-0.993,404

You are here because they've been played by a silly DNA molecule, to reproduce for no good reason.
You are here because people are addicted to life,show them tranquility in non-existence and they will always scream ''one more time, just another day''.
