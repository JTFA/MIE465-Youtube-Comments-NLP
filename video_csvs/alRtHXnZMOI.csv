"OLLIEO Yes, they do not care pretty much at all about their creators, only about their platform. They are too dumb to realize that without the creators, the platform will go to (pardon my language) fucking shit. They rarely ever bother to contact the creators once the ToS is changed or anything regarding how the platform works. The creators are YouTube's colleagues and business partners, yet they ignore 98% of them. Such an idiotic strategy.

I could not agree with you more. We are not the victims here, the creators are, specifically the smaller ones (the ones who had not yet benefited from the ""Golden Ages"" of YouTube). The ones like PewDiePie, Smosh, Markiplier, etc. would not be hurt as badly as the ones with less than a million subs. What I dislike about the Trending tab is that it is completely rigged. In order for a channel to get through, it would mean that that channel is either:
A) a channel with the wrong political opinion making a fool of itself
B) a channel with the correct political opinion doing something
C) a channel about movies or songs
D) *rarely* a channel with the wrong opinions but talking about a mainstream topic (like Sargon's video about the latest StarWars movie).

Perhaps there are more conditions but I am not a professional on this matter, this is just what I've observed recently. We would get a better picture of how things are if YouTube cared to share how their algorithm works, what is deemed appropriate and what isn't. But, sadly, that is not the case. Just like you, I too hope for a better future. If one of the biggest platforms the Internet has ever knows falls in such a pathetic way, looking at the bigger picture, who knows what would follow...",0.7428,351

"They probably care at least a little bit. I think they are trying to change things for the sole reason that they are not making as much money as they were before the ""adpocalypse"". But they are going about it the wrong way. They are censoring opinions they do not like by demonetizing them and blacklisting them (making them less easily accessible). Instead, they should focus on making their ToS less vague and more reasonable. Only then, should they enforce the ToS.
I personally think that Susan Wojcicki is one of the worse YouTube CEOs possible for the job/position. She does not understand how the internet works and is digging the platform, along with thousands of jobs, a grave. She tried creating a YouTube channel so that she could better ""connect"" with the actual YouTubers and we saw how well that was received. Lets be honest, the only reason Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of YouTube is because she has connections - not because of ability, intelligence or compatibility.

It's just a 'bot' that looks for specific key words etc and I'm not entirely sure but I'm guessing it checks the videos too adwell as responding to reports that have been made on a certain video. Unfortunately because it isn't an actual person checking it, it just sometimes demonetizes the wrong stuff due to specific words used etc. 

I mean they can't do much about it but they could of atleast fixed it and tested the process properly before actually using it as a way check, censor and demonetize some content.

And yea I completely agree. The CEO has been practically useless as far as I've seen/heard haha",-0.8758,156

But yea I looked into twitch and it is very good, and there seems to be a lot of people moving over to it gradually.",0.4534,77
"johnyk891 yes there are probably way more conditions to consider. But yea couldn't agree with you more on all of that. It seems to be a gradually dying platform unfortunately.maybe they fix their wrongdoings but by the looks of it I highly doubt things are going to be done about all of this. Yea I completely agree, it is genuinely pathetic how they have not done anything about it and are basically just letting the platform die. Well who knows, maybe in the future someone will have a better platform come along for creators to move to. 

YouTube is a ship and that ship is literally sinking right now, looks like people are gonna need to find a new boat haha.",-0.5732,131
"johnyk891 yes they care a little about the site but I'm meaning more about the actual content creators that keep this site going. And yea a lot of it is probably to do with money and all the different advertisers that boycotted the platform which they had used to advertise their product in the past.  

Maybe things will change but tbh it isn't very bad, like it isn't effecting me or many others (viewers) very much really. It's just more the content creators that are getting the worse part, the trending tab I'd pretty much free advertisment for a channel and if a small channel managed to get a good video go almost viral and 'trending' then the trending tab would actually be good for a lot of the youtubers as it gives them some sort of advertisment for their channel. 

Ah well, maybe it will change in the future.",0.9369,163
