"Hello PlayerUnknown, hope you may read this comment.

The new map needs lightning adjustements. 
Previous you had the old map with a new completely changed lightning on the test servers. That was such a great improvement. All the textures looked amazing. Real and detailed.

This new one (Miramar) looks like GTA coloring. Adjust the lightning untill the textures have more volume and colors are more serious. Also, the green of the vegetation looks like the green from the KOTK shitty map. Not the talk about the similarity of the both games lobby area. The sky is too shinny and the effect of bloom is too hard. 

Like for example, when two different textures meet is like theres no edge - no difference between materiales. All look flat and no contrast at all.

Hope you'll do with this new map what you had with the first map last time you had it on test.

My regards,",0.9393,175

Come as you are, and allow Him to wash you and make you new. All He wants is your faith! 
He will do all the rest, so come to Him today. He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so do not let anyone or anything stop you from seeking Jesus today! I know from personal experience, HE WILL SHOW UP! HALLELUJAH!
