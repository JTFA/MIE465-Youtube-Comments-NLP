"Honestly. You could say the exact same thing about any sport out there. With basketball people just run across the court and throw a ball into a basket. Skateboarding, people just stand on a board and push it.

It's one of those things that you have to experience though. Skiing is so much fun, and once you do it you understand how freaking technical and hard some of these tricks are.",0.4364,79

"No. Not really. When Tony Hawk threw the 900, nobody had ever landed one in competition before. Nor had anybody really attempted it. So he really raised the bar with that one.. 

People have been throwing triple corks on skis for a while now but Henrik just did it clean af. He did it right side (which is technically more difficult for most people), held a solid grab, and stomped it clean..",0.1421,84

https://www.recode.net/2018/2/9/16975680/olympics-winter-2018-viewership-down-nbc-rights-pyeongchang

Look at the chart, it shows you actual numbers. Winter Olympics doesn't get nearly as many viewers as the summer olympics do. But I bet you that probably has something to do with access to the sports.

The majority of people in the world don't live in climates that have winter sports like skiing, ice skating, etc. So they don't follow it and can't relate to it as much. Plus a lot of the winter sports are more for the affluent and wealthy.",0.7269,100
