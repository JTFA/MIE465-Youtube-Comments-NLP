""Quantum physics is all about how conscious observation, with or without instruments, forces matter from a multitude of states into one."" 
- *_ABSOLUTELY_* incorrect. You don't know what you are talking about.  And, since I already explained your lack of understanding what is meant by ""observation"", you clearly have no desire to learn the truth of the matter. I'll fix your statement for you: ""Quantum physics is all about how -conscious- observation -with or without instruments- forces matter -from a multitude of- [to change its properties] -into one- .""
As for the double-slit experiment, it doesn't account for the particles and charged fields within the intervening space between the electron gun the observation screen. The experiment was actually a failure due to a lack of understanding the composition of space.  With time comes new understandings. We now know better... sort of.

"If this advances further, then we could technically grow our own robo-humans, and then maybe an actual human.
Yes, the narrator said these brains don't have consciousness, but if I understood correctly, that's because we can't really make them any bigger or wire them correctly. If we made a suit capable of supplying everything a normal brain would need, then we could theoretically grow a mini brain into a normal size, although it still wouldn't be wired correctly.

However, if we managed to link up sensors that feed the brain info like our own (sight, touch, etc.), and hooked them up to the correct parts, the brain may be able to learn and realize what's around it. If we found a way to make the brains learn enough to be able to discern different objects and other such things, we could give it a robotic body and see if it begins to learn how to move around.

Even further in the future, if this succeeds, we could try to put the brain in organic body of artificially grown limbs (Which are already a science, although it's still evolving). If we manage to do this, even if it isn't that well done, it will spell out a future of artificially grown humans, and give us the possibility to make humans with bodies that excel in certain areas; for example, we could grow limbs that are stronger and more durable than your typical human's.

Basically, we could soon begin to grow super humans and make them fight robots for us",0.9761,292

"Word salad.  It's good that you know some key words but, unfortunately, your use of them barely achieves colloquial. When a scientist uses the term ""observation"" they are referring to *_measurement_* .  Measurement necessarily requires an instrument.  Said instrument is itself composed of particles.  Therefore, any attempt to measure, ""observe"", a particle necessitates causing an interaction that causes the properties of the particle to change.  Consciousness has nothing to do with this process. 

Consciousness is ongoing chemical processes.  That's all we can say about it.  The perception there is more to it than that is only a perception.
