If the child doesn't understand or know why you're punishing them, then it won't be effective. Because if you just spank them, then they might just do it behind your back just to spite you. It's much more effective if you grab them by the hand before touching the bleach and yell ""DO YOU WANT TO GET POISONED?! BECAUSE THAT IS POISON! EVERYTHING IS THIS CABINET IS POISON!"", that would both freak them out and it would make them understand that bad consequences would happen to them regardless if they got discovered or not.",-0.9606,110

"Authoritarian and Strict aren't the same thing. As described in the video, Authoritarian parents exercise their power in one direction which means they end up projecting their own inadequacies onto their children. That's why the help with homework is harmful. For example, a child may be getting low scores in Math because they're having trouble reading the numbers. The Authoritarian parent assumes the child is just being lazy. The response is to give them a 20 minute lecture on discipline and commitment then force them to spend outrageous amounts of time doing the problems over and over again. When their is no improvement from the child because the real issue isn't being addressed, the parent becomes more outraged until they finally say it's obvious the child doesn't actually care and the parent gives up.",-0.9328,144

When a child gets a spanking, it should be followed by a talk and a tender embrace, that way the child knows not only the thing they did wrong, but reassurance from the parents that they are loved.

They don't like them spanking the daughters because some people believe it will open up to the idea that getting hit by a man is okay when you do something wrong. Which it's not okay.

"Jacob Jawb You white people are funny. I was whooped from that age till 5th grade. It wasn't about brutal beatings. There was a system. And the discipline never came from a place of anger--that's what you guys don't get. I love my parents (I bet that kid does too)  and when they hit me I knew it was cause I fucked up. It was alway something they had previously told me not to do and had warned me of the consequences should I CHOOSE to disobey. I made a decision to be a little shit and did it anyways so when the spanking came I knew full well this was my own doing. I was always a smartass since birth and I guarantee that if my parents tried that white people shit on me--I would've made them my bitches. They once tried to ground me and I was like ""okaaay...well I'm gonna do it anyway...really the only you can stop me is by force"" so we land back to discipline. It is a useful tool at a certain age and if done properly. And sorry that I keep slamming white peoples cause I do have white friends who know what's up.

There's a HUGE difference between a spanking and a beating. Spanking a kid will help alot if the cause was spank worthy. A beating is abuse where it's unwarranted and that crosses the line.

"This is basically every parent from Asia... Those people are fucken crazy about raising their kids.  I guess that's why Japan has a ridiculous number of virgins and stay at home deadbeats... They were never able to develope properly and depend solely on their parents.  I worked in Japan for 3 years and it is amazing how many guys stay at home in their late 30's and even 40's without ever having a relationship.  They get room service and everything done for them at such an old age. It's really disturbing, not to mention some kids sleep with their parents till they are well into their teens.",-0.3167,119
