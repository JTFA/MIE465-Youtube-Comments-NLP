Today it's such a great feeling to have our very own hero. Someone to admire and aspire to be, not just for accomplishments, but for the dreams. This time it's not the Astronaut or Cosmonaut! This time it's just a person with vision and drive to pursue his dreams of the future . Someone we can relate to... his speeches are not perfect, he isn't orchestrated... he is funny, intelligent, a person with quirks, a person you'd maybe want to hang out with or have a beer or 8 with and talk about the Matrix.

I always thought that was going to be a big problem given the loading sequence for the superchilled oxygen and the limited time (a few hours) it could stay in the tank before needing to be offloaded.  I think the estimate for bringing a crew on-board and ready for launch is at best 2 hours, so they'd have to load the tank (not just maintain the levels) while the crew was in the capsule.
