"I've already watched a lot of it in the Mosaic app and it's a great experience. At the end of an episode, you pick between the next two possible episodes and create your own path of the story. Then you can go back and watch the ones you didnt choose at first. I havent finished all the episodes yet, but wow this is pretty good. It definitely feels long because it's all layed out and still, pure drama and crime mystery. But acting and directing is as good as the trailer shows. I recommend trying the app out. While you watch, you get to read news articles, pictures, or 2 minute flashbacks that help you understand what is going on. Really unique way of immersing into a story, which in this case is very interesting.",0.9847,151
