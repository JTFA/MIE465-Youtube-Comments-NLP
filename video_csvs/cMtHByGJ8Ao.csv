"""You never notice glass unless it's broken."" that defines my life because no one in my school notices me unless im crying or unless i look like im having a bad day. im invisible to everyone unless im broken. i remember back in 6th grade, must have been about the 3rd week, my friends and i were just walking around doing nothing at all, then a group of the ""popular"" ppl came over and started picking on one of my friends. they just completely ignored me while my other friend were telling them to fuck off. eventually, i just started crying. silent at first, but it escalated as the argument kept going. no one noticed me walk away crying to hide, not wanting to cry in public. they only noticed when i went home early in around 4th hour because if i stayed, everyone would see me cry. they asked me what was wrong and if ill be ok. i just left, not saying anything to them. 

this song really helps me. it kinda told me to take a chance and speak up.",-0.8554,208

Even though I'm a very social person  I still relate to this song a lot. It's a bit different for me though. I'm the glass that has to pull myself together and look like I'm OK. I've always been the rock for my family and friends. There's no one ever there to fix my cracks or broken pieces. I don't cry in front anyone because I need to be strong for everybody else but no one is there to be strong for me but me. It's probably too often that I get the overwhelming urge to cry just because I never do. I always have to put on a mask for everyone around  me and I wear it so often it just never comes off. I'm tired of having to plaster a fake smile on my face and no one noticing that I'm broken but I'll do it again a million times if it means I can prevent my loved ones from feeling like this.,0.8327,174
