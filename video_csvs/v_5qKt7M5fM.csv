CinemaScore is a very flawed system too! Why? They only poll people that are coming out of the theatre on opening (in other words die hard fans) also those fans can't go home and collect their thoughts. I CAN'T throw my opinion into the mix on CinemaScore because of how limited their polling is. CinemaScore is literally just fan snap judgment reactions of people that just exited the theatre.",-0.636,78

Lastly I just want to say, I personally am a easy to please and forgiving as far a movies go. Hey, I think Rouge One and Force Awaken are great. Even, the prequels for me are good. For me to have that strong reaction, there must be something really wrong about this movie, I tell you, believe me. Just read the comments section. That a hell a lot of fake people. For the Critics to have such high praise of TLJ and the fans on the opposite. The critics must be dishonest. Can professional movie critics still be trusted? When their financial livelihood may be at stake. When they rely on the developer for early access and connections to the important people.

"I'm glad you enjoyed the movie for me it left me with no real interest in the characters left standing at the end of the movie. For me it never really gave me anything new in their development apart from maybe Kylo Ren.
I'm surprised that you claim that John sees the film as an ""excellent extension of the star wars universe"" as all I heard was ""Porg's. I love Porg's and you will too, you all need to get one"".

I would be interested to hear why you feel the way you do about the film, it would be nice to read how you see it has expanded on and connects to the lore, history and even in what way it fills in the blanks left from the story arc of the Force awakens for you. How you feel it expanded on the character development of the now main protagonists and why we should care about their stories moving forward.

A lot in this film for me was more about merchandising than anything else, I'm sure a lot of questions will be answered in the way of novels, comics and tv shows. To me the film in parts lent more towards setting up a Disney merchandising machine than any story moving forward.

That being said I still think it was an ok sc fi film but stand by my view that it was a very bad Star Wars movie, perhaps with time and listening to others opinions might start to change that but as of now I have little interest in episode IX.

As a movie it was fine. Maybe even good in parts but as an extension of the star wars universe it was just dreadful.
Yes the torch needs to be passed on (or saber) but to just sweep away, not just what JJ had set up in TFA.

"People need to understand Cinemascore. Cinemascore is calculated by surveying audiences as they are immediately leaving the movie. You must understand that this is a time and a scenario that makes people VERY likely to give high scores. Most cinema scores are in the A range. A score in the Bs is not great depending on the genre, and anything C or lower means box office nightmares are ahead. Only like 19 films have EVER gotten an F cinemascore... it's pretty much a triumph to make a movie so bad that it gets an F score. ""mother!"" was the most recent F-rated Cinemascore. They are almost all crap horror movies.
Cinemascore does not tell you much about the quality of a film, except that most Bs and under range from not great to horrible... but sometimes a great cult classic will end up with a B or C grade.
The Cinemascore is a good box office predictor. You can fairly accurately judge the box office drop off using the cinemascore combined with the genre of the movie. So... most Horror movies are in the B range. So a B is actually good for a Horror movie on Cinemascore. But for a big budget blockbuster movie, anything under A- is not good. 
Here is an interesting note. The only MCU movie with a B is Thor with B+. The DCEU has only Man Of Steel and Wonder Woman with A- and A scores, but the other 3 DCEU films are in the Bs.
Also. It predicts box office legs... not overall box office. So you take the score, and you apply it to the opening weekend to figure out the end result more or less. So... you can get movies with high cinema scores, that not many people went to see opening weekend... so that predicts, that profits will not fall too quickly, but that might not matter if the starting number is already low. On the flipside, you can have a movie with a bad cinemascore, that made a ton of money on the opening weekend, that will have a steeper drop in profits, but it still makes bank because it started so high. BVS and Suicide Squad are good examples of good profits but weak scores and fast dropping box office numbers. Justice League is an example of a weak start and a pretty weak score. 
Also, A+ is Rare. Only like 52 movies had A+ as of 2011. Avengers is the only MCU movie to get A+. Coco and Wonder are the most recent A+ movies. Lots of Pixar movies get A+. Also thiings like E.T., Return Of the King, Titanic, Passion of the Christ, Schindler's List, etc.",0.7721,518
"Perhaps you may understand a bit more if it was put into a context that was more fitting to you.
Maybe you are a football fan that follows a team. So imagine that for many years you have followed them faithfully, reading every article attending every match all over the country. Collecting every program spending hours trying to get that elusive last sticker for you album. To see that team grow and slowly climb the leagues as you yourself grow and perhaps introduce a new generation to the team. For them to make it all the way to the FA cup final only to lose and then people turn around to you and say.
 ""O well its only a game"". 
Or maybe you followed and fell in love with the Spice Girls just to be told when they split up ""O well it was only a silly manufactured Girl Group"".

This is a well made movie that is filled with missed opportunities and letdowns! Watching this movie was like having someone take a shit in my heart.

What about the other students of Luke that left with Kylo. Neither Rey nor Kylo received any training! The entire movie occurs over the coarse of like twenty-four hours which makes character development almost non existent! I Spent the whole movie waiting for that great moment that never came(excluding the throne room fight). Did anyone else notice that there is not a lightsaber battle in this entire movie? No two lightsabers come into contact with one another! Where the hell is Luke's green lightsaber? I enjoyed the force awakens to spite its many flaws. I never want to see this movie again and I no longer care about episode nine. I never thought I would say these words. Ryan Johnson should not be making his own trilogy if this is what he thinks star wars should be. I also cannot believe all the critical denial that is happening around this movie because critics are afraid to offend the creators and not get invited to the next flashy premier.

"What I said was just that the existing shows can't be pulled from the service without Disney buying them back. As for whether they could just continue the shows seamlessly on their own service in 2019 *without* buying the existing shows, I doubt that. Netflix co-owns the existing shows, meaning that they therefore co-own all elements of those shows that aren't directly tied to or included in the license (eg: writing, design, music, etc). Disney simply getting the license back doesn't necessarily give them rights to the things that were previously created on the basis of that license. Like, for example, anyone can make a Frankenstein movie because the novel is in the public domain, but the specific makeup design associated with Boris Karloff's portrayal of the monster is owned by Universal - it's a design element unique to the film, it's not contained in the source material.",0.2846,167

With The Last Jedi there is an angry faction of the fan base that seems to want to vent their frustration through online forums and polls, especially in the wake of overwhelmingly positive reviews. Justice League has a more bloated audience rating  because it's fan base was motivated save it from the critical thrashing it took.
