The point is you don't have to make much of an effort to eat healthy. There are so many places you can get low-cost, low-calorie, healthy meals. Go out to lunch with friends in the US and try to find a restaurant with more than a few healthy dishes. In Japan it's every other restaurant.",0.8807,64

It's super convenient to go to a market in America and just put tons of groceries in your car so it's easier to get fat here..imagine walking a mile or two with your groceries (I would go to health food stores in Japan and not normal convenient stores so they were a bit further lol),0.9599,170
