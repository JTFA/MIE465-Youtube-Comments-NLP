"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!

The Lord came down from heaven in the Person of Jesus Christ to die, and 3 days later, rise again for all of us!
He redeemed us! Hallelujah!

So friends, Jesus LOVES you! He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you.

The Word says that God so loved the world, HE gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life! (John 3:16 paraphrased)

The Lord is FOR us, not against us!

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!
He will forgive you, make you new, and deliver you from the judgement coming for this earth.

Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him! (John 6:37 paraphrased)
So come to Him today, by calling upon Him!

You don't need a fancy prayer, all you need is sincere words from the heart, and mustard seed size faith.
All those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

Shalom, my friends!",0.9913,211
