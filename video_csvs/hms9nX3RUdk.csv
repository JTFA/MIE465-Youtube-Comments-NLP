"100% suggest a Pentax K1000 for a 35mm film camera. When I studied photography at college, it was the camera we were all told to buy for our film unit. They're so easy to use, and very cheap.

"Hi! I am really glad to hear that, I hope it all works out for you the way you planned, with some nice surprises on the way just to spice it up :) So what I did for my anxiety is a few life style changes, I try to take really good care of myself as my anxiety creeps up when I am tired and under a lot of stress. I took up yoga, I try to sleep regularly and eat healthy, walk a lot, take mindful brakes (sit and concentrate on my breathing, like small meditation brakes - there is a great app called Headspace to help you out if it is something you find useful, it really helps me calm down and focus). And I tried CBT -  cognitive-behavioral therapy, I went for a few sessions, and even tho I did not quite click with the counselor,  I really learned a lot on how to brake away from ""bad"" brain patterns that lead to anxiety and panic attacks. I did have to pay for it myself, but I found that investing in good mental health is much more beneficial then shoes :D if you can get it for free via your social/medical security.  I hope this helps! P.S. my anxiety is not gone away completely, I still have some ""not ideal"" days, but it got much much better and I feel like it is not heavily influencing my decisions and my life anymore.",0.993,277

"I don't think it is ever too late, also for many people setting goals has little or no relevance, they still have a desire to strive and do what makes them happy. I was always a bit of a control freak, some times I think that going with the flow is such a blessing. Also, there are so many things you cannot really control, you can just hope they turn out fine. I did reach many of my milestones but along that way my parents got ill, my grandpa died, I struggled with money a lot, with anxiety quite a lot, and there were many times that were rough... but you wiggle your way trough fighting and doing your best - plans or no plans, lists or no lists. :) good luck!",0.5371,148

"I worry that I haven’t achieved as much as I should have and I am nearly 28. However listening to your list I feel much better. You want to save a deposit and buy your own home, I have just done this and move in February, I will be getting my first sofa around that time. You want to own a pet and I have been lucky enough to have my guinea pig for 6 years but he died last year so I will be looking to get a new pet before I’m 30, maybe a dog or cat. You want to visit India and Ghana and do more charity work. This year I did volunteer work and research in Kenya and last year I went to Sri Lanka for a month to work at the local hospital. I also went to Thailand which was on my travel bucket list and I’ve added more countries on that list now. Buying my first car and learning to drive was on my list and I managed to do that at 24. I wanted to get a degree, which I achieved this year at 27. I also wanted to do a lot more charity work so 3 years ago I joined St. John ambulance and I’ve done a lot of local health related volunteering events. I feel much better about my life after reflecting and actually recognising how much I’ve already done. Good luck to you Lucy! And to anyone else readying this far into my comment...

I keep in mind that I probably won't get rid of anxiety for good but, like you said, as long as it's not controlling my life anymore I will be satisfied. 
Congratulations on all of your achievements (even a pregnancy, wow!) really amazing that you've reached so many goals!

"Just a wild couple of suggestions - if you want some good production software, the ones I was introduced to and would very highly recommend due to their flexibility and being cheap - if you want customisable music production software, give Cockos REAPER a spin. You can lay it out practically however you want and it's quite easy to pick up (plus teaches you a few tricks you can transfer to other software like ProTools, Cubase, Logic or Audition as you prefer). You get 60 days for free and after that it's not much. For radio, software such as Mixxx and Sourcefabric's Airtime might be a good place to start. Both are free to download (unless you'd prefer to pay for Airtime Pro for then to host the server) - otherwise maybe start with your own solo podcast to see how you'd get on, see how you feel about it and start out volunteering for community or hospital radio and work your way up.

As an Indian, I think I'd love to meet non-Indians who actually know stuff about India before coming here, because it's a bit off-putting when people want to come here only to see the Taj Mahal, or all the popular spots.
If you are going to come to India, I would really suggest visiting a city/state that does NOT speak Hindi. Like my own city, Chennai.
But that's just something I always say whenever any non-Indian says they want to visit India. So take that piece of advice for what that's worth.

And speaking of films, you could either use the AFI list which is amazing, or this one : ( https://letterboxd.com/truefilmreddit/list/watch-this-not-that-afi-top-100-edition/detail/ ) which is kind of like an alternate AFI list.

I'm interested to see how your reading habit goes next year, because I've made a very similar annual goal for myself, because I used to read a lot, but then I didn't read much the last year. So I want to get back to reading, and I've also kind of made a video about that, and hopefully I'll see a positive change next year as well.

Uh… yeah. And I guess this isn't 30. But just the 1. If I manage that, I think it'll already be great but…

I want to survive? I guess? Well that's the goal, for sure. Live to be 30. Cause… yeah. Right now and for the past [too many] years my depressed brain has been convinced it wouldn't make it past the last 20s… surely never past 27… or 28 or something. But you know. 27. Anyways.
Yeah.

Dark.

But hopefully I'll manage.

And maybe I'll even get to add things on that.

Actually, maybe finishing this album my dad keeps asking me to finish (he wrote lyrics, I wrote music, never recorded shit). So… yeah? 2. 2 before 30. Why not. Why not.

… and maybe get my stories finally out there. However. Books, films, on some website. However. I just want to finally finish them and share them.

IT WOULD BE THE MOST AMAZING THING THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN TO ME IF YOU'LL VISIT HERE ❤ we have really pretty and unique places like Jerusalem and the dead sea and deserts in the south and snow in the north and all of that in just one (really small) country and that would be so amazing if you only could see it irl.
I'm actually not kidding and I'm the serious-est I've ever been, when I say that you could contact me maybe?? and I could show you all of the unique places in Israel. I live in Tel Aviv so it's really in the center of Israel, and if you'll come (which you totally should), I would be so much more than happy to give you a tour in here.
Love you 💙💙💙",0.9717,156

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
