"Austin Patterson, that argument looks conspiracy-ridden, and it looks as if it is a copy paste. May I ask what the source is? A better analogy would be toll lanes (sometimes called express lanes), where one or multiple lanes of a freeway are reserved for those who pay a fine. This is used to gain income in some US states, and it is sometimes criticized because it can leave commuters who can’t pay the price with more traffic. Under net neutrality (by definition), toll lanes would not exist, as all traffic must be treated equally. Net Neutrality does not limit the size of the freeway or the bandwidth of the internet, it merely defines neutrality and promotes adherence to it.",0.5994,139

"I've been watching the show MindHunters and it's an awesome show! It got me interested in psychology again and between episodes I was looking up the real interviews and reading about the thinking of psychopaths and then I managed to catch the first episode of the second season of MindField which explored the trolly problem thought experiment which you should look into, first episode's free! Anyway, it made me really sit up when after the woman who voted no and gave a very thoughtful and moving speech, one that moved me to tears and that's getting harder and harder in this... Trump era? There's so much tragedy now that I'm becoming numb as if I'm in shock to it all, so it meant a lot to see someone so impassioned speak about her concerns which also showed me she has been listening to us all. But then that Ajit guy chucklingly said ""I'll put you down as a no then"" and then the laughter? People without empathy who can find joy in a tragedy are called psychopaths. They aren't all bad people, they simply lack the ability to put themselves in other's shoes. Ajit displays a lot of these tendencies with his big cup and his responses to the public. It's feeding his ego, the most important thing to a psychopath. But of all those who laughed with him, who are they? I hope not people in positions of power, I believe representatives should pass a psychopath test, both MRI and written before being allowed to take a government job because there's an alarming amount of people in positions of power who show these signs. Now, not all who laughed would be psychopathic and all of this is purely speculation from someone who's learned psychology as a hobby on and off as a teen. I possess well above average knowledge of psychology in comparison to those who haven't actively read any books on the subject, but I'm nowhere near an expert. I'm an old amateur that can only say in faith that there is something to the study of our brains and behavior and that we need to stop stigmatizing anyone who wants to find some help. 

Oh, and some other advice I think everyone in the world should take is this. Learn about confirmation bias and do your best to not let it be your guide. If you don't know what it is, once you learn you may realize that almost everything you know as true in your life might be due to confirmation bias. A good example is if you are part of a religion, then ask yourself how much you know about other religions. Besides negative things, you've heard. I mean actual facts you've studied by yourself, and if your answer is that you never thought of doing such a thing, well that's because of confirmation bias. In a nutshell, it's the fact that all of our brains prefer information that supports what we already think and will usually completely ignore any information that doesn't fit with what you already want to think. My favorite book on the subject is ""You are not so smart"" by DAVID MCRANEY.  Not only is it informitive and gives lots of examples from studies and such, but is written in an entertaining and funny where need be way. Oh, and is also very humbling, whenever I recommend it I always get ""I don't want a read a book that's calling me stupid."" But that's not the intention. Anyway, I wrote enough. I'm obviously pretty upset over this decision, I just saw that 3 of the 5 people did not care at all about the concerns of the public and the concerns of professionals all saying no. and calling this an Obama era when it was agreed upon by both sides to stop this very thing from happening... That's just stirring up racism. It just so happened that he was president when it happened, he didn't do it. It was both republicans and democrates working toghether that created net neutrality. But this Ajit guy is living in his own bubble and should not be in a place of power. Anyone finding joy in upsetting and probably screwing over millions should not be in power.",0.9596,776

"It is not single voice it is the voice of million people
If you discard my statement future of isp, costumer, developer in my view no one get affected highly
You can charge costumer network maintenance charge( 5 to 15 dollar separately in bill) by (enforcing net neutrality)

Developer:who is like Google ,Facebook,WhatsApp
Netflix's,YouTube and many more so on.


Middle man or isp: isp who supply developer content to consumer. And consumer pay for it.


Consumer: consumer involment in internet is due to developer only .if there is no developer consumer will not use internet


Middle man or isp dual game: the main role of isp is to deliver the content of developer to consumer.

But isp like to play developer role also with his own

Content creation so this lead to real clash between

Isp and developer and more traffic generates


What happen if no net neutrality


1)no new developer come forward 


2)we stick to old developer technology


3) new developer technology can be created but only like Google or gaint company can do it.


4)no new young generation developer cannot create independently


5)isp show they content


6)more software industry and tech industry get destroyed because most of technology is internet based if they is no net neutrality consumer will not spend in new technology  


5) technology is connection of hardware and software both will get more set back like stone age

 

What happen if  net neutrality available


1) more new developer

 

2) fast technology growth


3)from higher to low consumer internet reaches


4)more new company realted software and hardware get higher

 

5) less cost

 

6) one disadvantage to isp is higher network maintenance


How to resolve this issue

 

1) isp should not act as developer directly or indirectly


2) isp should treat all developer equal in all forms


3) developer should be charged by isp in any form


4)isp only role is to deliver developer content to consumer


5) [isp can charge consumer the consumer for 

Network maintenance like 5 to 10 dollar a month for every consumer separately] :important


6) isp should not block any content 


7)isp should not slower the speed of internet

 

8) isp should not support any particular developer in any manner

9) no fup or also called as data cap plan must be
Banned




Simple forumal


1) hardware+software=developer


2) developer+ isp=internet


3) developer ( earning)+ isp (earning) by = consumer


(Without consumer developer and isp useless)

final statement:
1)Newer competition make newer innovation if net neutrality stopped no newer competition and innovation slow down

2)For example pen is a writing material. I can write good and bad and even I can  used to pinch others.
The pen cannot do it on it is own. The pen is operated by the user. So I cannot banned pen. Are to put the limition to the user 1) when to use the pen 2) where to use the pen 3) who can use the pen
This is not pen fault it is a human fault for his mistake I cannot punish the pen. For one person mistake I cannot punish whole human
Like that internet is tool .the mistake by oneuser . I cannot punish whole user .so I have teach the user how to use it properly.internet is not created naturally. it is created  by million of users .with out them it cannot be created.today also internet growing  and it will be growing . If net neutrality is stopped and internet growth stops.
I am a middle man of judgement I am speaking in the natural law not in artificial law I am speaking for growth of American motherland 
So read my statement make it as decision then no one will get prombelm.

3)I have speaked in every corner .Take my points in to to your consideration. My points do not affect the the country, developer,isp and consumer in any manner
My turn is over this is your turn.One pillar cannot hold the building all the four pillar must support .so all the them should join hand and save free open internet. Do not waste this invertion",0.9934,782

"Net neutrality policy was put into being by the Obama
administration. Designed to open the USA to the entire world to include all
terrorist states. it worked. It worked well for North Korea as it enabled them
to infiltrate our web with ease. It enabled ISIS to infiltrate our web with
ease. even Russia jumped in both feet. net neutrality is the label used to make
this happen.The definition given for net neutrality is the exact opposite of
the real definition. We have been tricked and it appears the deep state is
getting away with it. Thank God they have been trumped by Trump. Look at it
like this; It is like leaving the front door to your house open with a sign, go
ahead, no one will ever know. It is impossible for Facebook or Verizon or cable
companies to use less space on the net because of the enormously high volume of
traffic. They need high octane and not regular to even keep up. Cable companies
already sold internet services in incremental speeds, the more you paid, the
faster you went. Don't know if you noticed but internet speeds are now erratic. A
tractor trailer rig uses more space on the road than a small car and one always
gets held up behind one. The truck gets a turbo charger and now is able to keep
the pace. The car gets a turbo charger and goes blazing speeds. Go back to

The internet was running great before net neutrality it was actually running way better. Since net neutrality internet innovation has died off hard af. Literally every great website was made before net neutrality. Now everyone please tell me what websites blew up after net neutrality I will wait. Net neutrality just put a blockade up for businesses to thrive. Net neutrality kills business. The free market regulates better then the government can. Go to your local DMV and experience socialism and government being in control. The government does a horrible job. The free market breeds the best that's a fact.,0.9565,110

"The reason why their is no more N/N is because the internet is taking over cable. All my shows I stream #no commercials. Cable is obsolete and the networks know it. So whats the next best thing for them, to make the internet run like a cable company. Thankfully as an American I live in a country that has the best internet/ service in the world Lithuania.

"This is what I don't understand about our ""political system"" the votes tell it all here yet it gets passed? So much for ""the people"" we are all told lies here to believe our country is so great, if it was then why do we have to deal with continuous bullshit that we cannot control? There are software out there that can bypass this just so everyone knows so if you don't want to be a victim of this BS, do what you have to do as a person.
