"Father God, through Jesus Christ, the Alpha and the Omega, the Creator of ALL THINGS loves you so very much. He wants you to come to Him with all of your weaknesses: physical, emotional, and spiritual. Rest in the comfort of His Presence, remembering that nothing is impossible with Jesus. Pry your mind away from your problems so you can focus your attention on our Lord. Understand that He is able to do immeasurably more than all you ask or imagine. When anxiety attempts to wedge its way into your thoughts, remind yourself that Jesus Christ is your Comforter and your Shepherd. Give yourself completely to Him this very moment. Though it may feel frightening, the safest place to ever be is in the loving  care of Jesus Christ. ❤️❤️❤️  (Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.91,198

"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends! 

Repent and put your faith in The Lord!!

He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him. (John 6:37 paraphrased) 

So come to Him today!
The Lord Loves you!

He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

The Word says in John 3:16, that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. Hallelujah!

Friends, this is the Greatest News! God is not against us! He is for us!
This is why He came down in the Person of Jesus Christ to die and 3 days later, rise again for all of us!

He did this out of sheer love for us! Don't let the devil stop you from approaching The Lord today!

All those that call upon Jesus will be saved! (Romans 10:13, paraphrased)

He will forgive you, wash you, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

All you need is mustard seed faith and sincere words from the heart. I assure you, He will hear. 

Shalom, friends.",0.9956,235
