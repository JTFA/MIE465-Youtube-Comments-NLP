Don't really know how to apply that to my life in general but helps in stressful situations.

"Summary of video:
1. Instead of prioritizing each task individually (which can waste a lot of time if in large volume), just make priority buckets to group the tasks. Dont look for a perfect order. Executing tasks chronologically or randomly can be a better alternative sometimes.
2. Instead of avoiding interruptions, just group them together.  E.g. work on a task for a full hour and then spend 15 minutes to deal with interruptions. Then go back to work for another full hour. Repeat the process.",-0.4588,102

"This theory only applies to people that dont have time critical jobs. As a business owner of a metal fabrication shop if I just blindly just went down a list of emails or tasks it would end up adding so much time to all of my projects that I would miss critical deadlines  and unspoken time windows to return quotes back to clients. 
For instance one email may say I need this quote by 2 pm that may require me to call a get quotes from 3 suppliers first then spend another hour or two putting it together.  If I jist go through my emails and just call back clients without prioritizing them I may miss a window I had to get the ball rolling with a supplier so he can get back to me later that day. You  have to get all the info first then establish which tasks take  time but don't t require constant attention so those can be started first then other tasks that can be solved and completed quickly durring the other time so no time is spent waiting for a result or answer from others.  You may find that one of the last emails you open require you to down load or copy a large file or request it from someone else that if it was found in the beginning you would have been zipping through the others while waiting for that one to get done.",-0.1992,248
