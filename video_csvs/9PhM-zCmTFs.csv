"Is it me or does the animation look a bit cheaper than usual? Sometimes it looks like Adobe Animate (formerly Flash) motion tweens were used for some of the animation. This causes the animation to look more artificial and flat looking when things move too perfectly and don't rotate in 3D space. I guess to produce more shorts, some sacrifices had to be made. I'm ok with this as long as it doesn't look too cheap.
To make my point, notice how Simon's head is pretty much always in a three-quarter angle no matter how much he moves. Even when he looks up and down, his head never leaves that angle. Also notice the small squash and stretch effects. They look kinda artificial like a scale property has been applied to some parts of the characters combined with motion tweens.",0.91,154

Jesus died and rose again the 3rd day so that we may live. He did this out of sheer love. So find comfort in this truth! The God of the universe came to save us! Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus! Amen.
