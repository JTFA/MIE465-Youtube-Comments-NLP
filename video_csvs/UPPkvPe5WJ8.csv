"#1 I welcome Rey Unrelated, and I hoped this trilogy to end with end of the Skywalker bloodline. A moving bitter sweet end for the Skywalker Saga, it's something I may like a lot. I can't care less about the KOR and I wasn't particulary intrigued by Snoke backstory. I think it may be a good idea to kill him off to be replaced by Kylo. So it's not that TLJ went vs my headcanon. It's that is a bad movie. I liked Luke's arc, but he almost trying to kill Ben Solo while sleeping is totally out of character. And something you don't need for the sake of the story.

Now he's traumatized by Luke and even more played by Snoke, then it's him playing Rey and we discover he's been plotting all the time because he seeks power. Far too much to be logical at all.

Luke didn't league Rogue Squadron in the first one, he was Rogue 5. Luke and Wedge were the only survivors of Rogue Squadron in that fight, and since Luke destroyed the Death Star, he was given the initial promotion to Rogue Leader in Episode V. In Episode VI, Wedge is Rogue Leader.

Princess Leia was a more pro-feminism character than Rey. She was a princess who never cracked under interrogation in torture, took over her own rescue operation and saved Luke, Han, and Chewbacca, is a top strategist for the Rebellion, and actively aids multiple missions, including escaping the first Death Star, escaping Hoth, escaping Bespin, and blowing up the shield generator for the second Death Star.",-0.9709,145

"Chris Wong Rian Johnson in this movie, “let the past die, bury it if you have to”. Leia isn’t the same. She’s all of a sudden a force God who can survive the cold vacuum of space and being violently sucked out of a spaceship. Luke didn’t evolve as a character, he was treated like an archetype to be deconstructed. This story shouldn’t go on forever. The story was the fall of this golden child deemed to be the chosen one, finally redeemed by his son’s fervent hope in him.

Last words of Anakin

Luke: “I’ve got to save you”
Anakin: “You already have, Luke. You were right. You were right about me. Tell your sister, you were right.”

Now that redeemer of his father is now the cause of Kylo Ren’s creation? Heck no. Even the dialogue was just so off.

Last Words of Luke

Luke: “See You around, kid”
Kylo Ren: “Noooooooo”

Luke then meaninglessly fades out on the island planet for no reason.

This story line shouldn’t have tied in to the first 6 movies, because now, there was no fall of the empire, we never see the fruits of the original trilogy, there was no return of the Jedi, and now original characters are used to shield viewers from seeing how bad these movies are. C3PO gets one line. R2D2 inactive for whole movie except to project some shit and power back down (again), Chewbacca is background comic relief. Ackbar died off camera, should’ve replaced Holdo in the movie. Nien Nunb is only in background shots. No reason for them to even be there man...",-0.8591,337

I have had fever dreams which were more entertaining than this dreck. As a life-long Star Wars fan, I am beyond disappointed. This film is not only terrible, it ruins all the films that have gone before it. It's a total disaster. Not in my wildest imagination could I have envisioned this disaster they dare to call a movie. What Disney and Rian Johnson have done to this franchise is simply tragic. The Last Jedi is a total failure of basic storytelling. It does nothing to bridge plot lines or further expand character development already established in The Force Awakens. In fact, it ignores everything and acts as though the previous movies never existed. Luke Skywalker is now a cynical old hermit who tells stupid jokes and milks the teats of space dinosaurs for nourishment (I'm not joking). Rey, the protagonist gives a lifeless performance (particularly at the beginning) and further becomes an enigma in this film. We learn nothing new about her. Princess Leia now flies in space like Mary Poppins (SMH). Rian Johnson conveniently forgets that bombs can't be dropped in the vacuum of space because science shows us that there's no gravity in space (I learned that in the first grade). Snoke, the all powerful bad guy, was just time filler. There's no back story, not even an attempt to let the viewer understand more about this powerful evil character and his motives. So what do they do...they kill him off, and then do the same with Captain Phasma. The attempt to try to make this film socially relevant by pushing a (peta / green peace) social agenda (save the space animals at the casino) made this movie cringeworthy. Not to mention the blatant pandering to Asian Americans by forcing us the totally unnecessary PC story line of the Asian girl teaming up with the Black guy to do only god know what. It was a total waste of time. From the onset, they made General Hux look like a fool with his bad acting and the misplaced humor that totally distracts from the story. Bad on all fronts. Laura Dern gives a performance that would make a cadaver proud. Rian Johnson took a dump on the Star Wars legacy and effectively destroyed it. This movie represents the end of the franchise, at least for me. I will no longer pay good money to watch anything related to Star Wars. Great effects will never cover up bad story telling. TLJ is bad storytelling at it's worst. they made Luke Skywalker look like a fool.and a murderer , he will get zapped by the emperor to save his dad from the darkside , a dad he knew for all of about 15mins, vrs wanting to kill his newfew that hes known his whole life on a hunch, does this sound like luke skywalker? seriously what was the fucking point of snoke? leia flying through space like superman is just embarassing Rey with ZERO training and no Heritage is able to fight as good as yoda, WTF if you dont think that is a mary sue, its because you dont understand wtf a mary sue is period luke went out like a bitch, the writing for his charchter was fucking terrible, Disney should be boycotted for this complete bullshit as for me i will never buy anything with the disney or star wars logos on them again, this is going to cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, hope it was worth it to push there feminist SJW agenda, F'off Disney",-0.9982,689

They even killed off Luke for no reason. Was he just really tired? He seriously just fades in the breeze like a hot fart, and it's so unexpected in a bad way. His last words are ""See you around, kid"", which makes you think that he'll confront Kylo again in the future. He didn't teach Rey a damn thing. He never rose up from his adversity, because in the end he did what he set out to do, which was die on that stupid, merchandise-infested planet. What is this future? Han and Luke are dead. Leia is alive, but actually dead. Ackbar was killed off screen. R2D2 is relegated to projecting shit then turning off. Force Ghosts can control lightning. This is madness.

Rian Johnson said in an interview that from the start, he knew Luke had to die in order to shift focus to the new characters, and that's a terrible method for writing. You can't just kill off characters because they take away from the main characters. That just means you suck at writing the main characters.",-0.997,234

Thats like saying I dont like Rey and Finn's dynamic, cause it's multiracial... That's stupid...and Im gonna shut that foolishness down RIGHT now. Now...I also get that her sister gave her life to save the resistance and I LOVED that...but Rose and the whole casino act and her saving Finn and loving him and all...was useless to me. Sure - she helped him gain his courage to fight and do for others...but she was just a character that wasnt really needed. And if Finn would have tried to sacrifice himself...but then jump out before the crash (because it has not roof - he COULD HAVE jumped out...), I would have loved it even more. Even the sacrifice would have meant more to me...but the whole arc with her and him -I FELT- wasn't needed.",0.9483,202

"Illini Fan Kylo Ren was only character that was sorta developed from this movie. But okay, snoke was supposed to be stronger then Vader and the emperor and gets killed like nothing, and no backstory on him, how did he learned the force, where was the knights of Ren, why would Luke try to kill his nephew even if he felt the dark side of the force he wouldn't try to kill in his sleep he would try to save him, it's not the Jedi way, he didn't kill his father and barely knew him, and was the most feared in the Galaxy. Why Ben Kenobi couldn't finish him off or refused to try because Jedi only fight to defend not to kill. Rey is the powerful for no reason, how? Why? From the force awaken it was assumed she had some sort of background with the Force but nope, it's not like luke, Anakin, yodi and every Jedi didn't have to do years of training. Finn, Poe didn't progress as characters in my opinion. Lame marvel jokes. When the hell did fuel matter in a wartime situation. When you can hyper jump. The story didn't follow the original trilogy or force awaken. Lucas legacy was ruined, the Skywalker saga was tarnished and it obvious Disney wanted to end that. Poorly written and lazy written. Didn't follow the star wars philosophy and it was dumb.",-0.9875,263

The one who acts absolutely illogically, frees a bunch of horses instead of enslaved children, almost kills Finn in the process of saving him and is willing to let the entire rebellion get destroyed just so she can give him a kiss? Yeah, Overly Obsessed Girlfriend really was a fantastic character.",0.342,108

This movie is a straight up mess, plain and simple. There is no where to go at this point moving forward, all we have is boring Rey vs conflicted Kylo.",-0.9543,110
"It didn't do anything? How about Kylo's transformation to a complete Dark Sider is nearly complete. Leia acknowledged he is beyond saving and Kylo's ascension to Supreme Leader solidified that. How about Luke using the ultimate display of Force power by projecting himself across the galaxy, -- something so draining he ended up giving his life to save what was left of the Resistance. How about Rey growing from recluse who refused to leave Jakku to a bold heroine willing to go to the enemy to help her cause and growing in her acknowledgement that the Dark Side is tempting her? How about Leia showcasing her wisdom and the type of leadership she is by reminding Poe of the cost of small victories?",0.9561,131
"It does try to be different, and maybe that is where I disagree on the direction. The prequels weren't that great, but they still felt like star wars, written by the originator of the world.

It felt like a filler episode of a tv series rather than a second part of a trilogy. Terribly unsatisfying how they treated Luke. Rey is still a bland Mary sue and Daisy still can't act well. Finn served no purpose so was given a pointless sub plot that accomplished nothing other than give the character something to do. Characters introduced just to kill off ten minutes later in a lame attempt to make us feel emotion over their sacrific but without the writers actually having the balls to kill off any main characters we might care about. The awful shoe horned in humour which doesn't fit the movies at all. So many problems you seem to be blind to.,-0.9561,127

"Luke never made a map. Lor San Tekka simply found a map of an uncharted star system as he is an explorer when he was younger, leading to the same Jedi temple (the sacred tree) which also lead to Luke's hiding location. 

You seem to forget that Yoda and Obi Wan both did the same thing and were wiser than Luke ever will be. They had the order before them, Luke had none. Yoda giving him wisdom is again in Empire Strikes Back when Luke failed all of Yoda's test. Besides, Yoda does that to any Jedi, he's the wisest of them all. It's not only Luke. Rey is also destined to be much stronger in the force than Luke, and will be the better Jedi than him. Luke also told him that the force belongs to anyone, and isn't a power inside her when in the beginning she said: I don't know what to do with it. Luke also taught her about the downfall of the Jedi TWICE, and why it needs to end. Rey has this ambition inside her to want to bring the order back. Also, Luke will never have made Rey even more powerful had he not taught her to reach out to the force. Luke and Rey are on respectable boundaries, and you can even say for Yoda and Luke in ESB, they are ALLOWED to disagree with each other. 

His fall was not sudden. He failed the order AND his friend and sister's son, and he knew that Han and Leia will have to live with the fact that their only son turned to the dark side and is as evil as Vader. He has to live with the fact that Han and Leia had to suffer for it. Him disappearing isn't during the rise of the First Order, so he decided to take himself into hiding. 

""At least have him get off that dumb planet."" This literally has nothing to do with the CHARACTER. Why would him leaving the planet make any difference, especially if he can project himself halfway across the entire galaxy? It isn't the intention for him to leave the planet, and there shouldn't be any other reason for him to.

"Okay,  “let the past die, bury it if you have to” is Kylo Ren's motive, and Rian used Yoda to literally oppose that with ""failure is the greatest teacher"" teaching Luke about it. He's making a double point that letting the past die isn't the right way. 

""Luke is deconstructed"" why is that such a problem if Luke went through so much? It's just a layer to his character, he's always been a failure. He didn't save Vader from redemption, Vader did himself when the Emperor is frying Luke. 

Leia is the same character. She's just more powerful. That makes zero difference with her character before and after. You think for 30 years Leia doesn't develop any force powers. Leia is also more powerful in the force than Luke, but chose to pursue protecting the galaxy as a general. 

""This story shouldn’t go on forever. The story was the fall of this golden child deemed to be the chosen one, finally redeemed by his son’s fervent hope in him."" That is why he's a side character, they're giving him closure. ???

Luke's appearance on Crait is symbolic to the galaxy. He said he is not a legend when everyone think he is and claims he is flawed. His illusion acts of appearing before the entire First Order, buying time for Resistance and HIS SISTER to escape, and the whole galaxy believed that Luke, the one and all powerful, stood against the biggest evil in the galaxy. Luke inspired the entire galaxy with hope as shown with the stable children in Canto Bight, which paves way for a potential and hopeful rebellion in Episode 9. 

Kylo Ren can never be saved. He killed his father and tried to murder his mother, killed Snoke and took over as Supreme leader of the galaxy. Kylo Ren also tried to murder Luke again. ""“See You around, kid” What the fuck did you expect him to be? That's literally Luke if he's not ""deconstructed"" and now with that side of Luke you all wanted that is bad ass, you call him out for being off. 

""This story line shouldn’t have tied in to the first 6 movies, because now, there was no fall of the empire, we never see the fruits of the original trilogy, there was no return of the Jedi, and now original characters are used to shield viewers from seeing how bad these movies are. C3PO gets one line. R2D2 inactive for whole movie except to project some shit and power back down (again), Chewbacca is background comic relief. Ackbar died off camera, should’ve replaced Holdo in the movie. Nien Nunb is only in background shots. No reason for them to even be there man...""

That's literally your expectations subverting your enjoyment from the film. Nien Nunb has never been a written character, he literally sat next to Lando in Endor battle and offered nothing. Ackbar was a MEME, he had no character unlike Holdo, who had clear purpose. Also, it's war. That's how things go, war heroes will die out of unusual circumstances. Also, I love the closure giving to Han, Luke and Leia. It feels amazing to see them on screen again, and that's the point of the new trilogy. Whether you like it or not, there is finally closure. Also these movies aren't bad. TFA has largely positive reviews and positive buzz, The Last Jedi was divisive but still financially successful and enjoyed by many. The Star Wars franchise will continue and is in better hands than really any other studio that can helm it.",0.9665,695

"So..... Rey became a Jedi Knight in this movie. cool.. I suppose she did the training right???... well she didn't, luke trained her for one day barely...taught her  3 things.....  that in no way help her be a Jedi knight..

but she is still a Jedi knight...   when it is shown to be Jedi knight...  u need to be trained from birth... then u need to pass the jedi trials ok so... luke had less training too but. 

he was shown to be weak and not a Jedi when he first fought as sith and got his ass handed to him and it eas established he is not a Jedi he didn't become a Jedi until episode 6  and had at least 3x the training of rey.  so don't come at me with that but luke didn't  did this to bs...  it is completely different.

Now next in the new Jedi knight rays journey... let's just look at some previous deeds.. what has she done in terms of lets say the ""Jedi trials"" of becoming a  Jedi knight from an apprentice..   she has  flow a  ship,,  fixed things,   defeated a  wounded unbalanced force  user in a fight and killed some fancy red guards.  what did obi wan do to become a jedi knight?

Oh, he did nothing compared to rey..he jus defeated a full-fledged sith warrior who was trained since he was a  child..  for years and years by one of the most powerful dark side users in the history of the force...    did obi wan kenobi  earnb his jedi knight status yes..  did  rey earn   hears HELL NO... she  is still   in actual star wars lore terms WHICH THEY COMPLETLEY     got a match and lit it on fire in this movie and burned it all to the ground erasing  40 years of star wars lore  and history.. not even  worthy of the apprentice  rank...   is now a jedi knight... okay... disney... okay....   NO.

So what is next in the adventures of the fastest forcer user in the history to progress through the ranks of the jedi.....

Well...   an 800-year-old master...  who is supposed to be wise...   got turned into a dumb hack in this movie. and said..REY doesn't need to learn anything.. she already automatically knows it all... because the force told her.... to quote han solo... that is not how the force works..  yoda.... wtf man????? you have been disnyified...

OKay so between that in a span of minutes...   REY  now progressed to the rank of jedi master...  after she is considered lukes apprentice when she did nothing to earn that she did not to earn a jedi knight rank.  she is somehow now a MASTER.. and is going rebuild the jedi order????  give me a goddam break Kathleen Kennedy.. stop pushing your goddam fucking agenda.. this is so stupid so ridiculous so unbelievable it is a goddam joke.

What is she going to teach them... to lift rocks and force push.. great you do that rey.. and they will all be jedi masters within 2 days..with all that knowledge.

Everything i stated is true and actually happens in the movie...  it is so disrespectful  to the  past characters to the fans to all the movies to all the lore that is still cannon it is a  slap in the face to the fans.. the REAL fans.. it is  a disgrace to star wars  and disgrace to me....and  an absolutely  feminism driven character  being pushed by the agenda of Kathleen Kennedy.

Star Wars is dead....  sure ill go see the next film cause why not but after that im done. I will never ever watch another saga film again...EVER.. i will only watch standalone films..which are not being controlled by the corporates at Disney and by the  SJW agenda Kathleen Kennedy.

"TLJ had some amazing moments and some cringeworthy moments, but the majority of the movie had a serious case of the mehs. I am no longer excited for Rian Johnson's trilogy, since I found his directing/editing skills to be lackluster. Also, TLJ did not get me on board with the sequel trilogy. TFA didn't give me enough to be on board with the sequel trilogy, but it could've been salvaged if TLJ was great, but I was seriously underwhelmed by TLJ. Aside from some amazing visuals, it was a poorly made/constructed film (meandering and often pointless because many scenes didn't contribute to the larger narrative), even if you take Star Wars out of the equation. People keep calling this film bold, but I didn't really find much to be bold at all. TLJ also did nothing to address the Mary Sue accusations from TFA. If anything, it made it worse.",0.6652,173
"That's not my argument. I'm saying that the change was poorly driven and executed. Of course Luke won't be the same. It'd be the other extreme if he was the same. That's not my argument. There's so much we don't see. We don't see Luke's reaction to Han's death, yet we see him being playfully pessimistic with Rey moments later. We don't really see Luke as a teacher, either. There was too much left to flesh out with this new aspect of the character, and his death meant the end of that, which is so dumb. Felt rushed to me and didn't jive with the previous story. A hero can have a fall from grace, but follow one of the basic rules of storytelling and show, don't tell. Show some of the peaceful period in the galaxy, show the relationship he had with Ben before the ""incident"". Show Leia using the Force in a different way than being a God-like entity that can survive space. For me, and I say again FOR ME, the payoff was there without adequate setup. The setup that was there seemed to be a cheap fan-fiction that was written by someone who didn't really know who Luke was. Mark Hamill was right on this one, imo",0.2825,238

"There is no changes in characters though. Han and Leia were literally the same character as they were before but more experienced, and I love them. Chewie, R2 and C3P0 are the same (yeah of course), For the case of Luke only, it's not change but evolution in his character. It's not the kind of evolution we wanted for sure, because he became pessimistic, but at the same time he became much more experienced and powerful. There is also an interesting arc with his character in TLJ that I think is a reflection of him in the originals. If you really want me to explain, then it'll take forever, but point is, Luke's character hasn't changed because he's always been flawed even in the originals. TLJ is another redemption arc for his character. Besides, it's not his story anymore. He's just an amazing side character in this new trilogy, and I'm more pleased they are willing to end his arc in a beautiful way. If Luke isn't flawed, there will be nothing to make him on Crait equally as symbolic and powerful as it is for the people and the state of the galaxy. 

TLJ hit no reset button on the franchise. The franchise will never stop growing.  Rian's intention was to look forward, not look back.

"This movie should anger and piss you off to no Extent if you were a Real/loyal Star Wars fan which clearly you are not.

The new characters get no Development what so ever in this new movie they are just there in the movie.

Rey is still a Mary Sue she got 2 out of the so called Lesson's and they did nothing because it was just Luke lecturing her and there was no real training of any kind, So don't know what the hell you are smoking about her not been a Mary Sue. She is still Mary Sue and for no god damn reason other than hey I'm a girl and the movie acknowledges that very fact by taking jabs at Kylo Ren for it.

The Fact most people are coming to realise this is good because it means the next movies won't do so well anymore, because no body wants to see this Trash.

There is no continuation after Return of the Jedi, these movies can just fuck off and live by themselfs, Real loyal fans of Star Wars should disregard these movies period.

Also this is not something even Dave Filoni could ever fix or work around because the movies are the movies and the movie acknowledges the Mary Sue fact numerous times.

Male characters are morons or made to look like ones or they straight up stupid.

You don't like Clone Wars and Ashoka never grew on you but you liked what they did with her in Rebels when she was barely used or appeared, you sir are a fucking idiot to the highest degree.

I love Both Clone Wars and Rebels they both have great characters that are relatable or at the very least likeable.

Akbar just dies and the lightsaber fight is so lack luster. Snoke is shown as soooo strong and then dies lol. Rose is so bad. Casino world and all the Finn stuff was irrelevant as fuck.

Your defense seems to revolve around it being fiction so anything goes. Never mind quality, the laws set within it's own universe and internal logic of the story, established character traits, writing characters well with a point to their being in the story etc. Just that it's Star Wars so it can do as it likes and you'll lap it up.

"Yes, Rogue One was far superior to last Jedi, I rank LJ near the bottom of Star Wars films.",0.3818,22
"Yes, but they didn't set this up AT ALL. It doesn't mesh. This Luke Skywalker that we've known for 30 years is now so drastically different, and his fall was from the exact same type of thing we saw him overcome in Episode 6. I'm sorry, but I strongly disagree. This movie negates the happy ending of a 35 year old movie. You need to set it up better for fans to accept it. 

""You don't know shit about Star Wars"" is the lamest argument ever. Read a book, like a book from the Thrawn Trilogy, because then you'll see what a good future to the original trilogy looks like. Really, anything by Timothy Zahn is awesome. He created my two favorite expanded universe characters, Thrawn and Mara Jade.",0.9847,148

Luke being an absolute fluke. Snoke is a total WASTE. Finn was a total waste of time with his tupid subplot.The humour in this movie is trash. Its up there with Jar Jar I could go on, but am not gonna go on some rant here:) 

All movies is subjective & I always respect your opinion ALOT, but we have total different opinions here, but that is always great in the movie world xD Love your content & videos as always man:)",0.8992,130

i've never really been a star wars fan... the first trilogy i dug.. the prequels just 'meh'..EXCEPT for Qui Gon-Jin and that fight with Darth Maul...CLASSIC.
But, now..starting with The Force Awakens...i'm gettin' it..and even getting really INTO the whole buzz...
now, The Last Jedi...i just saw it...
I  L O V E  I T .....!!!!! sure there are some jarring attempt-at-comedy moments and the middle part's kinda drags...but overall...compared to TFA, TLJ really gives me those fist-pump moments... i mean... oh shit...this is not the spoiler review, huh... a'ight...",-0.9526,167
