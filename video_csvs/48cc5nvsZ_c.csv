Also you can't help but be aware this is watching the trash be taken out just with more spectacle and it creates all kinds of questions like why so carelessly drop this thing where there are people living nearby and it could have killed them?

"first glance i thought....oh fuck off, not another cheap knock off scene just copied from the originals.

then i see the hole...
and i realized they was pulling along a destroyed star destroyer with tractor beams, so i was like ok cool, a suttle nod to the original and then quickly flip it to a completely differently scenario.
the crashing of the star destroyer into the planet was/would have been amazing, then i realized its jakku... so i lost interest haha, them dropping it onto a first order/ imperial base would of been way cooler, its a kind of gorilla warfare tactic, seeing the rebels do that would of been cool.

  in the beginning of force awakens, making the rebels seem in full control and the first order was just the insignificant remnants of the empire that the rebels were stamping out...then star killer base happens...
(snoke could of been hiding it with the force or something, like how kamino was hidden in the clone wars, building up an army). it blows up the new republic planets and its fleets, so the rebels main force is gone and so then its the rebels, once again, who are the minority of control and power. then the film carries on as it normal from there.

 that can make so much more sense to tie into the last Jedi, how fucked that film is, where it is just like 20 rebel survivors and the main huge villain we know nothing about dies half way through the trilogy!. good luck on the 3rd film making any plausible sense lmfao. there is no meaningful sense into how after the original films beat the empire, the rebels are still struggling, straight of the bat in the new trilogy. at least make them look like they brang peace to the galaxy and was in control in the beginning of force awakens, just make it go down hill for the new republic and the rebels after star killer base destroys the republic planets.

just have ^this^ opening scene showing the rebels controlling, hammering and stamping out all the remnants of the empire, then boom the mysterious star killer base sneak attacks and  blows up the new republic the bulk of the rebels fleet, etc... causing total shock and being caught off guard, putting all the surviving rebels into confusion and whatever...

but obliterating their huge fleet forces the main remaining rebels to attack and blow up star killer base (so the first order isnt suddenly, extremely, unrealistically more powerful for the films sake)
end of force awakens...

...start of the last jedi...(the more logical plot that leads the force awakens into the last Jedi making most of the bullshit you see in it somewhat more believable and logical) but after star killer base is destroyed the first order is still left powerful enough to be the new dominating force in the galaxy and forces the remaining main rebels to flee their main base to try regroup with other rebel allied forces scattered in the galaxy and outer rim....anyway ive typed too much,
 im actually real passionate about making the star wars story make sense, it is COMPLETELY FUCKED AT THE MOMENT, THANKS TO RIAN JOHNSONS SELFISH NEED TO THROW OUT THE PLANNED PLOT LINE and i cant stand its been screwed over, and it pisses me off that directors or whoever make the films without looking deep into the existing story and lore and making a film work and make sense, especially with such a prominent franchise like star wars, where they know the fans are expecting certain key things and stuff to happen, completly ignoring fans theories and expectaions, they need to  take that into concideration and be way more cautious with attention to detail and making things make sense and continue the story WITHOUT SWITCHING THE DIRECTION AND STORY IN A COMPLETE DIFFERENT DIRECTION, BLATANTLY THROWING OUT HUGE MAIN KEY PLOTS HALF WAY THROUGH A TRILOGY. oke bye lol my mind is in thought so deep i feel like im literally in starwars.",-0.9912,748
