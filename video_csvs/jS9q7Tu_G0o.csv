"I know I'm late watching this, but I noticed you keep saying, ""Why does it look better on him."" I'm no beauty critic or anything, I'm just a random girl. But I think that it looks better on JeffreeStar, no offense, because of his face structure. Like I said, I'm no beauty critic, it's just what I think. But overall, I love you. You make some of the best and funny videos. And I wish you an amazing time. Love you : )",0.9919,100

tbh i'd love to see you recreate another dramatic makeup look but with a fun and colorful wig and maybe take some pics or spend the day doing some errands all dressed up just so you could get a taste of what a lot of beauty gurus with more extreme appearances feels like ?? your usual look is pretty toned down compared to JS so it was exciting to see something different on you! ^ . ^,0.9802,79
