I love how some people JUST realized they’ve been doing this. It’s to also make people buy their new “ORIGINAL” phones. Like the 8 I mean 7 with wireless charging and the iPhone X with a crappy full screen and annoying notch and no Touch ID and a turned camera that’s a feature apparently. Samsung galaxy S8 or Note 8 did the new phone perfectly. The full screen looks great it has instant Face ID instead of scanning the face and then swiping up like the X and it has Touch ID on the back while the iPhone X doesn’t due to the timeframe and Apple wanting to get the phone out as quickly as possible. I have a iPhone 7 rn and lemme tell you the next phone I get will be a new galaxy and face apple lovers.... Samsung and android are surpassing Apple at the pass of each day and will soon surpass them entirely if Apple keeps getting lazy with their phones like the 8 and X.,0.875,188
