"All companies need to rethink their production processes and try to add recycled raw materials to their products. More fences, fishing piers and docks, and home decks should be made of recycled plastic materials rather than wood.
More products can be made using recycled materials as their raw materials. It only takes a company wanting to make the change. Recycled content should be in more products we buy.",0.0,75
China is upset with our recyclables? Ha! What a joke!,0.3786,13
"Excellent point.  We have new neighbors from Louisiana.  Actually6 months and EVERY DAY they r a little more trashy.  No problem until they moved in.  Garbage on property including beer cans and NO ONE ELSE even drinks alcohol. So...
Of COURSE we ALL welcomed them on move in and except for them (& we didn't know people could be so shitty!), EVERYONE goes out of way for each other.  1st week I explained the trash AND recycling rules and city HERE DOES NOT mess around.  Explained THAT too of COURSE.
They ARE jerks, in typical jerk manner HAD to put garbage stinky garbage and diapers etc in recycling bins.  I re-explained it, and I am ONLY4 ten AND I had to go get all nasty to move THEIR garbage from recycle bins to garbage.  Told dude NOT happening again.  On your own.  He immediately did it again AND everyone nice is having to move because Mr n Mrs White Trash Smith continue getting progressively worse.  I'm STILL not shitty to them NOT stooping to the gutter but you betcha they definitely running us off.  ALL of US. 
We had ZERO problems and zero pests.  Now its parking problems, garbage AND THEIR trash every where and recycle bins stink to high HEAVEN with these people's trash!  
They have GOT to be miserable AND I am going to be LMAO the MINUTE someone else moves in.  
Kinda hoping that THEY leave....  Its a NICE neighborhood.  Gr8 people EXCEPT for them.  Its a couple with a baby bringing up a child to be lousy excuses for people like they are?  WHY have a child when you are MISERABLE?  A BABY IS A BLESSING ON A LOVING RELATIONSHIP.  ABSOLUTELY NOT TO BE USED TO HANG ON TO SOMEONE OR SAVE A FAILING MARRIAGE!  
I AM SAD FOR ALL THREE OF THEM.  
I DON'T PROJECT MY CACA ONTO OTHER PEOPLE.  WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS?  I HAVE NOTICED THAT THEY APPEAR TO GET A KICK OUT OF SCREWING WITH THE GOOD NEIGHBORS.  IT WILL WEAR OFF SOON ENOUGH.  
They're VERY lucky we are NOT retaliatory people!  THIS is MY venting so I DO appreciate the outlet.  
No good deed goes unpunished eyes? Smh.... (I JUST had an evil little thought of what if someone put a return to sender sticker on their lmao k. G'night y'all)",0.9791,438
"Guess I wasn't clear enough. At present, recycling is mostly a ""make yourself feel good"" endeavor which really only helps minimally. We need a complete redesign of our lives, manufacturing, marketing, and shopping to drive society towards reducing waste with goal of zero waste. And until we reach zero waste, we need to really focus on reducing consumption by reusing and repurposing. We need to design all manufacturing so that the ""smoke stack"" and any effluent pipe, etc all empty right into the board room of that company.",-0.6711,103
"I have to add that the trash company gives you a recycling container twice the size of the trash container and there is no separation of recycled items.  If the trash company said put your paper in here and plastics in here and glass in here, most people would do it that is called presort, it would lower the cost of facility sorting to some degree. Charge more to households that do not clean their containers.  Also if companies would just stop using all these plastic containers for everything under the sun, that would also help immensely.",-0.6319,104
"I knew there was too much recycling... But China benefited by the manufacturing of it. And they are very careful and responsible to their environment in manufacturing.... S the least we could do is send their products back to them in better condition... Also, with our apologies for being white, men in particular. blahaha",0.7474,61
"I once threw a deer skin, guts and head in the organic waste disposal: does that make me a bad person? I mean, it's organic, isn't it? Oh, and how about a dozen oyster shells? Dirty flu-contaminated tissues in the paper recycle? What is recyclable, and what isn't? Who knows ... I have no idea ...",-0.9074,67
"In the uk at least in my part of the country, we have garden related recycling bin, a food recycling bin and plastic/glass/paper( in one recycling bin) and a general waste bin. So 4 in total. There are places where you can go and sort each material out individually but not in the comfort of your own home.",-0.5522,69

Recycling in the us is stupid why would you put everything in one recycle bin? How about putting paper in a bin for paper plastic in one for plastic and organic stuff in a bin for organic stuff. Now the recycling-plant only has to worry about how good the quality is.,-0.5267,54
"SWANA really appreciates this video, and is playing a leadership role in educating local/state governments, industry recyclers, and citizens (that's you and me, folks) about the critical role we all play in making sure that we recycle right.  learn more at swana.org",0.7778,51

"Yeah I completely agree that the current insufficient state of recycling infrastructure is not really providing a satisfactory solution and that too many people are just not aware of this. A workable solution has to begin with designing products with easy reuse/repair/recycling in mind. I don’t know how your comment was not clear, but thanks anyway for the elaboration. As a start this video should get more views…",0.1658,79

make landfills an industry like prisons... municipalities will pay for you to take their garbage and that money will be coming from garbage taxes... landfill owners on the other hand can win more by recycling the stuff further on,0.8442,41
