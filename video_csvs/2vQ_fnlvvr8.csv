"+BettinaBalser One of my college roomates gave me this cassette after he got the CD. I have been a fan ever since. They played a free show on the 4th of July in Kettering, Ohio years ago that got rained out. It was my one time to see them (they never came anywhere near here after that) and even though the weather ruined the show it is still a pleasant memory that I recall everytime I hear them.",0.802,86

"@DestroyerofSouls666 This catchy, creative, melodic music will never be produced again...or at least we won't hear it in the mainstream.  WHY oh why do record companies keep looking for artists that all sound EXACTLY the same?    ",0.4404,42

"Heard this by chance on the radio in 1990 and invested in the 12"" single. All 3 tracks (also 'Room Without A View' and 'Maria Elena') are fab. The album's pretty good too ! P.S. A friend pointed out the similarity to 'In My Life' by The Beatles in the instrumental break...but hey, nothing wrong with being a Beatle fan !",0.9568,78
Holy crap I never knew there was a video for this song!  Dinizio's gruff baritone vs. Belinda's grace... great combo for a rock duet.  Dang what great memories.,0.784,33

"I bought 11 in January 1990, on cassette.  It is February 2015, and while the cassette is long gone, I am still listening to this album in its entirety at least once or twice a week.  Smithereens records are like fine wine...they get better with age :-)  DiNizio is a splendid songwriter.",0.9062,60
"I bought this CD when it came out.  I love this song.  But I had never seen the video until now.  I moved from NJ to Los Angeles in 1999 and got to know a band called Darling Violetta.  Their cellist was Gerry Sutyak, who plays on this.  I had no idea she was featured so prominently in this video.  Very cool.  Thanks.",0.927,72

"I don't know anything of art, paints and Picasso's. But, I love ALL around this fucking song, The Smithereens, The Beatles, Belinda Carlisle, the NYC of Ramones, and other things that remind me to ""Mr Tambourine Man'"" of The Byrds, to those drunk nights in the CBGB and old songs from Morrissey. Really Magic. A JEWEL OF SONG",0.7439,72

"I'm generally not a fan of country music and I usually cringe when I hear rock artists having their music covered by country performers,  but I think this song would work really well as a country arrangement.
