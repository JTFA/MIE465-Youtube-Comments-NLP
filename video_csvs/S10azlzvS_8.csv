"For those who don't know or are new to Mamamoo:

1. Mamamoo will comeback with their 6th mini album 'Yellow Flower' on the 7th of March at 6pm KST
2. The title track 'Starry Night' is an electro house song (a new genre they wanna challenge). 
3. You can support their comeback by buying the physical album, streaming their music on Korean sites or on YouTube, buying their songs on iTunes or voting for them during music shows. 

2018 is going to be a very busy year for Mamamoo, they will release 4 mini albums. One mini album for each member, each season and each member is designated a colour (see their Paint Me Mv https://youtu.be/S10azlzvS_8 ). They will do different music genres in each album and highlight one member. For instance; 

1. Spring (Yellow)  = Hwasa (Yellow Flower). 

The order in which they will release the other albums or the names of the albums are not confirmed yet but Moomoos speculate that it will be in this order. 

2. Summer (Red) = Moonbyul ( Red Star?) 
3. Autumn (White) = Wheein (White Breeze?) 
4. Winter ( Blue) = Solar (Blue Sun?)

This is a fresh and innovative idea, please support Mamamoo. 😊",0.9468,249
