"I am so glad Bobi got his forever home he deserved!  My husband and I had a Bobby too.  In April of 2007, we sadly had to say good bye to him as he Cushings Disease.  We only had him  nine months before .  Our Bobby was nine years old and the last nine years of his life were the happiest.  He was such a sweet dog, never stopped smiling!  The day before we said good bye to him, I had a full hysterectomy, and my dear Dad passed away on the 15th of March. Then at the end of the year on September 30th, we said goodbye to my Mom as she too passed away.  The following January my girlfriend moved in temporary and my husband told me the day she moved in that he lost his job he had for years... Good night and God bless you all.",0.9655,164
