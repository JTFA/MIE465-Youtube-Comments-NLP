Christina Maria Aguilera. Whitney Houston literally told you TO YOUR FACE that you did the best cover of Run to you she's ever heard. I needed more from this performance. The moment should've been so much more.  I would love to do the stan thing and say it was so amazing but you're capable of so much more than this.,0.8431,65

"God is Good.  And because God is Good He makes Heaven.  And because God makes Heaven He takes ALL to Heaven because God is good.  And Heaven is the Cure.  And because God is Good He wants to cure ALL.  And because God is God He will cure ALL.  Therefore ALL go to Heaven.  Because who wants to keep anybody sick lingering in a sickness treated with an ongoing treatment?  Since God is Good He does not want to keep anybody sick.  So God will cure ALL by taking ALL to Heaven.  Heaven is not the ongoing treatment.  God must take ALL to Heaven otherwise he is not good, And therefore not God.  And so this God is a better God than Jesus.  Some might say that then they won't have Jesus to guide them.  But they have each other and their parents and the government to guide them.  So God is Good ALL go to Heaven.

"It wasn't technically perfect, nor it was meant to be that. The point was to deliver an emotional performance, and I think Xtina nailed it. In the most recognizable parts of those songs her vocal performance reminded me of Whitney. In other parts she gave herself more freedom to stay true to her own style of singing. That gives an impression of a bit inconsistent performance. But knowing Xtina's vocal brilliance, I have no doubt it was all deliberate decision.",0.7903,89
"Its not bad, in my first view, but the more I replay, I get into it and I think this is amazing. She sings her way, beautiful tone in with long dress. She just needs to put more high notes in chorus",0.9257,48
