"2 Real 4 Em Also, how is this song not a flop when it couldn’t even make it to the HOT 100? Even a Chris Brown collab can’t help her chart, tragic. Remy only has two entries while Nicki is the female with the most entries with 84",0.1867,56
"2 Real 4 Em Cause I like Chris Brown, and I don’t like Remy Ma as a person. It doesn’t mean I can’t like her music. I’m open minded and wanted to hear her new single. Nicki’s currently away bevause she’s finishing her album. Also, she’s still making the headlines while being away, for being away. It’s been 2 months and everyone misses her. Nobody missed Remy when she was away for 8 years for shooting her own friend over a money argument.",0.6249,109
