"Btw, to the people who say that this is awful and 30stm is just generic pop now let me tell you two things. We heard 2 tracks from the new album, none of us know what the actual full record is going to be like. If you end up not liking it, that's totally fine. You don't have to like the music that they're making. But people, bands, grow over time. I'd actually be quite shocked if they hadn't changed at all over the past years. While it might not be what all of us are used to and love, I'm more than happy to see that the three of them are pushing their boundaries and do the music they like and feel at the time. So how about we just wait for the full record and respect the decisions the band has made as it seems to be the path they choose and what fulfills them.",0.9328,171

"I think the most obvious conclusion and what everyone seems to forget, is that after touring for 15 years plus the nAtural affects of aging, it produces wear and tear on a singers voice that most of the time never recovers. So to think that someone would be able to hit the high notes and belting projections later in life is kinda stupid...naturally one would have to take a different approach to the music. You can’t keep doing arena rock songs when you can’t sing like that anymore. With that being said, I’m impressed with what he can still do vocally at his age",0.7351,118

"That just sounds like a fucked up love story: as it started with burning passion and desire. A love filled with emotions and passions. Then the lies began and the true communication between them disappeared. They hid behind drugs and alcohol till their conversations became hollow. 

You are beautiful as an angel but you have a heart of ghost (heartless?? IDK). It began as strangers to lovers (in danger? Danger from what? Society? Career? Too sentimental? No idea). 

'Dangerous night to fall in love' may be trying to say, this time is not really safe for our love? So they break up but the memories of this relation still haunts him. What if we tried harder or some shit. 

But he still hopes. 'Our love will cross the lines and expose us. So what? Why should we hide ourselves?' And stuff. But the time is running out and the hope is fading. This love is burning him inside out so come back before there is nothing left. Or something like that. 

I don't know. But I wouldn't want it to be my love story.... It won't let me move on but won't let me be together with my lover too. So..... I have no idea. It's just my thought. 

it's not the first time Jared Leto hinting about broken love stories. But this song isn't romantic to me. It sounds too unhappy.",0.9809,275
