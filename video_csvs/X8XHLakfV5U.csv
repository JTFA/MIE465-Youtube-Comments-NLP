"A valid question Carl. And as with any good question, all you have to do is follow the money.

Nearly every early pioneer in animation has fallen into the public domain, having been produced by now deceased companies & unable to be promoted on the commercial scale.....except of course for Disney. Every documentary, commercial, etc. produced by Disney has been to perpetuate the myth that Snow White was the 1st full length feature film, with no detractors or academics caring to set the record straight for decades. And once that image is in the heads of millions, its hard to get it right again.

Life lesson: Disney writes the history books.",0.6908,127

"Carl Makes Videos 
It really depends what you consider a feature film to be. A lot of early animated films were short simply because of technological limitations. But they had the story structure of feature films and were quite popular and influential. 

In short, it simply is better marketing, not just back then but Disney's marketing nowadays as well. Had Disney gone bankrupt postwar we'd probably barely remember Snow white.",0.2091,77
"Croc she was certainly almost completely devoted to fairytales, but she got her beginnings by making special effects for The Golem, credit sequences for Fritz Lang... she was also going to make an animated sequence for the Madame Bovary movie directed by Renoir -Renoir was a good friend of Carl Koch and when he was attacked in fascist italy and fled the country Koch was left to finish the movie Renoir started.
Id say that despite making quite conservative stories based on childrens stories Lotte Reiniger's movies had a lot of technique and artistry to them. Achmed is almost certainly her best movie, imo, because of the effects and how fresh and creative it must have been in its time",0.9752,128
"Croc yup. he was part of the same group of german avant garde artists reiniger and koch were into -from which there were also fischinger, wegener, weill and brecht, among others; pretty ironic, when ruttmann later went on to direct propaganda documentaries on nazi weaponry under riefenstahl",-0.0516,54

Early animated films had a huge impact on cinema, popeye and betty boop were icons well before snow white hit the screen, and those are just minor examples. Yes they were short films but they were treated like feature length films at the time and had full house showings all over the western world.

"SnowWhite‚Äôs claim to be the first feature animated film isn‚Äôt entirley untrue, but it isn‚Äôt entirely true either. It is considered the first animated feature film because it was the first animated film to be feature-length, that is to say, about an hour-and-a-half. It was also the longest animated film at that point, and is 17 minutes longer than Prince Achmed (which is 65 minutes) and ran at a full 24 frames per second, which is more than Prince Achmed (from what I‚Äôve seen it looks like it keeps between 6 and 12 frames per second). However, Snow White still is not technically exactly the first animated feature film because Prince Achmed meets the feature film length requirements of the time (and of the AMPAS). So I guess it just depends on what you would consider counts as a real feature film. Hope this is helpful :)",0.9635,172
