"Where do I sign up to make beatmaps for that?

Also, a few things I feel like I need to point out in the beatmap itself (from the full version of this):
- some movements felt a bit awkward, as in ""unnatural"", considering how the song was progressing and what the cubes' rhythm was following (referring to mostly the second half of the song tho)
- it feels a bit of a shame to not have some type of cube that forces you to ""hold"" it for a certain amount of time. It might be due to my experience with certain rhythm games, but it felt necessary in some parts. I also believe it can add variety in the long run: people will easily get used to certain patterns when they are just cubes, so adding something which you don't know exactly how long it will be until you play it sounds nice.",0.9194,172
Whoever made this trailer needs a raise. I have not been so hyped for a game in awhile.,0.0,20
Will this tune be available somewhere sometime outside the game? I LOVE IT,0.7125,14
Wonder how many people are going to throw their shoulder out playing this,0.2023,13
Would be even better if you could add the function to let players use their own music and have the game come up with the beats/obstacles/whateveryoucallem via algorithm. It's what keeps me coming back to Audioshield.,0.4404,42
