"Ok yes, this is definitely a weird time for this to come out especially with the recent surprise hit of All the Money in the World. However, i'm not going to lie throughout the duration of that film as much as I did enjoy it I kept thinking how much better it'd be if it was a TV show and now that it's going to be I'm honestly really excited to see what differences we will get here. There is a lot more to dive into especially in regards to who Getty was as a person and I don't know if Sutherland can top how dynamic Plummer was in his role but I definitely am excited to see this take on the story. Hillary Swank and Brendan Fraser both look perfectly casted and there's definitely tons of potential for this show overall especially considering it's on FX who almost always succeed aside from a few pitfalls (I'm looking at you Snowfall).",0.986,169
