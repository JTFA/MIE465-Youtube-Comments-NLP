"Greetings from Brazil!

I am astonished by how well, entertaining and informative your videos are! They are excellent and I really do hope that you don’t stop making them. 

I have absolutely no idea how you improvise like that. After many failed trials, I personally can’t do more than hit some basic triads while playing around one scale, which gets frustrating very quickly as I have no idea how to develop anything interesting, harmonically speaking (even with some understanding of harmony). You have fantastic abilities!

Have a lovely day!",0.9737,106
HAHAHA I was just shouting LOW BASS NOTE! during the Philip Glass,0.4199,13
"Hah. The Phillip glass one had me laughing. The Chopin version was beautiful.

I know he doesn't exactly count as a classical composer but if you ever do another one of these can I request Gershwin please?",0.7579,41

I love your annotations!!!  So helpful.,0.8469,10
I loved your Rach imitation. Spot on,0.5994,8
"I loved the piano-side of your cool idea. What you could work more on is the comments you have the composers themselves making. Perhaps have Mozart saying ""Really?! That's what you think I'd sound like?"" Debussy going ""Get off it, you fruitcake!"" Philip Glass ""Like hell ya do!..."" etc But again, very interesting and amusing idea - thanks for sharing this!",0.945,78

If an untrained person, (or even a trained person) can grasp even one of these 'style bullet points', they've opened a door through which they can engage with the composer!
Thank you!",0.8065,49
"I've mostly listened to Chopin's Nocturnes and have been wanting to expand my horizons.

"Well, I haven't checked-out your channel full channel content yet and you may have already done something along these lines but if you haven't already and find yourself short on ideas (doubtful) one fine day, there are two things I would love to see your take on. One would be how those baroque dudes shifted western music's focus towards harmony by lining up those voices into harmonic coherence ( as opposed to Renaissance music) and the other one would be on rhythm and it's centrality in music as, from my perspective (a self-taught rank beginner, at 55) rhythm seems to be the neglected child of Music Youtubers which I find somewhat paradoxical since it is obvious to even a guy like myself that missing an odd note or even a chord change won't screw up the communal experience any way near what unintentionally messing with the pulse will do...That's it...No need to respond or fear that I will deluge you with suggestions.
