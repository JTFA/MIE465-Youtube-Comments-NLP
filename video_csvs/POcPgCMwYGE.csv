"A Whale i thought the Patriots were going to lose. Like I said before 16 players were on IR, 6+ crucial starters were out. Playing in Miami is only one of 4 locations Brady has a losing record. Bradys achilles injury kept him from practicing the last two weeks. It all added up to the Patriots losing. They're still the best team in the game and will prove that at Heinz field and crush the Steelers as usual. Good for the dolphins, that's they're only accomplishment in 50+ years, Theyve managed to beat the Patriots at home 7-9 times since the Brady/Bill era started.",0.0258,118

"Anthony Arellano Miami has proven that they can't win anything meaningful with or without a healthy cast. The Patriots when mostly healthy do win meaningful games so citing injuries makes sense. Take 2015, they were 10-0 and then wam almost half the team gets injured costing them home field advantage and the AFC champ game. Same things happening this season, injuries are the Patriots only weakness. If they can get healthy they're going to another Superbowl.",-0.9354,83
"Anthony Arellano that's one way of looking at it. Teams not capitalizing on opportunities is a part of sports. The score reads 20-27 and the Patriots had plenty if opportunities to tie the game up but didnt. Using the refs as an excuse is pretty lame. Every team can do that for every loss and blame theyre misfortunes on the refs. The Patriots had 16 players on IR and were missing 6+ crucial starters, Brady himself was playing injured and had limited practice most of the last 3 weeks. The dolphins played they're Superbowl, good for them.",-0.6941,107

"Cold Winter The Patriots most definitely got stomped. Their offense was shut down for the entirety of the game. That last touchdown to narrow the score was practically in garbage time. Looks like someone didn't watch the game.

Also, it was the the Dolphins who beat the Patriots. Nobody thought they would win which makes it even more embarrassing for the Patriots.",0.6597,69
"Cold Winter so now we are going to cite injuries for losses? Lets look at miami last year, 9 starters out on IR back up qb behind a back up with a back up lbs and a back up secondary into the season finale and playoffs....did we cry about it no its called next man up...the team we beat was the team that beat buffalo and was on an 8 game winstreak hence why they were favored going in...and still had good players active that game...you got out played, and miami was more the physical team...the excuses do nothing for you",0.4215,114
Cold Winter you mean trying to find excuses to justify being man handled?
