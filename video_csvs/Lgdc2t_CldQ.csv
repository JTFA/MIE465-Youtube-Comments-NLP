"The depiction of violence, in any form is deplorable.  This is the stuff of the hell realms.  Any depiction of violence to the mind is absorbed in the mind and causes the soul to attempt to feed upon violence.  The world you live is in formed by what you put into your mind.  Fill you mind with violence, and find you are living in a violent world.  If you don't want to live in a world where there is violence, then why are you filling you mind with violence?  Football is a primitive activity and the open secret is that the concussions produced by players are a huge issue.
