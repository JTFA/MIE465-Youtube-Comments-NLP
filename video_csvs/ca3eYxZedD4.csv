Back in the early 2000s ... I had coasters that were always at the top of no limits 1 websites.  I would spend weeks in 3dsmax making models and themeing everything.  I thought I was good!  This makes what I used to do look like I was using MSPAINT!  This is insane....completely insane.  It actually had a pace that was so well done that I felt true suspense like watching a movie.  Just EPIC!   This should go down in coaster games history as one of the best ever created.  You sir....need to be hired by disney to be an imagineer!,0.9494,113

"Jaw-dropping! 

How is it possible for me, a middle-aged man (and well-worn coaster & theme park enthusiast) to actually feel the tingling anxiousness of the mounting dread, producing genuine fear.  This full sensory ride is a marvel of an extreme rush of adrenaline multiple times over! The ebb and flow of continuous suspense and terror, building up  to a ‚Äúdown-to-the-wire‚Äù climax of true exhilaration is something I never would have thought possible from a DIY amusement attraction construction CGI product. With the white-knuckler excursion clocking in at almost twelve minutes, the majority of the ultimate dark-thrill ride rarely flags (brief sections fall victim of repetition, being just a wisp of criticism, the slight D√©j√† vu factor, a natural by-product from any thrill attraction of this length). But the pulse pounding excitement never runs aground and a rousing race in the home stretch provides visceral, euphoric relief from the jettisoned escape.  With freedom victorious and to finally exhale while approaching the home ship in space, the feeling morphs into almost serene sense calm (which becomes a less-than-ambiguous ‚Äúwink‚Äù at the very end).  

Bravo, absolute BRAVO!  

The amazing creativity along with your epic amount of time and irrefutable talent is clearly on display.  Never give up or let go of your drive and passion, as surely your gifted imagination will be a benefit and reward for the future thrill-seeking public.",0.9934,259

"Pretty neat.  Looks like it's not strictly Aliens, though, if I'm not mistaken.  Mother and the countdown to ship self destruct are from Alien, and I saw at least one clip from Alien: Isolation.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the reactor core was also Sevastapol station, was it not?

On the physics side of things, since people wish this were real, you've got a lot of high acceleration on flat straight-aways, rather than from drops, which would be REALLY intensive on the equipment.  Not to mention the accelerating climb at the beginning being....well, i can't see it as feasible.
And while an Alien fan can appreciate the long interludes of scenery and anticipation building, no themepark is going to go for it.  The scenery will be 5 seconds before they hit you with the excitement again.

Still, props on this!  Obviously took a TON of work, sweat, and love.",0.9711,177
