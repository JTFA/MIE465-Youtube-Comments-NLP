"I just watched Kraft's ""family"" ad. The notion that an ad on a family show such as the Super Bowl should promote deviant familial relationships is nauseating. Kraft should be condemned for promoting relationships that the Judeo-Christian ethic defines as abominable.
The same is true of T-Mobile's advertisement (the one with the babies, which states that it does not matter who you love).. The purpose of these ads is to get our children to falsely believe that all kinds of relationships are equal. But they are not equal! There is a right and a wrong; by confusing the two, Kraft and T-Mobile are undermining the moral fiber of our society.
So WHILE THE NFL TURNS DOWN AN INNOCUOUS AD in support of standing for the national anthem, it has no problem approving ads that destroy morality! Avi Goldstein",-0.607,154
