A good way to fix dice is to put the side you want it to land on facing up and put it in an oven for a couple minutes and the insides will melt to the bottom so when you throw it after wards it lands on the lightest side up which is the number you chose.(only works with plastic and other meltable materials),0.5423,68

"I'll give you this your idea is creative but the incorrect technique.  Boring out the holes on the faces is the proper method and there is certain way to go about this. They are then filled with lead or tungsten.  But!
Loaded die are not just loaded they are also shaved and rounded. Plus there is a die called a Tapit that is the ultimate version. 
Loaded die should never roll a single number every time if they did people would catch on to them instantly. 
The idea is to up your percentage of winning after all dice games are a percentage game and if you gain a 10% edge you win more with less chance of being noticed. Call it luck!?

Make sure when you split die you cut parallel to the length of the  wood grain instead of perpendicular. Should be less compression of the fibers-wood will have greater tendency to simply split instead of compressing.  Now i am wondering if I can take stacked MDF/hardboard to make a die. Once sanded the lines should be nearly invisible and you make loaded die from inside out instead of splitting one that already had been made..,-0.875,81
