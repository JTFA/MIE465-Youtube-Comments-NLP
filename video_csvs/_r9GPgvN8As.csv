I can't believe you've got FOOLED by the title of the movie, I thought this would be about a sasquatch with small feet OR a young little bigfoot, BUT NOT ABOUT YETIES THINKING A HUMAN IS ONE OF THEIR OWN. that's just PLAGIARISM. this movie is just trying to rip off another film that already done this story, it was Tarzan. i mean think about it, it's about a human found by creatures that they think the human is one of their own. i mean c'mon it's the exact same plot as Tarzan except it has terrible unnecessary voice acting, face palming  humour, god awful writing (like Warner Bros's previous animated films/ Lego movies) and even desperately trying to be hip and cool for the new kids with dated pop cultural references and worst of all SCARY CARTOONY ANIMATION TRYING TO BE LIKE 2D ANIMATION!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?! people do not watch this movie at all. DON'T watch something else that has a better title go watch The Son of Big foot, that film has much more better writing, humour and better animation that is more realistic yet artistic at the same time. it may not be a great film, but it is a much harmless looking film than Warner Bros's cash grab of the next unwatchably bad cloudy with a chance of meatballs film.",-0.6488,335

"So far, Warner Bros. Animation appears to be trying to set their tone as a studio as a zany over-the-top comedy piece of entertainment which, as of now, seems pretty enjoyable. Illumination tried to go for that same feel when they started out, but they ended up learning that they could downgrade their movies while still making tons of cash because they know people will go see them. This caused Illumination to not try to make something original anymore (in case you're wondering, their lineup for the next couple of years is Grinch, Minions 2, Secret Pets 2, and Sing 2. God bless greed I suppose).

Warner Bros. Animation seems to be the honest version of Illumination. Their track record is the LEGO movies and Storks. While, in my own opinion, Storks was not that good of a film, but I could admire the originality and goofiness it had compared to the animated movies coming out as of late, and this appears to continue that style. People say ""animation is for kids"", but that doesn't mean it has to be some watered down piece of crap Emoji Movie. You can aim a movie towards kids by just having a good heart, which is what I see for this studio. Smallfoot looks to continue this heartfelt nature that Warner Bros. Animation has been making for itself. It's nice to see an animated studio doing original stories like Pixar and Disney use to do, especially with how Pixar and Disney are about to go full on 'Sequel-pocalypse' on us. Fun idea, promising movie.",0.9871,298
