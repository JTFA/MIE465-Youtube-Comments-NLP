"Geiger Counter You sir are absolutely correct. I have pain from spinal stenosis and arthritis and my pcp won't give me anything but flexiril. I have never had a substance abuse problem and I take medicine properly. If I was a fat cat I could get anything. Also not making excuses but many young athlete's are given opiods for injuries and then suddenly cut off. This leads to them stealing or buying them on the streets. This gets them arrested, more addicted, or dead from an OD. This country is falling apart!!",-0.9718,103
"Hank, Thanks. My girlfriend has been on Tylenol #3 for several years without any incidents or problems, then when her doctor was switched-out for another, the new Doc
                          flat-out told her that he was not going to write/ continue her pain meds any longer thus abruptly cutting her off. We have been forced to go doctor shopping,
                          buying pills illegally (yes I said illegally ) and fuck you DEA Dick Eating Assholes. I make no bones about calling-out the DEA audits that are slapped on doctors
                          when having arguments about writing prescriptions for meds. Doctors are weak spine-less creatures that have no guts for standing up to the Federal Gov. and
                          the DEA about the legitimate use of opioids for established patients. This fake epidemic is going to evolve into a real one when legitimate users will have to
                          resort to more nefarious means of obtaining pain pills. I'm also sick of listening to those god-damn pot-heads always blaming ""Big Pharma"" and  how 
                          everyone should smoke weed cause it's better and blah,blah,blah. Not everyone can smoke pot due to other issues, so it's a jack-ass statement right from
                          get-go. I myself used to smoke weed in my wild youth but gave it up because 1) I found it boring as I got older and 2) due to health reasons I myself and 
                          girlfriend cannot smoke the shit. Pot-heads are hypocrites saying that their one drug is better than another when in fact theirs is a drug,  go figure? I once asked
                           a doctor why don't they all just threaten the federal gov. with a nationwide strike if they (the gov.) don't stop this non sense war on opioids, legitimate users and
                           DEA audits?  Well, he really didn't have much of an answer. Doctors are only in it now to save their hide and to hell with you the pain patient. More and more people
                          will have to start growing poppy plants and make their own pain remedies as the supply of narcotics becomes more restrictive. Unfortunately more deaths will
                          also occur as the demand for pain meds increase due the lack of prescriptions being written and the supply of Fentanyl laced heroin and pills flood the streets.
                          Yes, this country is falling apart and no-one gives a damn. Take care.",-0.9906,422

"I am a huge Tom Petty fan. RIP.   The Media, Hollywood, Police and Local and National gov't don't tell us the truth of his death. Why? Cause cocaine or something other else happen..

Ok, I pray for his family cause this is horrible. God Bless his soul. I and many fans will always have your beautiful music to listen to...love",0.9389,117
I just remembered a Stevie nicks interview where she said the prescription drugs given for 10 years by her psychiatrist were harder to let go of than the 10 year cocaine habit. She also said her doctor told her one more hit re the cocaine could go right to her brain and kill her..so she stopped. She didn't elaborate how difficult..just said it was awful..the whole time she was on the doctor prescribed medicine I'm assuming they were anti depressants..but could have been pstd ones. It is important to know what they are..some of the drugs Tom was taking for pain had Oxycontin in them and phentanol (which I think I misspelled) these are very strong so if you ended up not staggering them properly..you could be in trouble. And like someone said if in that much pain the hospital is the place to be.  Coming down after that much touring as he was getting older..must have been hard also.,-0.8935,182
It hurts when you break a bone. Please do not be so close minded as to accuse anyone needing opioid as using them just because they are addicts because they might not be and you might be. You might need them someday also and let's hope they are still legal even to use in e.r.'s.,0.2023,63
"It probably really was the oxy and that other one fenol or something. He was honest and I'm pretty sure his family was too. There was quite a difference in his health when he quit heroin and married Dana. Around that time he also formed strong bonds with Dylan, George Harrison,..a number of colleagues..i mean he always had friends..but for example he strengthened his ties with his daughters and repaired past damage the counselling helped a lot I bet. I'm sure the smoking didn't help though re an early death.",0.6049,103

"well he had let go of his drug habit 20 years before that and stopped using..and did therapy as well. But, he sure had trouble slowing down..so his body could re-group and heal. Maybe he was onto his way to ask for the ER and just didn't make it to his wife. I think sometimes those pills..(I never liked taking them myself..but after a tongue operation I had to for a few days a while back) they can have a delayed reaction..depending on what is in your system..or an accelerated one..so your doctor needs to know what your life style is and tell the person the reasons why re the intervals..and in my case..they guessed I wasn't taking them and said I had to, at least for a little while. Severe pain can send you right round the bend..but I have also endured it without pain pills in the past. they say that people who have done that sort of drug in the past..if they get into it again after ""drying out"" that is when they are most vulnerable to overdosing. I've read that oxy is several times stronger than heroin for pain..that must have been awful after going through those withdrawals l long time ago..to need pain pills and know how vulnerable you would be.. or perhaps he didn't know. I don't think he had any reason to commit suicide.",-0.9721,272
