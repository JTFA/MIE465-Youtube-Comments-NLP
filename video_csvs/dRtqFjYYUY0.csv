"I doubt that the size of the CMOS sensor will increase to much more than what's already on this phone. 2-3 times, maybe. Bottom third? Pretty improbable. CMOS sensors are affected by yield rates the same way CPUs are, and even a sensor the size of 35mm film (a full-frame digital camera) gets incredibly expensive to manufacture, which is why you only see them on cameras upwards of $2000. While this sensor is likely much simpler and possibly monochrome, I still doubt that it could be economically feasible to manufacture a 5.5"" diagonal CMOS sensor.",-0.0258,109
I feel bad they spent so much time and money on making this happen.  After testing people are going to figure out that while it's pretty cool to touch your screen to unlock your phone it just isn't practical.  Having the fingerprint reader on the back is just way more practical for one hand usage and it would be way more ergonomic for the whole back of the phone to accept your fingerprint than the front.,0.7783,79

It would be cool if the whole screen was read by finger touch because you can do more then just open your phone you could be the only one to send messages on your phone or make phone calls someone is sleeping for example they use your finger to open it then they release private information you won't be able to get away with that if you needed your finger prints for every part of the screen.,0.3182,78
"It's a cute half-thought attempt. Fingerprint readers are already cumbersome enough. This asks that you do all the typical fingerprint gymnastics and then adds the requirement to move the phone around a bit to activate the ambient display (which is still not a 100% success thing on the vast majority of phones). The electrical engineers behind this need to put away their soldering irons, be taught about UX, and realize that the goal of a fingerprint reader is to make authentication quicker and more convenient, not ""cooler"". A simpler solution like the side-mounted FP reader on the Nextbit Robin will also clear real estate on the front panel, without requiring motion detection, an OLED or fingers to be lit. I absolutely agree with MB that ultimately, a display that could read your fingerprint from anywhere on the screen would be amazing but that's not what is being sold here.",0.656,166
