"(Dead to Sin, Alive to God, walking in a newness of life. Old things have pass and behold all has become new!):

Therefore we are buried with him 
by baptism into death:
that like as Christ was raised up 
from the dead 
by the glory of the Father,
even so we also
should walk in newness of life.
For if we have been 
planted together 
in the likeness of his death,
we shall be also 
in the likeness 
of his resurrection:

(Romans 6:4-5).

***(Newness of life): If the believer's identification with Christ means being identified with His death, then it logically follows that the believer also identifies with Jesus resurrection. Having died and having been raised with Christ, the believer should live a new kind of life.

***(2 Corinthians 5:17):Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

***(1 Peter 1:14-16): As obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance, but as He who called you is Holy, you also be Holy in all your conduct, because it is written, ""Be Holy, for i am Holy.""

***(Galatians 5:16): This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 (Dead to Sin, Alive to God. The believer is no longer enslaved to his or her sin):

Knowing this,
that our old man 
is crucified with him,
that the body of sin 
might be destroyed,

that henceforth
we should not serve sin.
For he that is dead
is freed from sin.

(Romans 6:6-7).

***Simply put, a believer is not the same person he or she was before conversion; a believer is a new creation in Christ.

***(Freed): The idea is that the believer no longer has any obligation to sin.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Dead to Sin, Alive to God. Continued):

Do not present 
the parts of your body 
to sin 
as instruments 
of unrighteousness,

but present 
yourselves to God
as those who have been 
brought from death to life;

and present 
the parts of your body 
to Him 
as instruments 
of righteousness.

For sin 
shall not have dominion 
over you:
for ye are not 
under the law, 
but under grace.

(Romans 6:13-14).

***The sin principle is still present and can express itself through the mortal body, the body that is subject to death.

***The difference is that sin has no right to reign. Thus Paul admonishes the believer not to OBEY IT!

***God's grace places the believer in Christ, and the Holy Spirit in the believer. Therefore a Christian does not have to sin, he or she can resist temptation and do what is right.

***(2 Corinthians 3:15-18)<---But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

***(1 Corinthians 10:13)<---There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 (From Slaves of Sin to Slaves of God):

Do you not know that

to whom you present yourselves
slaves to obey,
you are that one’s slaves
whom you obey,

whether of sin
leading to death,

or of obedience
leading to righteousness?

(Romans 6:16).

***(Slaves to obey): Paul highlights the principle that everyone is a slave to someone or something---whether it is a person, possession, or activity, But a Christian should be a slave to God's righteousness.",-0.9955,826

You´re not having in mind two main facts: first one, the dynamic rope takes a big amount of the impact so you can´t consider anyway that kind of ""hit back""; second one, the jumper is attached to a zipline (static cable structure that is anchored to two main structures), which attachment has been previously studied by the team so that the  drop is safe.
