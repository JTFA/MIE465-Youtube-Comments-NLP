"America listened to a lot of absolutely awful, bullshit music this year. I'm so disappointed in music today. It used to be motivational and poetic and at least fucking pleasant to listen to. Now it's mostly utter garbage about nothing beyond sex. I give props to DJ Earworm for at least making something somewhat nice to listen to with absolutely nothing quality to work with. I hope music in America fucking pulls itself together in 2018. I'm sick as hell of listening to songs about how much someone wants to fuck a girl they saw at the bar. I can't even turn on the damn radio anymore. I fucking hate today's American music so much. Everybody has stopped bothering to even take the time to write their own bridge. I don't want to hear some goddamn rapper in the middle of the song. It completely fucking ruins it. While we're at it, add some FUCKING MEANING to your song. Nobody gives a shit about what you do in your bedroom.

This United State of Pop (USOP) is the best in years, quite possibly in the top 3 since 2009 (I think we all agree that 2009 is *the* best USOP, and probably won't be topped). The music flow is great, the beat is catchy, and most importantly to me, the lyrics of the song actually make sense as opposed to just being crammed together like they were in past USOP years.

It's utterly baffling to me that people think this is ""bad"" or not one of the better ones.

1 - 2009
2 - 2012
3 - 2017",0.9712,140

Although most of these songs suck, a small amount of them are great, just like every year. It grows worse and worse because people run out of ideas to use besides the same girl-sex scenario.

"While this mashup doesn't necessarily seem to be the best for me, it ain't DJ Earworm's fault, and it's for a different reason than everybody's saying.

Proximity also made a 2017 mashup called ""Trademark - Pop It Up"" which would sound better to you than this mashup. It flows better and doesn't sound exactly like a cluttered mess compared to this mashup. Well, I found out why.
Proximity used the songs that HE chose to make this mashup, and it was DEFINITELY not based on popularity, because Wolves by Selena Gomez & Marshmello was there even though it didn't make any Year-End chart in 2017 except for Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (41) and the Hungary Year-End charts. It also included Symphony by Clean Bandit even though it never made the Hot 100.

On the other hand, DJ Earworm has to use the biggest songs of the time period and not the songs that he chooses, Proximity was able to use the songs he chooses while DJ Earworm has to use the songs that are popular.

If you still feel like it's DJ Earworm's fault for this mashup not being great, then you try making a mashup on your own, using the SAME songs that he used. All I have to say for now. This mashup receives a 3/5 from me.",0.9449,244
