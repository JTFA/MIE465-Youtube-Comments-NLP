"Friends, The Lord Jesus Christ loves you! He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

Repent and put your faith in Him! 

He will help you in whatever you are going through. He is not expecting you to clean up yourself, or make yourself ""good enough"" to make to heaven, He will personally take you there. He will personally wash you! You just need to come to Him by faith!

Jesus died on the cross for us. He took our punishment upon Himself. And because of this, we are saved. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior by calling upon Him from the heart, and you will be saved. He will refresh, redeem and sustain you! He will also make a Way for us to escape the oncoming judgement heading for this earth. 

So friends, if you do not  know Jesus Christ, please make today the day you make Him Lord of your life. Time is very short, and our lives even shorter. 

Shalom.",0.9888,196
