"55 mins is too long to wait though. If I come home from work,  there's no way I want to be waiting 55 mins for some rice to cook. In short, I don't think these two cookers really compete with each other in the same market segment. The normal cooker is for normal folk, and the other $350 cooker is for restaurant people or people with time and/or alot of money.",-0.2263,81

"Cheers to the lovely chef. I found it strange that as a chef she wasn‚Äôt demonstrating how to get the most out of the cheap rice cooker. After all, chefs are the ones who know how to prepare food well and serve as an inspiration to everyone else. Your comments about rinsing rice were something I had no clue about until I got some Asian roommates in college and suspect most non-Asians don‚Äôt know about either. These tips for making better rice reveal why an expensive cooker is worthwhile. Each tip requires time and skill. 
I learned a few years ago that the Japanese do more steps than just rinsing:

1. Rinse rice thoroughly until the water is clear.2. Let moist rice sit in a strainer for 30-60 minutes to temper the grains (rest longer in colder weather)3. Add water and cook4. When cooking is complete, fluff the rice with a fork to release the steam trapped in the rice.5. Let the rice rest another 15 minutes to allow the moisture to redistribute more equally6. Serve and enjoy!

This process takes a few hours if you‚Äôre not prepared, but with foresight can be started the night before. It makes a rice that has some craftsmanship but the expensive cooker can do almost the same thing. People who enjoy the great quality of rice a $350 cooker produces, buy it because they don‚Äôt have time (or sense) to do it themselves. This is the same reason people go to artisan bakeries, making bread takes lots of time but most people want to use their time for other things.",0.9522,310

"Lived with my parents' Zojirushi all my life for the price of $150 brand new from the 99 Ranch. Moved out on my own and got a $30 black and decker rice cooker (w/ pot lid like the Aroma one). It was hell trying to eat that stuff every day. Finally bought my own Zojirushi for $150, and it was such a HUGE difference. I ""mealprep"" my rice, leaving it in up to a week sometimes. Never worried about ""rice poisoning"" as some mealpreppers always seem to worry about. Rice is always fluffy and perfect. The type of rice you can just eat by itself. I use it to make hot oatmeal for breakfast and porridge for sick days, too.Wash it, press the button, and you're done with it. I work, go to the gym, and try to sleep early.

You only need a pot. Its so easy. I dont like mushy rice and I prefer jasmine rice so I put 1 cup rice in the pot. Rinse the rice like 6 times and then drain all the water out. Put 1.5 cups of water and cover the pot. Then put the stove all the way on high until it boils. Then lower the water to low and until all the water is gone like 15-20 minutes. remove the pan from the heat and keep it covered. Then fluff the rice with a fork. Done. Cuck that $350 rice cooker,-0.6888,111
You should have compared a new 40$ rice cooker with the zojirushi from today. Comparing a 10 year old rice cooker that did not have a computer chip inside is not a fair comparison. The 40$ cooker from Costco will come close to zojirushi and it will be hard to distinguish.,-0.3318,56
