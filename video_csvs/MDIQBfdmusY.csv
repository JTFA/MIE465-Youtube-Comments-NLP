"Am I missing something here? I was making that play when I was 12 years old in my basement.
Yes I had a small basket that was 6 feet off the ground but my friend would throw the ball towards the basket and I would dunk it in. So all I see here is a person who has legs like a animal able to jump 3 feet in the air and being well over 6 feet tall able to put himself about 12 feet off the ground so he dunks it in at 10 feet. So the play I would make was just 4 feet lower and with a smaller ball and basket but it was the same play. I just don't see what was so great about that play other then seeing someone who looks to be part animal in his athletic ability.",0.9834,150

"My friends, Jesus Christ is coming! 

The Lord loves you! He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. 

Jesus also promises He will never drive away anyone that comes to Him in faith (John 6:37, paraphrased)


The Lord came down to die and rise again for all of us, friends! He took our punishment upon Himself! Thank You, Jesus!

Repent and put your faith in Jesus! 

He will wash away your sins, He will make you new, and He will deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

All you have to do is have faith as a mustard seed and a simple prayer from the heart; you don't have to say a fancy prayer, all you need to do is speak from the heart. Those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

Shalom, friends!",0.98,203
