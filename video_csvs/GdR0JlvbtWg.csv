There were a lot of people who experienced harrasment and made the choice to speak up but the world, specially Hollywood, turned their backs to them and let them down, those people, the ones that did something since they knew about this, even without having any power, lost their careers and dreams for that. It's exactly like in the fashion industry, most of them  have experienced or know somebody who has experienced sexual harrasment and even if some of them have the power and platform to speak up (even now that the world is more open to listen about this issue) they reamin silent and continue working with the harrasers. I've seen a lot of times celebs ""standing"" or ""supporting"" certain movements, yet that's all what they do, wear a color, write hashtag on Twitter but do nothing and take action about a lot of problems. Then what's the point of wear a color for a night when in the past you did nothing and will just support the thing when there are actions like last night and the whole world is watching you but then again do nothing.
