"""Im Democrat and support letting the immigrants come through legal or illegal. One of the many points myself and other democrats liked to use was ""They're not all bad"". Basically saying why should we send them all back if only a small minority commit a violent crime when here. But when it comes to guns they want to ban them all because of the actions of a few dumb ass people. That makes absolutely no sense. Wouldn't they also use ""Not all gun owners are bad"" in this situation?""

"Alright, I've been severely clinically depressed (clinical depression is when you don't know why you're depressed) for nearly 6 years now and I have to say this. Whenever someone commits suicide, some people always call them selfish or don't understand why he did it. I'm not sure if this was due to depression or bullying but several suicides do occur because of this and it needs to stop. People are talking about how he needs a therapist and while although I agree, he needs more than that. He needs people to treat him like a person. It shouldn't take someone to be severely depressed or to shoot themselves in order for people to treat them with some common human decency. We shouldn't need tragedy's for people to start caring. And the fact that people just try to throw therapists at them instead of talking to them or helping them is just wrong. People don't commit suicide out of nowhere, it's a decision that takes them an extremely long time of pain and suffering to come to. 

Also, please understand that there's a reason why people don't tell you that they're depressed. It's because they don't know the outcome of how people will look at them or treat them.

Most importantly, people need to understand what depression is. Unlike what many people believe, depression isn't extreme sadness, it's an illness that makes you lose all hope and see everything that once made you happy suddenly feel bitter and painful. It destroys any passions or hobby's that you enjoyed and makes you completely unmotivated until you become too tired to even get out of bed. And anytime you try to go to sleep you just sit there staring at the ceiling and just asking your self the same questions and believing that you are nothing but a horrible person and that you will never amount to anything. For those of you who think that you may have depression, please check with a therapist to be sure. And to those of you who think that depression is cute/cool, or isn't real, or is something that isn't that important, please stop for a moment and educate yourselves. Depression is real, it kills thousands of people, and it is not something you want so stop treating it as such.",-0.9964,420

"The World Knows LICE-METH-HEAD WHITES Lies and Time Are Limited! They are so ignorant and only feel ""supreme"" because they're psychologically brainwashed: You think White Supremacy is going to talk down itself. 1) Where is their evidence to support Jesus Christ and Biblical characters were White, or that Whites possess superior intelligence than others in the world. Whites exploit others talent, ideas, inventions, money, music, work, property, etcetera and claim ownership. That is why I never fill out surveys or do more than necessary when Whites are involved in my meetings, directly or indirectly. 2) Look up Neanderthal DNA or Monkey Rhesus DNA in Whites. Why are Whites prone to more internal disorders and skin diseases because of much lower melanin levels? 3) Google White mutant genes, which are inferior biologically which produce a physically inferior product that burns in the Sun, even with their chemical sunscreen--VAMPIRES. White scientists reveal Whites age more and have more cases of arthritis, Autism, eye seeing disorders(the need for regular and UV glasses)and hearing disorders(the need for hearing aids) compared to Blacks. Why are Whites having more plastic surgery, organ transplants, Testosterone or hormonal injections to mitigate these abnormalities. 4)CRIMES, CRIMES, AND CRIMES: Whites make a declining 14% of world pop., but commit more crime than any race and its effect Millions of people compared to Blacks. Whites commit more robbery and theft: white collar crimes, fraud, ethics violations, political corruption, and extortion. Whites commit more Murder with evidence of the Indians, Holocaust, lynchings, frivolous wars, documented police killings, documented doctors' killings of patients, DUI's, even White on White crime, etcetera. 5) White Supremacists hate diversity because it is ""The end of the White Race."" If Mentally Ill Whites were truly superior, they could thrive in all conditions, among all people because all non-whites are ""Inferior""--right? 6) If White is beautiful and right, why a billion dollar tanning industry, including tanning lotions, airbrushing, tanning beds and booths, mists, tanning pills, and melanin injections? LOL! 7) Whites do more drugs: Opium and Heroin, Cocaine, Prescriptions, Meth, Hallucinogens, Amphetamines, Morphine, and Alcohol. Note: about 60,000 Whites overdosed and died in 2016. 8) Whites are Secretly on more welfare, disability, unemployment, and file more bankruptcies compared to others. 9) There are other sources of entertainment besides Incest, Beastality, Pedophilia, and deceptive superiority, so use them! 10) Last, Blacks are diverted from certain areas of expertise or professions and for good reason. The shadow government does not want black people to go into areas of Archaeology, Egyptology, Biochemistry, Law, Medicine, etc. in large numbers because expertise in these fields will show black people just how fraudulent the world’s current paradigm really is. 

Guys my fingers are tired and feelings may get hurt, but the list goes on with numerous evidence. Elephants don't swap flies, but I'll remind Whites to go back to the cave in Europe to continue dying out, regardless of the Sun!

Nonetheless, White Supremacists, in survival mode, typically will deny everything, deflect, use opinions and circular logic while shifting the blame to Blacks or non-whites. LOL! Like and Share!",-0.9933,646
