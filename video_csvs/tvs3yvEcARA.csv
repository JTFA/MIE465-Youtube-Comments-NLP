"Don't rush to buy a 3D printer, for planes anyway.  This is a very interesting concept. But notice no details given, and the plane is very small. Doubtful this could be a revolution. Reason: WEIGHT.  PLA has perhaps sufficient strength for small planes.  BUT PLA has a density of 1.25g/cm3 [1.25 grams per cubic centimetre]. For larger planes, this would result in very heavy, very unflyable planes. Now contrast this to balsa, which has a density of only 0.16g/cm3.  PLA is thus 8X heavier than balsa!  My balsa planes are 2 metres in wingspan and weigh about 6 Kg.  Using PLA, the weight would be 48 Kg!!  [If I want strength, I will use bamboo, which is 12X stronger than balsa, but only 3x denser - overall very much better than PLA].",0.8705,166
