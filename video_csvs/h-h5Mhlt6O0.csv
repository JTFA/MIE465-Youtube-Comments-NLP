"An old Mac Pro tower with a modded Nvidia Titan and 12 (older) Xeon cores will outperform this in Adobe (Cuda) and Apple (Open CL) software.  And you can upgrade the old tower up to 64gb of (slower) ram.

But, the new iMac Pro looks awesome.  Just as good as any $5000 pc I could build from scratch, but Mac OS really is special.  Windows 10 works, but the bundled Apple software, I think, is better than bundled Microsoft software (in general).  

The integration between iPhone and Mac is better than that between Android and Windows 10 (though it is similar).  The dealbreaker for me is more control over privacy settings, and Pages on iOS, Notes and iCloud synching between my iPhone and all my Macs.  

It’s really awesome to be able to do things that aren’t possible of Windows and Android.  Add in an Apple TV exclusively for streaming media and it becomes even better, enabling streaming content on any tv wherever you are as long as you bring your Apple TV and iPhone (which is easy because an Apple TV is a tiny cube).",0.9842,222

"At $5000 for the base 8-core Xeon W with only a Vega 56 GPU and 32GB of RAM without the ability to upgrade, I don't think this is at all priced competitively. I threw together a very similar build using the Intel Core i9 as the base platform with otherwise identical specs and hardware also including LG's pro-sumer 43"" 4K monitor as well as a copy of Windows 10 Pro, and I still had about $1000 left to play around with. That closed oven of a chassis is not worth another $1000. Hell, you could build another whole system with that. To be sure, I'm not an Apple hater. If prices weren't so ridiculous, I'd consider getting one as I do prefer several Mac optimized applications over others. But, I just can't justify the lack of value in a proposal like this one. An extra grand can add a lot to my workflow. That's 2 more mid-range 4K monitors or another high end LG or Dell monitor; it's a potential grand toward a much faster network storage solution, etc. I recognize that Apple's products are not marketed to value-oriented buyers. Most people who seem to buy Apple products don't really care what's under the hood. For those of us who do care and know the value of each component though, I don't think it's a good buy.",0.919,254

"Hello Marques.  I have been watching many videos about the new imac pro.  Lots of render times compared with other systems.  Looks promising, BUT I am wondering if any of the test were done using EXTERNAL RAIDs, such as the Pegasus on your desk.  It is true that the internal SSD of the imac pro is fast, but 4K and 8K files tend to need significantly more space than even the 4TB SSD.  On top of that, who really wants to use there operating system Drive as a scratch disc?  If you have any information on the performance of this computer using real world situations and external RAID systems, I would highly appreciate that.  I have switched to a Z840 with dual Xeon 12 Core, 128G RAM and Quadro P5000.  I have installed internal SSD RAID for scratch, which gives me 2800 MB/s write and 2900 MB/s read on BM Disk Speed Check.  Do you think I would benefit by switching back to mac with imac pro?",0.9231,188
"Hi,
would you please test the iMac Pro with GeekBench under some of the following scenarios and then somehow report feedback and the scores:
iMac Pro - native resolution
iMac Pro - Any lower non 5K resolution
iMac Pro - with one 4K or 5K monitor - native resolutions
iMac Pro - with two 4K or 5K monitors - native resoluteon

Feedback about user experience would also be welcome. Ex. Do you feel any mouse lag or machine slowdown? 

Apple is going to make a “Pro” display in the following years. It would be nice to know how big the performance hit per monitor/resolution is when considering the initial buying setup. macOS upgrades will also slow the iMac Pro over time… so please test it :D",0.87,138

I also have inside 3x 4To HDD for storage, a hotplug drive bay to have HDD used as floppy disk (30€). I use the classic 27"" 144 point screen , a 5k screen cost 1000€ and is fully usable in 5K mode by windows (not a 4 to 1 extrapolation)
