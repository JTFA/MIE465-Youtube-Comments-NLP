The greatest ever King Arthur's Legends movie... I got the DVD but it's slightly different.... I know when I saw it in the theater Helen Mirren Snips were showing when she was frozen. But in the DVD no nips.
Trust me , at the age of 14 and a half ,  I'll never forget. And I've had Helen Mirren ever since.  10 years ago I saw her on St Marks Street in New York City , as we cross paths she was wearing a tight leather jacket in December... And yes there was nips...

But me seing her in roles past 10-15 years she was just a bloody good caracter actress. I couldn't ""see"" her that way (maybe healthy for someone my age).

"Once a soul is created by My Father, it will last for eternity.
 -Saturday, March 22nd, 2014 @ 14:00

My dearly beloved daughter, death must never be feared, if you accept My death on the Cross. 
Death is only a passing moment from this world into the House of My Father’s Kingdom. To fear death is to deny My Mercy, for I will save every soul who acknowledges Me and who asks Me to forgive him his sins.

Once a soul is created by My Father, it will last for eternity. It will have Everlasting Life, if the soul will allow Me to claim it. Otherwise, it will be lost to Satan should the soul deny Me, when it knows Who I Am.

The death of a soul on Earth is as natural as birth. 
When a soul leaves the body and comes to Me it will be filled with an abundance of Graces and will be enveloped into My Father’s family – His Kingdom, which is filled with great love, joy and happiness, which can never be attained on Earth. 

Many of you, who have experienced love, joy and happiness in your lives, have only savoured a tiny morsel of what Everlasting Life tastes like. You must strive always, with joy in your hearts, for the moment when you will enter My Father’s Kingdom, for it is to be welcomed – not feared.

If you have to face death or if a loved one has to face death then always turn to Me, your Jesus, for help. When you do I will lift you in spirit, wipe away your tears, banish all fear from your hearts when you recite this prayer.

Crusade Prayer (142) Preparing for death

My dearest Jesus, forgive me my sins. Cleanse my soul and prepare me to enter Your Kingdom.
Grant me the Graces to prepare for my unification with You. Help me to overcome any fear.

Grant me the courage to prepare my mind and my soul, so that I am fit to stand before You.
I love You. I trust in You. I give You myself in body, mind and soul for eternity. Let Your Will be mine and release me from pain, doubts or confusion. Amen.

I welcome all souls who recite this prayer, without exception. 
My Mercy is extended, especially, to souls who are facing death, but who do not believe in Me, when they say this prayer three times a day, in their final days.

Your Jesus
