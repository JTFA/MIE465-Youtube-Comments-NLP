Creams are water based and can't penetrate through oil properly. If the purpose of the cream is just to act as a barrier then use it after the oil but if you want the hydration benefit of the cream then apply it before oil.,0.6369,46

You girls made my night 👯💖️Love both of you,0.0,12
"You go in order of viscosity, so mists, toners, serums,, and the like go before a cream based product. This allows for the maximum amount of benefit since a lower viscosity = smaller particles = the ability to penetrate deeper into your skin. Ideally, you layer the oil first and then WAIT — if you let the oil sink into the skin, you can seal in all the moisture with that wondrous night cream AND still get all the nourishing properties of a water based cream. I am assuming the oil you're using is lighter than the cream — if it's not, you COULD switch it around if you want to, but the key is in waiting. If you don't wait, it doesn't matter what order you do them, they will both interfere with each other.",0.5774,152
