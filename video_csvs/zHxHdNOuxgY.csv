"At first she was happy and in love, while wearing that white shirt. Then, Borns is the one wearing the same shirt, while she's wearing black (that means sort of grief). I guess this means that he took her place: now he is really in love with her and want to be with her again, but she's the one that don't really want him back. At the end she appears wearing the white again, 'cause she got over him and turned happy again, without him. That's how I see it. AND OMG, I LOVE THIS VIDEO AND FREAKING LOVE THIS MAN.",0.9756,118
