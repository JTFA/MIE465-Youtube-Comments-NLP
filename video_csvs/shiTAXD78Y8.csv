"Entertainment news and celebrity news is taking a huge part of American broadcast time; more than important topics like the memo and Hillary's collusion with Russia to slime Trump. Fonda almost single-handedly stopped the war in vietnam, something few journalist did much to expose. 

Megyn Kelly has done nothing for America, for broadcast news, and seems to be very evil, even demonic - in her hatred of Black people. 

For a fake journalist who is a racist, to be given the opportunity to attack an American heroine and acting legend - is unforgivable. Boycott NBC.

"Jane Fonda perpetrated absolutely NO mistreatment of American military personnel in the Vietnam War. With that kind of logic, anyone who cast a vote in Congress AGAINST going to war against an enemy and ended up in the minority could be arrested for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Or they could be arrested for voting to end the war before victory. Yes, those actions give aid and comfort to the enemy, but they are perfectly permissible, Constitutional protected freedom of speech. When the country is at war, it is perfectly permissible for citizens to debate whether the war should be continued or not. Fonda thought it should not be continued. That was her right. That is NOT a criminal instance of giving aid and comfort to the enemy. She did not divulge war-planning secrets to them. She did not traffic weapons to them. Those would be the kinds of actions prohibited by laws against treason. Laws against treason don't require us all to AGREE that any particular war should be initiated or continued. This is a democracy and we don't have to agree on ANYTHING. And the right of people to disagree is what pisses off the kind of right-wing militarist jerks who say ""Hanoi Jane"". They don't hate her for anything she DID. They hate her for what she EXPRESSED. That kind of hatred is NOT permissible.",-0.9655,254

Why not, Jane Fonda, be a class act (like your father was) and respond with diplomacy and charm?  Your response to Kelly was cold, sarcastic, and extremely rude (not unlike the panel on the View).

Like Whoopi said, YOU (Megan Kelly) made a mistake (by asking Fonda about plastic surgery too early on in your guest/journalist relationship) and you should exercise some humility by admitting as much.",-0.5067,81

‚ÄúWhose the journalist?‚Äù Haha thank you Joy! I thought it was unprofessional for her to dig deep just because Jane did not want to discuss that at the time. Why poke the bear? Move on and find different questions or topics. Maybe she is over discussing plastic surgery: Good journalists will sense when a guest is uncomfortable and should know when to divert. But this is just my opinion on the subject matter ‚ò∫Ô∏è,0.7802,84
