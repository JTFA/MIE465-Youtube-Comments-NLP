"Recently watched this movie called A Silent Voice. Then, I realised, I am a bully before. Yes. I bullied a girl same age as mine 6 years ago.  Due to that I have been bullied in primary school, I became a bully myself. She wanted to be friends with me but I don't care. She cared me. I heard rumours that she likes me that time but I just keep bullying her. After a half year. Karma hit me. I am isolated. Not much friends. Everyone thinks I am weird. I got beat up several times. Get kicked in the stomach twice. My water bottle and pencil box got hided by those ""friends"" and I got even more frustrated. Time goes on and I became depressed. The once cheerful me, become a guy who liked to locked up in my room. The karma I served made me having constant having flash backs at random time. I tried to kill myself 4 times. Funny, it didn't work. Then, I only have one real good friend. Seriously, just one. Then, I promised myself. Before I died. I wanted to apologize to the girl I bullied. I apologize to her last week and I felt so happy and good. Seriously, good. Now, we were studying at different places. Still, felt that I ow her an apology by face. Ever since, I am totally against bullying and I do believe kindness can solve it.",-0.6082,285
