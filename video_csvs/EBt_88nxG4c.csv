Es una obra maestra de arte que demuestra que estamos en una etapa madura del arte y que no estamos encasillados en paradigmas viejos. Se ven hermosos. Dan ganas de comérselos a besos.

"We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burned so bright we burned out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause

Mmm tough times they keep coming
All night laughing and fucking
Some days like I'm barely breathing
Then after we were high and the love dope died, it was you

The pill I keep taking

The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit, we'll blow out
Blow out

'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby 'cause
