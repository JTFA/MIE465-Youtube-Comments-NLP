"You know, I first found your channel when I saw your H3h3 video, and I absolutely adored it. You have this child-like fascination and excitement about everything you do, you even talk kinda fast and quiet like a kid when they read lines and wear hats I've seen my 10 year old cousin wear. You just give off this aura of happiness and innocence, you don't post on YouTube and make stuff to make money or to push some agenda. You just do what you do because you like it and have fun with it. Watching you is a break from the awful reality we live in, and especially the past few years I've been living in. It's like watching your slightly crazy yet extremely kind-hearted uncle tinker in his garage as he hangs out with you like he does his friends. That's why it felt so awful when I saw your video about your house burning down. As hard as I could see you trying to keep your cool you just couldn't. I'll be honest, I cried during that video and I'm even trying really hard not to cry now thinking about it, and mind you I didn't even cry at my Grandpa's funeral. That's how much it got to me. It's just a total dick punch to one of the last people I'd EVER expect to be screwed over in that bad a way. You had almost everything taken from you, and despite that, despite a situation some people commit SUICIDE over or even have PTSD from (Minor and severe), a few videos later you were back like nothing happened. You joked about it and said things so funny about this horrible event like it was just you recounting a time you fell off a bike. My little reality for you was shattered but in a whole different way then I thought it would be. I realized you weren't just some wacky uncle who occasionally does stuff and sounds like a kid. You were a grown man with a love of your work and family, and even this thing my Dad, who's house also got burned down a long time ago, still hasn't entirely gotten over with how close he and his children and wife brushed with death, wouldn't stop you, and only seemed childish because he had a child like love and wonder of his favorite things to do. 

I know it's easy for YouTubers to overlook their good comments and get consumed by the scumbags saying douchey things, that's why I just want you to know how happy I am to have found you. The only reason I haven't donated all my cash to your GoFundMe is because my parents as it is are extremely poor and I'm an underaged cripple so I can't work or get Welfare to donate to you. And I've never felt more guilty of something in my life. Even though there's absolutely nothing I can do it feels like I'm starting at a dog I used to own and still love starving and desperately in need of help but I'm just sitting there watching him starve. 

I can't help you with money, so the closest thing I can possibly do is tell you this. Please never forget the people who love you, the people who adore you and your content. Once you have enough following even if you're a literal saint you'll still get people trying to ruin your day, (which tbf at least from what I know of you, you practically are a Saint) we love you and just the thought of you being even remotely dissuaded from doing the things you love makes me wanna hop in a rocket-powered wheelchair blessed by you and go kick every person who's ever made fun of you in the dick with rocket-propelled boots.

Also blessed and made by you, preferably.

I just want you to know how  much your fans love you. I've only been watching your channel for a few hours now and I already wanna just liquidate my entire family and my extended family's extended family's houses and donate all the money  to you, just imagine how a fan who's been watching you for years and loves you even more then me feels about you and any potential future or current problems you're having.
