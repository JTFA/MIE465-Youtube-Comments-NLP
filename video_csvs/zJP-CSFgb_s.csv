I think it's matter she made a promise that she will make the necessary changes and she didn't the reason is unethical because we the tax payers funding her paycheck and double standard is not OK.i think the trump administration intentionally putting questionable people into position for a much grater control and concentration of power Dr Ben Carson shouldn't run HUD it's a 60 billion dollar program Dr Ben Carson would have been a better choice for the cdc. Probably there were other problems too but they did not come out publicly with it I think it was unnecessary to prepare the public for a potential nuclear war and president trump taught otherwise. Next week is going to be very scarry Janet yellen. Is leaving the federal Reserve let's see who's going to take her place because there is a 100 trillion dollar plan by the top 1% earners how they going to divide 100 trillion dollar amongst themselves and president trump is part of the plan very very dark days are ahead.,-0.7269,180

"Irrelevant.  She had every incentive to do her job because she was paid to do it; she had every incentive to invest in an opportunity because she observed it.  There is no contradiction.  In any case, the CDC is a useless  and regressive entity that shouldn't exist in a free society to begin with, unlike the freedom to choose and earn a living, which absolutely should.",0.5103,74
"Irrelevant?  Tell that to the ethics board.  They would laugh you out the door.  You can't disassociate ethics from it if/when it contradicts the very message you purport to uphold.  That is the definition of your job.  Buying stock in that which you condemn as a job makes you a HYPOCRITE.  Of course it's not illegal, she had an opportunity to divest - but instead bought more...so she was shown the door.",0.3944,84

"There's no conflict of interest.  If you're going to make an argument based on her influence, then you have to run the numbers:  She bought no more than $1001-15,000 of JTI.  You also must condemn holdings in any company polarized to tobacco.  No investing in fruits and vegetables.  No investing in cancer research.  You see, logically, it all falls apart.  It was a negligible, diversified investment in a company projected to go up in value; nothing more.",-0.9217,93
"There's nothing unethical about investing in tobacco, alcohol, weapons, or anything else.  It's not the government's job to dictate morality.  Americans have the freedom of choice.  Moreover, holding an investment is not analogous to advocating for a company; it's merely an investment.
