"A few facts I would like to correct — during fight or flight responses, the body sends blood to major muscle groups, not the brain. it goes away from the brain, which can cause a lack of logical thinking and headaches. agoraphobia is not the fear or closed spaces, but rather the fear of large spaces. it often causes people to be scared to leave their own house and stay inside",-0.1516,78

"Anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants are shit. Lots of people die from overdose on them each year, they are highly addictive and come with loads of unpleasant side effects. 
I suffer from general anxiety disorder, PTSD, depression and mood disorders. One year ago, my therapist prescribed me an antidepressant for the first time. It didn't help at all, and most of my friends told me they felt like it was even worst since I took my meds. Now that I stopped to take it, I feel much better. I also take benzodiazepine's since a few months, it helps a bit but I rather use marijuana to deal with my anxiety and uncontrollable mood swings. I live in France and cannabis is still illegal in the country. However, it literally saved my life, because using it prevented me from killing myself. I don't understand why a non-addictive, natural plant that never killed anyone is still illegal in many countries around the world, while prescription drugs are still legally ruining lives and killing people. *Free the leaf !*",-0.9819,198
