Alison Conners it’s called a recreation of the dance. Everybody else on the show did a ‘’copycat’’ of the dances that was chosen as well on the show. So why you sound mad? Are you mad at all the other dancers for doing copy cat dances too? Lindsey’s copy cat dance for Meryl and maid was not good really btw.,-0.7944,73

"FreedomMoon I think it's fair to admit that this is mostly for Lindsay who had clumsy non-dancers previously, but they worked hard for the sake of their young teacher  and mentor. Lindsay ripped her butt for her partners to dance in sync and beautifully. And now she finally got a good partner. She deserves that. We had many dancers on this show. Zendaya, Corbin, Meryl, Normani, Paige, Heather, Alfonso and MANY others. So please don't be so rude. Just enjoy and respect everyone who got their lucky ticket to take part in this show",0.9682,108

Just because he has training in other forms of dance does NOT make him a ballroom dancer. You can’t take a hip-hop dancer and just throw her in some pointe shoes because that’s not how it works. You have to learn how to do that style. Ballroom is its own beast with different styles within them. He’s learning from square one just like everyone else.

It wasn't the same jive as Mark and Paige but it still have the same feeling of it and some of its originals moves like the cart wheel move...paige and mark was so good but this dance is even more fast and more superb in technique... And that what they mean by being better.. No offense to mark at all,0.9519,105

"WOW!!! Two great dancers on fire!!!! My prediction is that they will win the mirror ball. I noticed last night how they kept throwing out that Lindsey has no dance experience. I do believe that, she is just naturally talented at performing and is a quick learner. Jordan has spoken about his gymnastic experience a couple times. Sorry, but the dude has got some dance experience too. You don't do that good just by doing gymnastics. Len has mentioned more than once how great Jordan was at holding his frame in dances. Plus since gymnastics does have some dance element to it, he learned there too. That being said, I think the jive was better than what Mark and Paige did on it. Unless Mark can bring forth one big doozy of a freestyle dance and Lindsay and Jordan's freestyle don't match up to that, Mark/Lindsey will win. Mark/Lindsey are kinda limited on how they can win. As far as Drew/Emma and Frankie/Witney go, it will just be a battle between them for 3rd place. Drew and Frankies dancing does not measure up the the quality of Lindsey's and Jordan's dancing by a long shot.",0.9796,228

"Why is everyone harping on Jordan’s prior dance training? Its the same every season.. thats not fair comments? Why? If the producers allowed him on to learn ballroom, whats wrong with that? Mark and his partner Lindsay Sterling are in the same situation. She is a professional dancer and has had tons of training, just not in ballroom.  Everyone has their own opinions, but you don’t have to be rude. I think this dance was a 100x better than Paige and Marks, but that still doesn’t change the fact that Paige and Mark kicked butt, cause they did.. just this version blew their dance out of the water. 💖",-0.5634,130

"i made a bet with my boyfriend, he's team Stark and I'm team FishUponAStar; we reached an agreement if Frankie wins (which i wouldn't mind, he's doing really well). still as i saw this dance i know my team is going to win, i wish i could vote for them but i live in Mexico and i can't (not even on the Internet u.u (you should fix that!)). great dance, better than the original by FAR!",0.968,93

"she is gorgeous and I like her a lot. I admire her work, I think she should win... but it bugs me when I see women less clothed than men. I mean he is covered completely but she has little clothing. I know they choose their clothing with the seamstress STILL there should be a STANDARD for women's outfits depending on the show. otherwise is just sexualizing women.",0.6486,75
