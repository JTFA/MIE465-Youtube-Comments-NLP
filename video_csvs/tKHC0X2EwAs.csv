2018 marks the year of the 40th anniversary of the movie Saturday Night Fever. This soundtrack is still one of the greatest albums ever made. It would be amazing if you could do an anniversary review of this great album produced by The Bee Gees.,0.931,48
"3 seems way harshe. This is a nice listen, and yeah, it's a bit of a mess and there are throw away tracks,  but there are a handful of songs that are like the best thing he's ever done.  I say a weak 7. You have to hear Breeze off the pond and Montana.  I think critics put to much weight on lyrics,  lyrics aren't the important part of a song,  it's the sound before anything else.  A song like breeze off the pond may sound bad if you read the lyrics,  but that song is about mood and groove.",0.193,112
"3:45 too funny. Very funny assessment in this video but also a lot truth to everything he's saying. I enjoyed hearing this take on the album although I may not fully agree. I probably do a good 85-90%. I give this album a much higher and positive rating for different reasons: a 7/10 sounds perfect to me. I would have nixed Filthy and Supplies from the album as it doesn't match the direction and sound of the album. Somewhat catchy but absolutely unnecessary in virtually every way. The rest of the album completes the idea of touching on the Tennessee rooted, southern, outdoor mixing of sound he was looking for to get across with the album with what he normally does with his sound and he even stretches himself musically in some nice ways. There's some nice throwback appeal with Midnight Summer Jam (a la MJ Off The Wall meets the South), some Prince-inspired ""bluegrass funk"" as I like to call it with Sauce, and there are standout jams like Higher, Breeze Off the Pond, Say Something and Montana. 

Lyrically, it has also some standout songs worth listening to that can get truly get LOST in the beat, so I recommend reading some of the songs such as Living Off The Land, Breeze Off The Pond, The Hard Stuff, Flannel and Young Man. I felt the way many did after the first listen through the album but a lot of that changed when I started reading his lyrics and the deepness he was going for. I prefer these deeper cuts he has on the album that talk on some personal and poignant topics. I also highly recommend the interviews that explain some of these songs for deeper meaning. It brings the songs down to earth unlike his past music that were purely pop and commercial appeal. Breeze Off The Pond is much more deeper than him just singing about grass, sparkly waves, ponds and trees. There is deeper meaning that you can read into it and that JT himself actually explains in interviews that shows great insight into his metaphors for the lyrics. Don't sleep on this track as this video might have you believe. Read the lyrics. It's one of the best songs on this album. Quite honestly, this album shines in the opposite of those things which is why the commercial singles like Filthy and Supplies don't really shine at all, especially when he led with what the concept of this album would initially be. It's why Say Something was such a hit when he released the video... it was in line with the direction of what he was talking about with the music. And to tag it on, Pharrell's production allows JT's vocals and harmonies to shine in a brighter, richer way. I'm glad he could get back to that with him for most of this album and attack a new idea and flavor for this album with his southern brother from another mother. 

Overall, it's not his best album, but you will find some of his best songs in this album such as Higher, Montana and Breeze Off The Pond. Living Off The Land is a personal fave of mine as well that has lyrics reminiscent to the advice tone of MJ‚Äôs Wanna Be Startin‚Äô Somethin‚Äô. Love the beat and melody and nice to hear something real from a different frame of reference from him. You can also hear the wilderness meeting pop. Same with Montana. And in particular, that Montana bridge....beautiful. Great explanation he has for it too in certain interviews. Read the lyrics on that bridge. 

Once again, this is a reminder that you can REALLY get lost in his music and melodies and miss the nuggets where this album truly shines. It's like a scavenger hunt, so don't sleep on this album. Find the nuggets for yourself. I like the looseness of sound in Man of The Woods and the slide guitar and its fun hokey feel that contributes to the southern sound in a fun, carefree way, but I don't care for some of its crass, lame lyrics when it's supposed to be a love song to his wife (talking about 'Hey, there's the faucet'). Ahem... NO. Just... no.

The album shines in areas one may not expect but you have to truly LISTEN for it. He achieved the southern, Americana sound with 808s he talked about, but lead with two VERY unnecessary offbeat singles in Filthy and Supplies and stuck in some songs like Waves and Morning Light that sound nice but have major filler appeal. The album could have easily been trimmed down to 12 songs, but being the pop star he is and the distance between his albums, he offered more for the buck.... only problem is, it's not entirely worth it (and that's coming from a die-hard, impartial fan from the very beginning).

Some folks won't be able to see the forest through the trees for this album, but it doesn't mean it's not good. It's quite good. Dude still shines with his great voice and groovability. Yeah, it may not be a word, but you get me. And you CAN hear the southern, outdoor sound influences in this indoor-crafted music.... IF you know what to look for and have an imagination. It's just not entirely cohesive and it's not the flashy album you might have expected. This JT album just may be as salt-of-the-earth as it gets for the pop megastar and as a longtime fan, I can appreciate the change of pace from a guy and artist who's trying to give the people something authentic to him while not alienating his fan base. Trust me, by the time you get through the Woods with the map I mentioned, you can come out on the other side appreciating this album a bit more for the sound and depth it was going for.",0.9995,1096

"Excellent review. One thing I noticed is that the live performances of these songs are so much better than what's on the album. The production is what killed it. You can hardly even hear Justin's vocals on some of these tracks: Filthy, I'm looking at you. Most of these are actually not bad songs at all. My favorite is Say Something. This should have been produced with more of a live instrument sound. I think JT should take the raw tracks and have the thing re-cut.",0.8708,96

He's still kinda candy-assed but a great artist who's now liked by guys too. Very Cool!  Yes the album is a mess. Worst song:Supplies. I pray JT and Pharrell NEVER punish us like that again with such a bad and silly song. BEST SONG:Say Something. Critics ripped it for being too repetitive. The repetition represents being badgered and hounded for opinions,which he'd rather keep to himself. So it's effective,eventhough a little too simplistic lyrically. All that aside,I hope Say Something gets the Grammy for Song of the Year. I think it's that good.",0.974,154

Also, the dubstep-like bass panned to the right ear in Filthy is only being used for the rhythmic quality of the squelch (I personally can't feel the weight of the low end of it, not even if I pull the pre up), while the bass panned to the left is doing the work of the actual bass, so, production-wise, it's not redundant, it's more experimental.

"law of averages says he had to mess up sooner or later lol. while I do like a few songs on the album, my overall impression was that at this point he's topped the charts, sold millions of records, sold out arenas, won awards & now he no longer cares about hits & just did whatever he wanted. I wish he hadn't strayed from Timbaland producing the entire album, they made magic together imo.",0.9313,82

"tripleD24 I agree that it's better than people are saying. There's a LOT of bandwagon hate for the album. But... lyrics absolutely DO matter. If they didn't, the artist would create instrumentals or loop electronic music with minimal lyrics. JT considers himself a songwriter and all albums prior featured beautifully written songs.",0.8595,60
