"Not really true, this just based on the writers of this show perspective of news. Of a ""left-winger"" old conservatives are being normalised, for a ""right-winger"" they see the old liberals as normalised. There are radical voices on either side. However, democrats were creeping towards the radical left slowly, whilst the republicans just threw a far-right bomb. so it seem more dramatic and we all have whiplash from Trump election.

An example of Left normalisation or what should not be normal is BLM, which was given legitimacy, yet many committed acts of violence, disrupting and damaging businesses and campuses. A pair even disrupted Bernie Sanders' speech, but because they were normalised, they weren't removed. BLM were/are destroying property for a very low police shooting rate of black people relative to the population of black people in the US. They highlighted a few cases which weren't justified or were in a grey areas, ignoring the many which were justified or involved a black officer. The fact remains, a black person is more likely to be killed by another black person than a cop, and they are the only one's protecting them from this and they risk their lives doing it.

If your heart pounds from that statement then your ""window"" is inched far towards the radical left-wing side, because any moderate knows that BLM is not a normal activist group. They're too often violent and have no reasonable nor obtainable demands.",-0.9892,274

"This isn't the best example since the GOP tax plan cuts taxes for everyone that pays taxes and will either do one or two or all of three things to all companies in the USA. 
Reduce product/service prices, thus increasing the poor's purchasing power. 
Increase wages, thus increasing the poor's purchasing power. 
Dump more money into the economy, thus enabling more companies to be successful.

Ever since the end of the 2012 elections, this ""Overton Window"" has been pushed the farthest to the left this country has been in its entire history. 20 years ago, Democrats were trying to push for many policies Republicans are now and anyone that made claims they supported things on the liberal platform was blackballed from many industries. 40 years ago they were blacklisted as Communists.
There is nothing wrong with being tolerant and excepting of others. Letting people be free to do what they want to do and giving them all an equal platform to try to achieve from. Even taxes higher income earners more. But when politics is wasted on things that don't improve the financial capabilities of Americans and ignores the facts that in recent years so many are becoming poorer and poorer. When the government ignores those that lose jobs because there are those willing to work below the legal limit and give them welfare, thus cutting that poor person that has to go on welfare themselves welfare in half. When the government instead wastes time telling an entire generation of the most tolerant Americans yet, a generation that race doesn't exists or matter to, that they are all racist and need to be more tolerant and that everything that politicians actually trying to improve the conditions of the country to Americans. 
People need to notice who the tricksters are in politics and who are the ones that want all Americans to be more financially successful, experience more freedom, and finally live in a society where racist is gone. Pick a day, look up what racism means, but a racist statment or behavior requires for it to have that property because it is not subjective. And when you watch some media person on TV or youtube that often calls others racist, look at the original content and see what about it specifically was racist.
