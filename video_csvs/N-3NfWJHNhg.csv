"Aliens are real. They are not what you think they are. They are fallen angels. They are evil and completely against God. 
G√©nesis 6 tells us the sons of God mated with women before the flood. They had giants and heroes of old and renown. 
You ever hear of Demi gods? Think Hercules. Or Gilgamesh. 
Giants built the pyramids .
And the technology that we have today including nukes are fallen angel technology. 
The end of this age is approaching, the new world order is coming together. The mark of the beast is just around the corner. This ‚Äúbeast‚Äù is the global hive that is being created to bring all things together. The mark of the beast will most likely be an artificial layer, think brain chip.

 nearest star is 100 trillion kilometers away it has 1 planet.

The next one has 4 planets and it's 140 trillion kilometers.

It's not likely these metal boxes we  can't identify travelling at the speed of an f-18 traveled millions of trillions of kilometers across the universe to come to this single grain of sand on the outer edge of one of  hundred billion galaxies.
  
  You'd have to travel at the speed of light - 300,000,000 m/s (300 million meters per second) for 4.5 years to reach  us from the nearest star with one planet.

F-18 travels 500 m/s.  

If you were traveling in a rocket at 16,000 mph it would take 1.2 billion hours or 137 thousand years.

  We are so small it is impossible for us to really grasp it and unfortunately our lack of awareness of this inability is poisoning our politics and spirituality (to name 2 of many).

Edit: That's not an attack on any political/religious group, we all lack the ability at times to keep that cosmic perspective and we all make decisions, or become intensely invested in things that reflect priorities of an anthropocentric perspective.

In your frankly pos cosmos reboot he lied about Newton being 'saved' from christianity by science when the actual truth is he was a very devout christian to the day he died and would rightly see Tyson as the baboon he is.
Even Einstein professed belief in Jesus Christ. Cute little known fact.

kingkeefage I know what i said. It was a joke lol,0.6124,12
kingkeefage well yeah I know you weren‚Äôt correcting me. I said I know what I said because i was still going to re-bring up my statement again. I didn‚Äôt watch the video so i commented on the title of the video because i thought it was funny how that was main focus on interview they wanted to show in the title. Not his other topics such as the projects and stuff,0.7351,78
"kingkeefage yeah I didn‚Äôt watch the video. I skimmed through it. Don‚Äôt even know what the whole interview is even about but doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to know in all interviews there‚Äôs a discussion somewhere about projects and work back tf up. All up in my grill for a joke you didn‚Äôt even get? And what I said makes total sense, you‚Äôre the one who has a problem not me lol,",-0.485,90
