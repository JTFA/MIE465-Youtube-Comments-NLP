I'm pretty sure The Room was not a money laundering scheme if you read The Disaster Artist you learn a lot about Tommy and the passion that he has for acting he took a lot of acting class and even took like college class in film or something like that if it was just a money laundering thing he would not have spent so many years doing that.

Looking at countless suicides and financial and emotional destructio of men, the statistics of domestic abuse by women. ANd is there any wonder who it is projected 90% of all generation Y and Z men will never again or never ever marry(including common law co-habitation laws) ? Not really, so I am sure Tommy had experiences with women that ,as with any many over 40 who has been married, will know how western women are,the ragin gynocentric system feminist hypergamous narcissists. Minority are not, and even then hypergamy is the thing. Generalizations are very true in the film! Any many over 40 who has been in a relationship will confirm this.",-0.4691,263
