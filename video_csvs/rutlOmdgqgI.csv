Gotta get something off my chest
Tired of small talk parties with cigarettes
Hoping that someone stops to learn me
We become loners when our lives are a mess, yeah

And we act like we're fine when we're not
Are we ok?
Am I ok?

I know I'm not a perfect girl
But I'm here trying to face the world
I'm broken, you're broken
We're coping together
Everyone's trying to steal the show
But in the end when the curtains close
I'm broken, you're broken
We're coping together
Yeah, we're coping together

Point me the right way out my head
I get so manic keeping up with my breath, yeah
But then you came along and learned me
Now I have company out in the deep end
 
And we act like we're fine when we're not
Are we ok?
Are you ok?

I know I'm not a perfect girl
But I'm here trying to face the world
I'm broken, you're broken
We're coping together
Everyone's trying to steal the show
But in the end when the curtains close
I'm broken, you're broken
We're coping together
Yeah, we're coping together

I'm not asking for too much
Honesty is honestly enough, yeah
And I'm not here to change the truth
Tell me yours and I'll share mine with you

I know I'm not a perfect girl
I'm broken
Everyone's trying to steal the show
But in the end when the curtains close
I'm broken, you're broken
We're coping together
I'm broken, you're broken
I'm broken, you're broken
Yeah, we're coping together
I'm broken, you're broken
We're coping together
I'm broken, you're broken
We're coping together",-0.9938,298
