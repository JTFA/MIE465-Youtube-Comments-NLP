"I am excited to see this movie, but i have some major issues. I am proud of them keeping Aech as a black female, and i do love the fact that the CGI doesn't look exactly real, because if you remember, even with the highest quality Haptic gear, you're still in a video game. My biggest issue with the movie so far is all of the modern references. I feel like they are watering down the 80s pop culture and obscure references in order to attract new teens and young adults to watch it, but if they do that, we are missing out on an amazing movie experience. The book was a tribute to the 80s, and it seems as if they're taking that away. Keep in mind here, i was born in 2002, and i was fully able to understand every reference in the book, and enjoy it for what it was. I will go see it, but i have low expectations so far.",0.9756,184

"I don't understand what some people loved about the book -- to me, it seemed like a mediocre YA wish fulfillment novel. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't anything new either. There have been so many other books that deal with VR and computer gaming (earliest one I can remember reading was Larry Niven and Steven Barne''s ""Dream Park"", which came out way back in 1981). The big thing about this one is that it 'drops' pop culture referencess the way a narcissist may drop names at a party, to gain unearned attention.

I'm ready and willing to be wrong about this -- after all Steven Spielberg obviously saw something about the book that I missed. I hope it's good. But I have a sneaking suspicion that if it clings too close to the source material, that it probably won't be.",0.944,161
