"I am an Indian male and looking at this just makes me hate my country. What is even more shocking is the number of Indian men over here defending their sexist nation instead of condemning the crimes being committed. Some of these people are starting to believe in a myth that apparently western countries have more crimes against women compared to India. They believe in these myths because their knowledge of the situation of women in India comes mostly from Facebook,Twitter or youtube filled content made by a bunch of idiots who do not understand the problem. 

1. All countries have rapes and all countries have a high number of rapes which are not reported to the police . In India more than half of the girls lack primary education. They lack the basic knowledge about law and the justice system . Hence only a small percentage of Indian women who are educated enough would have the chance of understanding the gravity of the situation if they are the victim of a crime. The rest would just keep quiet. The US has 99.9 % literacy rate among women which means almost all women have the knowledge and voice to stand up for themselves.

2. Many people have produced idiotic and untrue statistics in the comments section here . There are many false rape cases among the reported crimes in India but there percentage does not excede that of the real ones . 

3. A recent study showed that more than 80% of the false rape cases in India was actually filled by a woman‚Äôs family members against a man after the woman had concensual sex with the man . They do this to save the family honour. This again proves how backward the Indian society is . People would rather hear that their daughter was raped than hear that their daughter had concensual sex with her partner .

4. A study by UN showed that there are more than 1.2 million child prostitutes in India . They are forced to have sex with dozens of men regularly. Having sex with a minor is rape . These crimes are never reported to the police and are not added to the national statistics. If they were then the number of rapes in India would have crossed 1 million. 

5. Apart from sex crimes such as rapes , molestation and sexual harassment other crimes such as dowry , dowry harassment, dowry killing , child marriage , domestic violence etc are also very common. Every year thousands of women are killed for dowry and millions of teenaged girls are forced into child marriages . 

6. Apart from crimes against women gender inequality is also very high in India compared to western nations . In the Global Gender Index rankings in 2017 India ranked 108 out of 144 countries compaered to 45 for US and 15 for UK . 

7. India is among the countries with the  highest amount of gender inequality. India has some of the lowest rates of female participation in workfore , and the difference between  male literary and female literacy is almost 20 % . The US has more female literates than males . Men in India also enjoy more freedom of clothes and movement compared to females

8. The worst crime against women in India is the killing of the girl child. According to UN more than 12 million girls are missing from the Indian population. They have either been aborted or killed in there infancy. Very few people are actually ever charged with these crimes. There are like a million murderers roaming freely in India . 

9. Despite the horrific scale of crimes against women in India the police is still highly incapable of controlling the situation. This is because almost all police forces in India lack the manpower, training, infrastructure,facilities,money and other resources required to fight these crimes . Hence India also has a very low conviction rate . Most criminals just walk free even after a police and court case.

10. The Indian media only shows issolated cases of crimes against women in different parts of the country. They have failed to report on issues such as child prostitution and have failed to raise awareness about the actual situation of women in India . The situation of women in India is far worse than what our media potrays it to be. 

11. The Thomas Rueters Foundation described India to be the worst country among the G20 nations to be a woman and the UN said that India is the deadliest country for the girl child . 

12. I think it is absolutely accurate to say that India is one of the worst countries in the world to be a woman .",-0.9994,840
