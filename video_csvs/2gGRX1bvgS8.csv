"I think ""The Post"" or ""Darkest Hour"" deserves to win Best Picture! I am glad both of those brilliant films are nominated! However, instead of nominating ""Get Out"", ""Dunkirk"", ""The Shape of Water"", ""Lady Bird"", ""Phantom Thread"", ""Three Billboards"", and ""Call Me By Your Name"" for Best Picture, here are list of other films, I think should have been nominated, in the same catagory:
-""The Greatest Showman""
-""The Disaster Artist""
-""The Promise"" 
-""Split""
-""Mother!""
-""All Eyez on Me""
-""Detroit""
-""Blade Runner: 2049""
-""All the Money in the World""
I think the Academy made better nomination choices last year, then this year. ""Hacksaw Ridge"", ""Fences"", ""Arrival"" and ""Manchester by the Sea"" are good examples in my opinion!",0.978,189
