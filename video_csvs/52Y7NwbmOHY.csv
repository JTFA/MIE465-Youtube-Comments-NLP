I agree it took me to a different world. I felt as if I was in Africa. I also agree with him removing his mask every time. I really enjoyed the villains in this movie,0.4459,38
I agree with your review except the fight choreography. I  thought it was authentic. It was well played and the women was strong and beautiful! They weren't just love interests or damsel of distress liked you said and I enjoyed the visuals! I wanted to be in some of the dream sequences myself. The best Marvel movie by far!!! There wasn't a character I disliked or was confused about. It gave a balanced back drop of Black Panther and Wakanda for those who knows nothing about the comic series without dragging the story line. Wonderfully made!,0.9687,107
"I agree, the movie was so strong on character, story, acting, etc (and YEAH, well-written, human-feeling women characters!), but the fights and CG were a little meh. For BP2, they should get the stunt team and fight choreographers from Captain America: Winter Soldier. Best practical fighting in the MCU to date.",0.3001,66

"I get what you mean about the taking off of the mask, but there was a given reason why their costumes was shutting down in the one fight.  What they was fighting on with the track, it tampers with their costume.  There was a REASON why they showed his face.  The other times i get what you mean though.

Over all i enjoyed the film, they didn't make it forced diversity with having the white guy stupid or a coward, they had every character solid and gave human aspects to them with comedy moments and personality.  A solid film over all.",-0.3674,111

Also, I agree with you; these superheroes are too damned quick to reveal their identity by taking off their masks every chance they get.  Iron Man's got that bad!

"I loved Black Panther. I loved the representation of a superhero who is flawed, but righteous. I loved the strong and fierce women. I loved that they even had one young woman who was left brained and off into science and creating and she did his weapons and they were fierce! I enjoyed the movie very much. It has been quite a long time. I am a baby of the 60s and watched movies through what they now coin Black Exploitation.

I appreciate the representation, but Michael's delivery was off... think about it, he kills his girlfriend, uncle and a few warriors but we as a audience felt nothing. And the CGI was matrix level bad. It's a Wonder Woman for black people. MFs are just too cowardly to point out it's flaws.",-0.91,95
Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger was so Dope. He was the first villian that I felt sympathy for. The Dora Milage was the banger the fight scene in the little hidden casino. Okoye (Danai Gurira) threw the wig...I was too hype..like üò≤OKay Michonne! #WakandaForever üôÖüèæ,-0.1007,58

"This is my first time seeing your review! Really well done. Of course, I loved Black Panther. Even though I rarely go to the movies in the first three weeks, this time I was there on Saturday of the first week. Saw it in 3D which made Killmonger's death all the more personal. Okoye (Danai) was Amazing!!! If I can keep my hair, I want to be her. The mask thing didn't bother me at all. What did was the bigger CGI fights. The smaller more intimate ones between T'Challa and M'Baku, then T'Challa and Killmonger were beautifully done. 

BTW: I love the Jazz thing you did! I played sax in high school so that cracked me up. Love it! I give the movie 9.6 out of 10. And, I'm calling it now: Michael B. Jordan Best Supporting Actor Oscar next year. Danai Gurira Best Supporting Actress, Ryan Coogler Best Director and Beat Original Screenplay, RUTH E. CARTER Best Costumes! And the Music Score!

"Tony I think the reason many people say they wish the martial arts was better is because this is the ORIGIN story for Black Panther. The focus is the African Tribal Style martial arts.

I loved it but, at the same time, I thought they could have worked on it a little more to get a realistic render of some of the scenes at the end! Bring it on some Gollem level type work! Lastly, I felt the same way about the mask! Why the eff do they keep removing the mask?!?!?lol We know what T'challa looks like! Let me see the Black Panther! That's what the movie is about!
