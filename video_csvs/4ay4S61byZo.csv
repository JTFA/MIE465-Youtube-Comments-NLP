Recently Tyler uploaded a pic on Instagram and the caption said 'i got the good side of things'
And in one of troye's interviews he mentioned it being for someone he was with 2 yrs earlier...and making music takes time..let's assume he wrote this in early 2017s and then two years earlier would be like 2014-2015ish 'the troyler era'
In this song he mentions lightly abt cheating...and I think he cheated on tilly with Connie..and now he recognises whatostake he did and apologizes to him..",0.8316,114

Conner unfollowed Troye on everything and hasn’t posted anything related to Troye’s music because he doesn’t want to involve himself. Tyler posted a photo with that caption because he simply loves the song, it doesn’t mean that they had some kind of relationship. Plus Troye and Connor have both voiced that they have been through a really bad breakup within the paste few years. Connor voices it in his second book and Troye voiced it in that recent interview. Plus about 2 years ago is when Conner and Troye stopped posting anything of each other on social media as well. The evidence is all there for Tronner.",0.1045,140
