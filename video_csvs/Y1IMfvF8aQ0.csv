"Ayy yo. When this first started of it was just linkin park. And then in the middle, came motion man. And at the end of it all it was (random name) with a remix. One thing I don’t know why is doesn’t even matter how hard you try keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time. All, I, know. Time was just slipping away and I watched the count down till the end of the day. Watched it watch me and the words that I say. The echo of the clocks rhythm in my veins. I, know I didn’t look out below when I watched the time go right out the window. Trying to grab home. Trying not to watch I wasted it all on the hands of the clock. But in the end no matter what I pretend the journey is more important than the end or the start. And what it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard and got so far. In the end. It doesn’t even matter. I had to fall to lose it all. In the end it doesn’t even matter.",-0.3977,235
