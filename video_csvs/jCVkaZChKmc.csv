The smell is not the best. Reminds me of Revlon Colorstay but it’s not that awful that I won’t wear and goes away once dries.

"ashton lemons Hey! I had to reply via a different account this is my ‘main channel’ and the other is my watching videos for fun channel I’ve had for years! But yes, I do! And yes it is still too pale I would have a look at fenty’s line 100 compared to porcelain in wet n wild’s. I’m literally see-through, and it’s nearly impossible to find a shade that is light enough. At times 110 in fenty is even too dark so I have to lighten it! I’m that whitest white shade companies tend to forget about! But that’s alright because there aren’t many as pale as me out there. :)",0.918,139
"does anyone know why ads are randomly playing in the middle of videos, even if there was one before the video? there was also one at the end here just before the ""have you seen these other videos"" bit. most actually just interrupt the video to play 😕",0.1372,53

i wear this foundation to go roller skating for 3 hours.. i’m usually sweating the whole time and it doesn’t move at all i love it so much💯💓,0.6369,35
i've used both foundations and i must say they seem pretty different! the ysl feels definitely more mat and lighter on the face! the wet and wild leaves a tacky-sticky feeling :/,0.6792,34
l love you 😍💕🔪,0.6369,6
"levi black To me a dupe foundation would be one with close consistency and similar as to how it looks on the face. The photo focus is much thicker than the fusion ink and looks quite heavy on the skin, while the fusion ink looks like skin. I like both foundations for completely different reasons, I wear the fusion ink during day time and the photo focus only on occasions.",0.3612,75
