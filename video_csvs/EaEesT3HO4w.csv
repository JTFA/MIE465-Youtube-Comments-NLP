"@Joshua Knight  Not that I need to explain or justify my comment, your response to it implies you know me and you don't. Just to clarify, I don't ""dick ride"" period nor am I or will I ever be ""a coon"". Floyd has proven he is the best in the league, over and over and over again. ENOUGH, is all I'm saying. Allow him to sit on his throne he has built for himself. He deserves that, doesn't he? I've enjoyed his Career, in it's entirety. Haven't you? ENOUGH! I'm looking forward to see what next he will do.

"Livereater00 Plus, wouldn’t it only be fair for him to fight in the Octagon since Conor fought on Floyd’s home turf? Shouldn’t Floyd fight on Conor’s home turf next? When comparing MMA to Boxing, it is like comparing apples and oranges. You are not limited to punches in the Octagon. There are submissions, kicks, takedowns, and so many other things in the Octagon that you have to be aware of. Floyd is an honest to God really good boxer, but how would he do when he has to protect his lower part of his body when kicks and takedowns come? The fact that Conor trained for a long time to go out of his way into the boxing ring should mean that it would only be fair for Floyd to train to go to the Octagon. Conor did way better in the boxing ring than a lot of people thought he would. Who can say what the result will be when Floyd is in the Octagon with no holds barred? Maybe Floyd can adapt well even in an environment that he hasn’t been in all that much. Who knows what the result could be? One thing for certain though is that Floyd loves to fight and if he ended up losing at all in a potential UFC career, it wouldn’t put a dent into his boxing career, so his 50-0 would remain untouched, so what does Floyd really have to lose by going into the UFC? It doesn’t sound like it would be a bad thing for him at all. He did his work in the boxing ring, and he still has some life left in him for sports, so it would be cool to see him step into the Octagon for the heck of it.",0.8718,336

I'm a no name and go 190lb and would strongly wrestle u down and you wouldn't be able to move. That's when I'd play with u then darce choke u off the earth. Truth man just keep in real.

"This is what's sad imo, Mike Tyson was a much bigger sports figure on worldwide recognition scale than Floyd probably ever will be which is pretty damn crazy. I mean everyone knew who Tyson was (meaning young kids, old people and the general public) and he was everywhere...cereal boxes, commercials, in his own Nintendo game, billboards, general news all the time, Tv shows like Arsenio Hall, newspapers etc etc and his mystique was through the roof...like Michael Jordan. 

I think it's been due to Floyd being vocal, having to underline his own achievements and the amount of people against him. Mr Olympia Phill Heathe has suffered the same exact problem. Also today you have a bunch of sick people in positions of power that should'nt be there and athletes also demand more money than ever before, for instance Nike was advertising commercials starring big athletes all the time and also think the decline of cable television could have a bit to do with it since that was everyone's #1 source all the time.",-0.9042,195
"This is why Floyd is the smartest athlete in history. At the age of 40 years old, he remains the biggest sports attraction in the world and now the UFC wants to sign him. At first the UFC used his name to build up Ronda Rousey and Conor McGregor. And while they were saying that MMA had surpassed boxing in 2015, we see now the UFC running to Floyd (a retired boxer) to try and get a better television deal. Unfortunately, the UFC doesn't have anymore stars. But Floyd will not be used by anyone. He is all about his paper. His fight with Conor made over $600 million (a just about $1 billion worldwide), that is more than what the UFC grossed in the entire year of 2017. Floyd doesn't need them. They need him.",0.6705,156
