It would mean the world if you're reading this and subscribe to my channel. Youtube is changing the threshold of subscribers to 1000 in order to be part of the youtube partner program. I started my channel a few months ago and have around 570 subs. If I don't promote my channel I will miss this threshold by the time the deadline hits (Mid-February). ANY HELP IS APPRECIATED.
