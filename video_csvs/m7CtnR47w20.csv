"For what it's worth, a noise reduction plugin in your post production FX chain will also help a lot. It works by analysing the frequencies present in the noise only, and then removing a portion of those frequencies from the spoken audio.

That won't get rid of the room boom, though. Although you are in a rental space, you can make proper noise reduction panels (not that foam shit) with timber frames, and lean them against the wall. They actually work better if there's a gap between the panel and the wall anyway.

If it was me, I'd throw money at room treatment first. The boominess of the room is more apparent than the noise floor. You don't even need panels, you just need furniture or objects that will break up the reflective surfaces. 

An old pro-studio trick we used to use in the old days was this. Sit where your camera usually is. Then have a friend/wife/daughter move a mirror along the wall. Anywhere you can see yourself in the mirror, you need some form of treatment - either a panel, or an object that will deflect the sound away from you.",0.743,220

"Great video that a lot of popular you tubers should watch. You would  be surprised at how bad some you tubers audio is considering they have as much subscribers as they do.

Also dont forget there is still some improvement to be had with post processing. Using a High Pass filter (mic only) to remove sub rumbling, if the room your in is less than ideal there usually tends to be some low mid mud (whoomfy frequencies  160hz maybe 200hz 250hz) that can be notched out to clear things up.

And for really dynamic people where they go from talking to screaming, compression. far to often some videos i watch will get it to a clear volume to be all of a sudden blasted.

Projection is key for getting good signal to noise. Even when using lapels. Alot of people seem to have this subconcious thinking that a mic only hears whats infront of it. Sorry they dont work like that a mic can and will pick up all round it to varying degrees. if something in the background is louder than you guess what",0.943,201

"Hahaha Mehdi, You're so right - I've had that dillemma on my youtube channel for the longest time, I went as far as making 10 microphones on my own, purchasing expensive microphones and whatnot - I did however solve the problem with noise-filtering. It kind of works the same way as image-noise removal. What you do - is sampling the silent noise of your camera/mic/audio recording, and using that sample file as an ""opposing"" noise-canceling file to oppose the noise on your recording. 

have you heard of OBS? It's a open source free broad cast studio sort of thing to edit videos realtime, you can make live broadcasts AND edit your videos live on the fly, and use a plugin to filter the noise. Take a look at it (I'm quite sure you'll be able to google OBS so, go for it).

Hi Mehdi. Have you ever tried surrounding your camera or mic with a baffle? It's a real low-tech method I use to cut down on noise outside and some echo inside. I have a MUCH lower budget setup than you and find that taping cardboard or plastic around the sides of the camera (for on camera mics) reduces the background noise when recording outside as well as some reflections/echo when recording inside. It kind of makes the mic directional to some extent. Extend the plastic/cardboard from the sides of the camera and as far out in front as possible w/o seeing the baffle in the shot. It's not the end all solution but works to some extent.,0.1027,132

"I would highly, highly recommend an external audio recorder like the Zoom H1 or H2, or a tascam recorder. They have their own higher quality amp circuit, their own built in stereo mic (which is far better quality wise than the on camera mic) and a standard 3.5mm output which (Iâ€™ve tested this myself with the zoom h1) can plug directly into your camera. You can basically entirely bypass the cameraâ€™s bad amp circuit by setting its, gain to the lowest it can get, and raising the recorderâ€™s gain as high as it needs to be. Plus, all external recorders will have an optional mic input, so you audio path could be [whatever mic you want]â€”â€”>[recorderâ€™s amp circuit]â€”â€”>[camera & itâ€™s amp with gain at 0]!",0.9429,165

"Mr. EB, does this rule apply to listening to audio too? Maybe you can make a video on the playback part next.... For example if you are streaming to your cars audio is it better to control the volume with your cars volume knob or turn the cars audio all the way up and control the audio volume on your phone? There are many examples of this but basically comes down to, is it better to control the volume on the speakers themselves or the device sending the audio signal? It is always something I struggle with especially when listening to loud music. One way- the audio can be distorted, while another way- it won't be. But if you could figure out a general best way to approach this for best results that would be very helpful especially to consumers of content. I especially run into this problem when watching YouTube sent to my TV through Chromecast. I can't figure out how to get the best audio.

"if you use voicemeeter banana with asio4all you can bypass what the website says 8 channels. I've made it read 24 with support. 32 asio4all freaks out. that or not powerful enough laptop. max I use is 18. and 192Mhz. unless hardware is 48 then I don't.

and if you set your mic to 192Mhz it's crazy sensitive. mines on 1 or 2  steps below 192 and 10 or 20 out of 30 boost.(built-in laptop mic)",-0.3468,90
"lol... where to start.. Â  a lapel is a good option. Â  Â  2nd good option would be a large diaphragm condenser mic with selectable polar patterns. Â  Â  Â The better the mic the lower the noise floor, the higher the audio bit rate and sample rate quality the lower the noise floor Â too.
Post production on the audio is ideal for obtaining a Â high quality sound,, Â in the signal flow processing Â of; Â Gate, EQ, compressor, limiter... in that order.",0.8271,89

"you can also use. Voicemeeter (easy and simple version) or Voicemeeter Banana (advanced version).

easy has no eq and only 1 virtual output. pro/adv has way too many features 2 virtual outputs, gain control, gate control.

both are donationware. you can donate if you have to money but if you don't it's free. it's well worth it.
