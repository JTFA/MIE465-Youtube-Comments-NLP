"Stephen Curry is taking all the appropriate steps to return to the court as soon as possible. That, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr insists, is exactly why he will not play on Christmas against the Cleveland Cavaliers in a rematch of last year's NBA Finals. ""The guy hasn't even had a 3-on-3 game, right?"" Kerr told reporters on Saturday. ""So if we weren't playing Cleveland on Christmas and I told you Steph hasn't played in a 3-on-3 game, hasn't had any contact at all and the game is 48 hours from now, you'd say, 'oh, Steph's not going to play. But because of the magnitude of the game, everybody wants to know. But we can't let that affect our judgement. He can't play. That would be completely irresponsible if he did.""
