"Chances are slim to none. After 16 technical schools, I decided to get into management. I was told no. No degree. I quit my job installing mainframes for the post office in 1998. At 46 years old, I went and got my Associates in Applied Science in Computer/Networking. 2.5 years later I received my Bachelors in Occupational Training, and Development - Computer Maintenance. No having a decent paying job, I kept on with my Masters in Educational Technology. I needed the money, so I kept going for my PhD. With everything done and two chapters into the dissertation, I was told I was out of money. Rats!  I will be 65 this April. As a senior, I should be able to get back and finish those last 3 chapters to earn my PhD....Hopefully. The deal is that Management positions are hard to get, and hard to keep. I was an IT Director for a school district, then for a small city. Politics can be brutal. The younger generation is made up of arrogant, sneering, snot nosed kids. They prefer babes, and sheep.

"I guess I've been born 20 years too late. I opened my first computer up in around 92, it was a 386 and I wanted to build a CD-ROM drive into it. However, the desktop case had only one free 5.25"" slot, and that was where the power switch had been transferred into (from the back side right bottom corner, where it was located before). So I took out the 5.25"" panel into which the power switch was mounted and laid it on top, just to get the CD-ROM drive into its slot (it was a double speed drive, so back then it was the ducks guts!). Anyhow, I held that blank panel in my hand when I wanted to turn the computer back on after installing the drive (and its controller card, because back then, IDE wasn't even a thing, at least not for CD-ROM drives!) - and I got zapped by 220V, because I held it so that I could touch the contacts. O well, it was my father who transferred the power switch from the right side bottom back corner where it sat inside the PSU (that was back when there was no ATX, so either direct 220V power or nothing), so he was to blame to not having insulated the back contacts of the switch. Anyhow, he transferred the switch back and then I could use it. But still, it was a different time. Learning which drive was A and B by the twist in the data cable (and setting it up accordingly in the BIOS), and all that good stuff. Computers were easy back then, nowadays they are hard (but at least I don't feel like I have totally lost control over them, since I don't use Windows, but Linux instead). So my advice to any newcomers to the computer world is: Get a Linux-based system! And that isn't even enough any more: You also need to learn how the system works! What data is transmittet where at which time! Especially since nowadays, data privacy isn't held very high any more and big corporations basically know everything about you (you just have to hope they never use it against you, which means you can never do anything to harm them)....",0.5448,431

"I started training myself at World Services for the Blind in Little Rock AR since July 23rd although I do have lots of experience with Windows, Linux, and networking. I've even had experience with configuring Active Directory in trial version of Windows Server 2008/2008 R2 and that's about it although it only makes sense for businesses and not for the home environment. I've been running Linux exclusively for about 4 years since November of 2012 until I try out Windows 10 in a separate hard drive for dual-booting between Linux and Windows since late 2016.

Even if I have some experience with Windows Server 2008 and 2016, I'm not Server+ certified. I'm not even certified in Linux+ despite working in my home Linux environment, but I will be working to become Linux+ certified after I pass my Network+ exam soon.

Anyway, I got a 793 for the Network+ practice exam during my stay at World Services for the Blind with 150 questions. I will have to refresh my memory in carrier-grade networking such as Optical Carrier-3 (OC-3) and SONET, but I'm getting there.
