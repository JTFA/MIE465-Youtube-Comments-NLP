I agree maybe he should have thrown them somewhere else but this does not make him a bad person tbh,0.8341,79
The people commenting he's trash and he's cancelled or that he never even had a career are so fake lmao. Y'all know damn well y'all were popin y'alls bussys to his music and were fans of his. (Probably still are and are just hating for attention.) But go off sis,-0.692,55
