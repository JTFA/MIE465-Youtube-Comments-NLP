"It´s not hard to figure out that this retirement has to do with the having to make videos every week to maintain a certain amount of revenue (which is exhausting) and then having to deal with the constant change of the rules by youtube (which is incredibly stressful to one week think you are going to receive a certain amount of money, you plan ahead with what you are going to make with it and then because youtube decided to change the rules or not fix the bugs in the platfrom, you receive only 20% or 30% of what you should receive according to their own rules!)
