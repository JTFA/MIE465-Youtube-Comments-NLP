"This felt so fake - yes it's a show about zombies, but they still need to take into account the STRENGTH of a tiger. This death was barely even heartbreaking because it was soooo unrealistic. She did not put up a fight AT ALL, she pretty much just stood there and roared until the walkers killed her. A tiger would have plowed right through those weak, fragile, rotting decaying human flesh. She could have very easily bulldozed them down to run from them. Yeah, you gotta get the brain to REALLY put them down, but a walker is useless if all of it's limbs are destroyed and ripped to shreds. This was extremely poorly done, what a disappointment. Do they know nothing about tigers??",-0.9642,140
"This is by far the stupidest death scene I have ever seen in any form of media. Even stupider than the Glenn fakeout with him ""screaming"" after falling off the dumpster, and yet somehow they all instantly forget about him once he's under it.

Imagine if Rick did that with the tank in season 1... like once he crawled under the tank the zombies just forgot about him... wouldn't be a very intense awesome scene then, would it?

Like I get that the zombies are supposed to be super strong, but it's like the tiger just stood there and let them surround it.

This was supposed to be a sad scene, but it was so idiotic and tossed in that there was no emotional investment from me. This scene was lazy as fuck.

And the most damning thing is, they didn't even have to do much to make the scene feasible. A saviour could have shot and crippled it to near death, allowing it only enough energy to save the King.

Just show it limping but with more movement and intensity in the scene. Show the tiger getting caught while fighting them, and then show it unable to get away due to a wound. Simple.

This fucking scene is like an amatuer had just enough money to make a movie for the ""Syfy"" (Neckbeard) channel.",-0.9604,252
