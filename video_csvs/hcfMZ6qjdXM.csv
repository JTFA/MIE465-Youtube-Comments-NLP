"More than a name, we need a word for what it actually is, besides robot.
Robot implies that it operates under it's own power, even if it's simply programmed and not an AI.

It's not, though.  It needs external manipulation via magnetic field.  It's use in medicine would require a prone patient, and a practioner using something like an ultrasound device, or perhaps a chamber like an EMI device.

At this point, it seems like it has no independent function.  What would you call that?  A machine, a probe, a magnetic insert?

This is important, b/c ""science communication"" gets so skewed, it can give people wrong ideas through inept word choice.  People have a sense of what a ""robot"" is and does, and there are actual robots.  A Rhoomba is a robot.  This thing isn't a robot.",0.2869,167

"Put a sharp point on it laced with botulinum and a very good IFF system and these things are ready for war.

Scenario 1.  A team of five men have to take a small town with several dozen hostiles.  Luckily they were equipped with thousands of these microbots which they release into a local field.  The microbots then spend the next few hours entering every home and locating every hostile. Then when they are all in position they simultaneously begin to attack the defenders.  Sure many of the men may survive once they realize what has happened.  But for many it will be too late and the chaos will make an attack by the initial five men significantly more successful.

Scenario 2.  Covert assassination of any individual.  These things could likely enter just about any building, or they could be pre placed weeks in advance to wait for the opportune moment to eliminate their target.",-0.6386,167
