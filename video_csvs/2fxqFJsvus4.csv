Who cares if they have a lot of money they still have a right to be upset. They have the balls to live their lives for the whole world to see, could you idiots even imagine how hard that must be and how much of a toll that can take on them. Yes, yes i know you are going to say ""well they don't have to do it then"" yes i know they do not have too but they chose too. They opened up a whole new form of entertainment. Regular tv isn't enough anymore. Young people like my generation we love to watch people living their lives for example we love to watch all these youtubers and them just being themselves in their bedrooms making a video! That is so much more real and entertaining to us then regualr tv. So the Karsashians opened up a whole new way of entertainment. They actually get to make money being themselves! Not having to act and be someone their not. They can be themselves and show the world it is okay to have problems, it is okay to have ups and downs and be a family. We get to watch them everyday being themselves and they showed us that there is a way to make money doing that just like the way youtubers make a lot of money being THMESELVES just like the Karsashians! But apperently to all the annoying people who keep commenting that it isn't okay for them to be themselves because they are rich!? Lmao okay.... ? Shut up rant over ✌",0.991,355
