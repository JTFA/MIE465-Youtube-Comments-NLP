"Wow... it's amazing how fast these people forgot what it's actually like to be a teenager. Unless caricaturing teenagers is the point, cause hasn't been done to death. Teenagers do not have speeches prepared about how much they are in love. This conversation would be stretched out over a long period of time. Lots of yelling, frustration of not knowing how to express your thoughts, storming off in a huff, awkward silences until you needed something from your parents, one of the individuals getting tired of the hassle and finding a connection with someone else, ultimately ending the relationship to be with them while the other has a nice cry in the shower...
