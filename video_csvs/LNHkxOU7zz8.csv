"Best song of 2018 so far imo... this is on repeat for me daily... too much swag, too much style, awesome beat, nice lyrics. Too much to mention... I’m singing this song when it’s playing or not. Respect to Montana from Dubai! You a beast akhe (brother).
More songs like this please!! We need this spirit and style to come back, we don’t want to hear about money, cars and bitches anymore... bring back uplifting and thoughtful music please. ✌️",0.9591,105

"This song hits hard- now and days it feels like all that everyone is striving for is self recognition and spot in fame. They no longer care for real love, or a chance to live a simple life happy, they just want more of what fame they gain doing unnecessary things.  cherish them, .Now and days its easy for someone to be persuaded away from you by popularity or breadwinings. Sad but god this song is so touching",0.9331,86
"Though you may not fully understand your purpose, your part is just as important as the greatest kings and queens of this planet. Some feel as though their temporary lack of wealth or influence makes them powerless to create change. But does a clockmaker favor the larger gears over the smaller? Does the hour hand become jealous of the minutes because it turns slower? Every part has a role in the functioning of a timepiece. Every part supports those around it in ways it may never see. Your absence would undo the Order of our universe, even if you do not realize your importance. The world began before you and will continue after you, but it will be different because of the decisions you made. Every generation inherits the world left by the one before it, just as a king inherits the crown of his father. Your pursuit of wisdom and goodness could lay the foundation for your great-great-grandchild’s rise into power – the same descendant who might steer a country from war and save lives by the millions. Did the ancestors of Aristotle or Alexander The Great know who their actions would create? Though you will never understand the full influence of your actions, the results of your dedication to humanity are still yours to claim. As you climb the great Pyramid seeking the Light at its top, you will look down and see that you are an integral part of our universe’s most intricate mechanism. Though our human members may perish and fade into the annals of time, the Illuminati will continue to stand into eternity. Kindly contact us on whatsapp for more information +2348120189503",0.988,304
