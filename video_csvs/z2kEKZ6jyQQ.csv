"FOR THOSE WHOM DON’T BELEIVE SEAN CARTER IS ATTACKING RELIGION READ THIS: His intentions are very clear lol. He’s previously admitted to the claims I brought forth, so no assumption is needed. If we were back in the early 2000’s, when he was still scratching the surface, further analyzation may be warranted but almost 20 years later..after a montage of albums and constant religious banter, it’s pretty clear. It’s not a hypothesis..it’s facts at this point. Here are three points to consider:
1. Sean first admitted that he had never been spiritually enlightened nor read a bible during the studio filming of  “Lucifer”. He then went on to admit that he beleives in God, but doesn’t beleive in religion (specifically Christian, Jewish and Muslim) during a Hot 97 interview with Angie Martinez in 2010.
2. Sean openly admitts he does not beleive in religion, yet he goes on to exploit religion more than any other artist in the hip hop community to date. From song content, to song titles and even his stage name, he has consistently borrowed  scriptural references that are directly tied to the same “religions” he claims he does not support. Christianity appears to be his least favored, as most of his ill references are cited from the Bible. He has managed to do this with every single album since the Blueprint. He has sought to defile every aspect of a culture that he does not beleive, in an obssesive manner..naming himself JHova (the father) and Kanye Yeezus (the son). Why call yourself JHovah if there is no real significance in the name? If he honestly felt that particular name does not resonate unparalleled greatness, I can assure you he would not be using it. But the fact that he does, indicates a more sinister motive and further proves that he has total disregard for those whom take such an act seriously. It’s downright inflamatory to mock a persons religious beleifs and then have the hypocritical nerve to always be on the defensive about how people process his hateful art. I suppose he feels that in order to embrace his beleifs he has to trash religion, altogether. He is expressing hatred and condemnation for a culture he doesn’t even understand as opposed to allowing others to respectively practice their beleifs peacefully. There has got to be a more tactful way to express himself. In the art of war...When you go against something, it’s only wise that you actually study whatever it is you are challenging. This remedial genuis is running out on the field with an empty clip and absolutely no knowledge about his opposition. Not too bright. He’s the bully that cries wolf. If he doesn’t beleive in it..and it doesn’t belong to him...he shouldn’t be touching it and that’s simply it.
3. Fast forward to this Family Feud video. Once again there’s heavy usage of symbolism. Once again a dark spiritual undertone is cast. Once again he uses many “religious references” ..over a fake gospel sample..and this time goes so far as to slander the names that millions of people deem holy. Calling upon Allah, while referencing himself as JHova in the middle of a Catholic Church?  It’s just overkill at this point. How many times he gonna film the same slanderous movie? Last album he was likening himself to a holy grail, remember? So, Ask yourself...is any of it necessary? Especially since he doesn’t beleive in it anyway. Why is there oversaturation of religion in his content? If I don’t beleive in the KKK, I can assure you that I’m not gonna rename myself so that I could be forever identified as Grand Wizard Angela...unless I were attempting to mock or either wanted dominion over that persona. His zeal for narcissism is so riduculous that his poor wife boasted the disclaimer “I am not God” during their marital rift. Perhaps for  a moment she saw past his erroneous ways. Perhaps she grew tired of self-seeking worship projected by a deeply flawed man whom lacked the basic integrity to uphold the sanctity of his vows. It’s taken him 48 years just to learn practical wisdom. He just figured out that you shouldn’t defile your marriage two weeks ago and now two weeks later he’s so spiritually enlightened he attempts to debunk religion and lead a nation of souls with this fairy tale dynasty as a replacement? Straight crazy. He’s remedial and despearately needs to get out of the soul business and you folks need to start paying attention to what you feed your spirit. The fatal flaw in his plan is that the true God is very real, is far more superior than our understanding and his Word is seamlessly tied into a religion that identifies his true worshippers. By way of religion the true God separates the weeds from the wheat and the sheep from the goats, so to speak. Nothing can change our creator's grand design, so not only is Sean picking the wrong battle..but he's riding swiftly into unchartered territory with the same muster and unscrupulous might as Absalom. Sean Carter is not this super intelligent being as he has the tendency to constantly try to impress upon the minds of unsuspecting ones. There is a reason why he has not found pride in using his own name. This includes both of his stage names. He’s always been a hijacker of those he secretly idolizes. So why do you think he continues to do it? The message he is attempting to send to the religious community is extremely clear: He wants to fight us after school lol. Trust me. We know his position. He’s not hiding..and we aren’t neither. Unfortunately this is a battle he is going to lose. Some simple men really do just sell albums. My expectations stop there.",-0.9554,1145
