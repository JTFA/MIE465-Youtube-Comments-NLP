"Sincerely,  to all of you people supporting Apple. You are truly and without a doubt, an integral motivating component, in making the world a worse place for us all.  You set a precedent that we as consumers aren't deserving of respect,  and that we can be manipulated,  and told what to buy. That we don't care about our hard work. Our data.  That we don't care about the capacity to repair,  control,  or own our own property. That we as consumers will support them slowing down software intentionally without a fuss.  That we are apathetic sheep,  to be fucked with. I understand Apple.  I can see the value in what they do. They are a business. A very large one. What I can't understand is how human beings like yourselves , both affluent and creative, capable and critical, could give so little fucks about your own worth.",0.3214,170
