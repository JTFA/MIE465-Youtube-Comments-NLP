Why can’t we ever share Joy? Why is there always hate & judgement almost every single day? It’s ridiculous. It really is. I just don’t understand why people are so damn heartless, & low nowadays.

"A message to those people who disliked this video.
You all are sick minded bastards with clearly no life and is stuck up your own fucking holes. How would you feel if your mother or father just passed away in front of you? You all are little pricks with a disrespectful heart and I fucking disgusting attitude towards other people’s feelings. I sadly don’t have any grandparents at the moment. They passed away when I was very young. It was horrible. The vibe around the house and the town that I live in was horrendous. So if you’re reading this and you’ve disliked the video, then I suggest you sort your worthless fucking life up and change who you are, you sick minded bastards. Fuck you all",-0.9914,146

I mean, I could be wrong though",-0.9675,65

When my Dad was dying and his pain was being eased by morphine the Doctors told us they didn't know how much he was aware of but I was fortunate to have a few final moments with him where I was able to tell him how much we loved him, how grateful we were for all he had done for us and what a fantastic Father/Grandfather he had been. I leaned over and said 'Niamh and Stuart love you so much Grandad and Niamh sends you a tap, tap, tap' and I gently tapped on his forehead. His eyes rolled back in his head and he managed to nod. I can't tell you how much comfort it has brought me that he heard. Your Mum might not have been able to show you but don't you doubt for a second that she felt your '3 squeezes'. She knows. I send my heartfelt best wishes to you and your family - I have no doubt she as proud of you where she is now as she was when she was on this earth because you bring such joy, light and laughter to so many people.

"Paula Hyland I wasn't making judgement, I was simply stating that, comparably, Prince was much more influential of a person. Undoubtedly Jimmy thought his mother was infinitely more important than Prince but we all think that of our mothers. I wasn't saying that the death of Gloria meant nothing because it obviously meant a lot to Jimmy but from the rest of the nations standpoint, Prince's death was a much bigger deal. All deaths are meaningful because all lives are meaningful but the question was why spend so much longer on Prince's death and the simple answer to that is because of all the reasons I have already stated",-0.8887,116

"all these people in the comment section how mothers are the best and a blessing and all that. well, so are fathers. just because jimmy's mother passed away, as sad it was, doesn't mean that fathers don't care about their kids and want them to do well. both mothers and fathers want that for their kids. at least jimmy had his mother alive with him until he 43 years old. some people have lost their mom or dad before they were teenagers.",0.7765,91
