"It won't really matter in the near future. The world will be so over-populated, supply can no longer meet the demands of consumers. Because of our greediness, many types of plants and animals (including marine life) will be scarce or probably wiped out of existence. The animals that we see now may no longer exist probably during our grand children's lifetime. It won't be a surprise to me if somebody or some country will start a war because of the supply issues that we will be facing in the future. Another Hitler who will go through the motion of genocide.
