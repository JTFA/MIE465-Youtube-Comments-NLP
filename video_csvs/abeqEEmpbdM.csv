"I believe there is true science and fake science, or scientism, a fake religion disguised as science. For the most part what the mass media teaches is false in order to hide the existence of God. I personally believe the Bible is 100% truth and that more recently with the release of television since the 1920's they have managed to lie to everyone, the created televisions exactly for the reason of mind control. There's patents and all kinds of proof of this info/facts. I haven't met Jesus my self, but I think he is God, he created everything because he was bored and we're here for his purpose. I've been doing lots of research to disprove or to further prove and from what I can find is that the book is all true. How would those men thousands of years ago be able to predict so many years ahead is beyond me, it's not for me to understand because I didn't create life, but the breather of life does understand, so I just have to have faith. While doing flat earth research I realized how lost most Christians are, actually most are fake Christians, they believe a lot of lies, but that's not to say their aren't real Christians out there. Also I started to understand the Bible better and learn so much awesome stuff along the way. I believed in the globe lie for 37 years, and once I learned this info it really improved my existence and my being, I don't get depressed anymore and I don't waste my time thinking about vain things like girls and cars and just so much shit that doesn't really matter. Plus I found out about things like how to see through lies, it really improved my being in that I'm not as trusting anymore, so I don't get screwed over like I used to get screwed before when I was too trusting or gullible because I didn't know any better. I'm still doing research but overall I would recommend everyone do research because the government can't be trusted and if they know the truth, which they do, but keep lying to us, there must be a reason, it's up to us to figure out what that is and also to stand up against the system, doing research just helps over all to stand up against this evil, all those bastards are players and they can't be trusted, they playing us like a fiddle, television is just mind control. I remember growing up I used to watch a lot of Disney and Nickelodeon and well that shit just fucked me up, and I didn't realize for so many years why my life was going the way it was going until I started to do the research and things started to add up. Luckily I didn't die before learning this stuff or I would have never known, like a lot of people who get brainwashed and never wake up from the ""american dream"". It's very liberating and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Along the way you may go back and forth and change your mind about stuff, like oh maybe hitler was a good guy, oh no he wasn't or so many other things, but then when you learn even more you end up being able to see what up much faster, just have to keep going and know that nothing is set in stone, facts are facts, and history has been rewritten, but those who re-wrote it aren't gods they just people and people make mistakes, so we just have to find their mistakes and dig around the haystack for that needle, truth is like a drug, once you find it you want it more and more.",0.9684,685

"I understand they tell us that we have GPS because of satellites, but if there are so many satellites up there in ""space"" then how come we never see or hear about any of them crashing? and if there are really satellites up there then why do we need all these towers? I know they use the towers on the ground to do the GPS. There are lots more questions that can be asked. How come all the images NASA and other space agencies show us are CGI(Computer Generated Images)? and How come after all these years we don't have a real image of the ""globe"". There is such a thing as true science and fake science. It is also possible to lie with mathematical equations. Lets look at this simple problem in basic algebra, if we have a half a cup of water, we can say that it is half empty and half full. Let's say E is for empty and F is for Full. 0.5 E = 0.5 F, that is a true statement in math and in real life, but what happens when we multiply that by the number 2? In math we validate the correctness of an equation by multiplying both sides by a number. So then if we multiply both sides by 2 we should have the answer. 2 * 0.5 E = 2 * 0.5 F this in math is a correct result, but in real life, an empty cup doesn't equal a full cup of water. This goes to show that Einstein could conjure up a equation that in mathematics and imagine it is true, but when we look at it in real life it doesn't make sense. Please do some research, here's a link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOGa8OQzjQ4&index=9&list=PLYI8318YYdkCsZ7dsYV01n6TZhXA6Wf9i Please watch the other videos in the playlist too. There are so much more question we could ask, it's just a matter of doing research to answer them! If there is such a thing as gravity then why is it picky what should float and what should stick to the ground? Why does a helium balloon float and an apple falls to the ground? If the earth were really a globe then there would be a curvature we could measure in real life and if it were a globe then a person at the north pole would weight less than a person standing at the equator. If you throw a wet tennis ball why does the water traverse to the center and fly off of the tennis ball and not on the spinning globe? If we were spinning then why don't we feel dizzy all the time? check out these other videos! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeIGrEtPMmE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARp2j8t3O8Q",0.4131,487
