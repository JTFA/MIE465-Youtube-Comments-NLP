"(Cussing ahead)
One time me and my mother were going on Spirit from Colombia back home, and the fucking ticket lady wouldn't let us get in the plane because our handbag was too big(not true it fit in the measuring box thingamabob) and the plane was getting ready to leave. At this time I was about 8 or 9 years old and.. I started crying because i thought since the lady wouldnt let us on the plane we were never going home. My mother even went up to the manager but she was all like ""Sorry but Its not my job or problem."" Me and my mom were both mega pissed at these bitches. Then, this really nice man offered to take our handbag on the plane, and THE FUCKING TICKET LADY LET HIM GO ON THE PLANE!! Then, we go up to her and she's all like "" thanks for choosing spirit. Have a nice flight"" finally letting us on the plane. I was so ready to be like bitchimafuckyouuphereandyou'retellingustohaveanicedaywhattheactualhell, if i wouldve known those words, but my mom like a wrecking boss turns around and says""Don't worry, because the best flight that we are gonna have is not going to be with this airline."" #roasted. So we hurried on the plane, the man gave us back our handbag, we flew home, and never rode on that airline ever again. My brother girlfriend went on the airline a few years later to visit us, and after boarding, the flight wouldnt take off. After 4 hours of waiting, the flight lady said that the flight was cancelled, no refunds,and they were stranded. She and another lady with son had to take uber all the way from fort Lauderdale to orlando. I loved this video, because more people agree that spirit airlines is a piece of horse bullshit, and its true.",0.9874,355
