"""Call If You Need Me""

I love you in the morning when the blood runs to your cheeks
Babe, you are the first thing and the last thing that I'd see
I was just a boy striking matches upon your heart
I couldn't get no sparks
Ask me to go faster, put my foot down to the floor
Standing at the edge, I feel like I've been here before
I loved you in the darkness and I loved you in fluorescent light
If it don't feel right, babe

You can run and hide, babe
Like a bird you can take flight
If I've been holding on too tight
If I've been holding on
Mmm, oooh
Oooh, oooh, ooooh

Your mother always told us we should go out to the dance
You can't get struck by lightning if your not standing in the rain
Take it as the truth or you can take it with a grain of salt
If it don't work out
You were in the shower we were talking through the glass
Packing up your suitcase, you were humming to yourself
One day you were smiling
I could tell by how you sounded on the phone
Yes, I'm coming home, babe

I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home
Mmm
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
Mmm

Dear Friends did you know that Jesus Christ has a perfect plan for your life? But it is up to you to allow Him to come into your life. He won't force you. He must always be invited. It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your trust in Him so that He may lead you and guide you throughout your whole life on earth and also prepare you for the glorious and wonderful day when you receive your great reward in Heaven. He so eagerly wants you to come to this realization dear one. He truly does. Make today your starting point with our loving Creator that will last forever. May God bless you in the MIGHTY name of Jesus Christ our Savior. ❤️❤️❤️  (2 Timothy 4:8;  Ephesians 2:6;  1 Peter 5:4;  Luke 6:23;  John 3:16;  John 14:3),0.9949,172
