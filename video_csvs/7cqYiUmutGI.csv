"To the sauce, you could also add a whole basil leaf and some dried parsley in the place of the oregano. If you don‚Äôt have a blender you can use tomato sauce and chop up the basil. Also to avoid those bubbles it‚Äôs best to use a pizza stone and pull the pizza out occasionally to pop the bubbles as they form. Never use a set time, it‚Äôs best to let it cook until it looks done, once you do it enough you‚Äôll know what it looks like.

Also a tip on the calzones and Stromboli, you can cut a few holes in the top to allow steam to escape to get a much better cross-section.
