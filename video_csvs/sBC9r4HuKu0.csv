Who pays attention to critical fans. And how you don't know that Lonzo didn't speak to his dad. I heard Lonzo state that his father is going to speak his mind. A son cannot control his father. Duh! And you want Magic to speak publicly so you can continue discussing this stale news story. Nope wouldn't even buy into that. If Magic has an issue then he should speak with Lavar privately and keep it private. As long as Lonzo was not speaking negatively to the media I wouldn't care. Lavar is going to be Lavar.

Its obvious Magic does not want Luke to be the coach. Magic did not hire Luke Walton and Luke is not a good coach anyway. These sports pundits always talking about Lavar Ball and not the lousy job that Luke Walton is doing. The pundits never look at the coaching of the Lakers but always talk about the players as if the players are coaching themselves. I think that LaVar Ball knows enough about basketball to see that the Laker coaching is weak. LaVar has 3 sons ¬†that are very talented at basketball. He has to know more about basketball coaching then Stephen A Smith who has no sons that are even close ¬†to playing any professional basketball.

Why should anyone care about what Reggie Miller says about anyone or anything? He has been harsh in his assessment of the Ball family as a whole.
