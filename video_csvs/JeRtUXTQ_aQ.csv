"Don't know what to say to you now
Standing right in front of you
Don't know how to fade in and out
Don't know how to play it cool
Lose a little guard, let it down
We don't have to think it through
We've got to let go

I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love

Tried to call you to feel you close
From a runway in Tokyo
Let's leave the atmosphere, disappear
There's always something left to lose

But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna give you wild love

(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)
I wanna give you wild love
(Love, love, love)
I wanna give you wild love
(Love, love, love)

Let's be reckless, unaffected
Running out until we're breathless
Let's be hopeful, don't get broken
Let's stay caught up in the moment

I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna say I wanna give you wild love
Give you wild love
Wild love

You can't even hear his actual voice. Garbage. R.I.P.",-0.4588,22

"First listen I wasnt impressed. Too use to his old style.  Now i find myself humming the chorus every 5 mins. Damn you James bay, and your beautiful songwriting!",-0.1645,34
"For me, James Bay just got interesting. Love this.",0.7845,12
"Found James on SoundCloud five years ago. My favorite song of his was Stealing Cars. Move Together, Need the Sun to Break, We Were on Fire - all incredible tracks. I couldn't get enough of him. His fiery passion in the way that he sings, the depth and realism of his lyrics, ugh, it was fucking perfect. Let It Go and Hold Back the River were perfect transition tracks for his rising pop stardom. 

This shit? Way too fucking far. What the actual fuck, James? I HATE when people bitch about artists ""selling out,"" ""changing their sound,"" ""going pop,"" etc. Hate it. Because most of the time that hate isn't warranted; most of the time, those artists' core still shines through despite the changes. This? Nah. I don't fucking think so. 

Of course, that's just my take on it. I don't feel James' heart in this. This is not the James Bay I've known and loved. People are allowed to change, because that's what people do. But there's growing, changing, shifting, evolving into a new person - and then there's (you guessed it) selling the fuck out. Maybe the music itself isn't bad. But it sure as fuck leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

What the fuck happened to you?",-0.9653,260

"I know musicians evolve in their sound over time, but this just seems a bit too ""mainstream"" and over-processed for James. It doesn't suit his naturally beautiful voice. All he needs are his vocal cords and a guitar to sound perfect...not all this.",0.7469,51
