"Great video as always. BTW, I can't figure out this problem. Finally posting this on a mathematically inclined group as no one on the Internet seems to be willing to answer this. Actually I'm appearing for an important test and it would be very helpful for me to know some facts. Based on current performance analysis on mock tests, my guesses are likely to be correct 50 percent of the times(ie, 50 percent chance of getting an Mcq correct or 50 percent accuracy) in a 4 option multiple choice question exam (mcq type exam) of total 300 questions, with 4 marks awarded for a correct answer and 1 mark deducted for every wrong answer. This 50 percent accuracy is for the 1st 250 questions I attempt which I tend to get right in the above mentioned percentage. For the next 50 however, upon guessing I would be right no more than a random chance of 25 percent. Then what is the optimum number of questions I should attempt to get the maximum marks, while getting the minimum negative marks? And what would that value be for a range of 40 to 60 percent accuracy for the first 250 questions ? I apologise if my question seems too complicated, as I myself am flummoxed by it. Would it be best to answer all, as the marking scheme seems to favour guessing? Thanks in advance for indulging in the cerebral effort.",0.9247,263

"I have a challenge for you:
I call it the Kalen challenge (don‚Äôt ask about the name).
You have to find a number that is divisible by a formula formed by numbers from 0 to 100 or just the number (include the zero!). 
For example: 
9900 divided by 100= 99
9900 divided by 99=100
9900 divided by 3x3||3=100

For the ecuations, you can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, brackets, powers (they have to be of the same number), roots (the same number, so I don‚Äôt see much utility), concatenation, factorials (the ! thing) and points of the same number (12.12). 
You‚Äôre also not allowed to do formulas that always give the same result, like (n+n) divided n, which always equal 2, and you‚Äôre not allowed to use the number 0 as the answer to the challenge, since that number can be divided by every other number. 
A tip is for the last two digits to be 00, which immediately makes it divisible by 100, 10, 5, 4 and 2.
