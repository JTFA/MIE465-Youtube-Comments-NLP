Repent and put your faith in Him! 

He loves you! He is not angry at you, and He does not hate you! 

The Lord came down to die and rise again for all us! Hallelujah!

The Word says in John 3:16 (paraphrased) that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Jesus also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him (John 6:37, paraphrased)

So friends, make Jesus Lord of your life today! He will wash your sins away, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. He already took our punishment on the cross for us, so please accept this Great Gift from God! 

All you have to do is call upon Him from the heart and you will be saved! (Romans 10:13)
No fancy prayer required! Just speak from your heart. You don't need a lot faith, either. A small mustard seed size faith will do!

Shalom!",0.9914,215
