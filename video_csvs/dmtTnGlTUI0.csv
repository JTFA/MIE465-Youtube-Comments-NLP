"To whoever this may be of concern, 
 Firstly I recently stuck on to this song by this gem of an artist and man I'm a fan of her now.
 Secondly, I like this song too damn much and it irritates me to find distortions in the music file. If anyone or the concerned wants to check, then please listen to the song from 1:00 to 1:30 on a good pair of earphones with reasonable bass and you'll find the ends of every beat distorted.
 I've tried to listen to it on different platforms but everywhere it's the same. :(",-0.5994,106

"We had it good, you know
I spent like six years
Making sure you came home to love
You had it good, you know

I stood by your side
I spent up so much time
Try to make you happy
I don't think you ever could be happy

Maybe you should try some therapy
Maybe you should lose a couple of homeboys, skip upon a homegrown
Look at me
Cause I need you to understand

Now when you think of late nights
And me there, in your bed,
True, ride or die that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you

And when you think of my body on yours
Don't forget, once I would have died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
But that was then
But that was then

You don't know shit, you know
You act this big man and
You think you are in control
But you don't know shit, you know

I stood by your side
And pulled you away from your fire
Again and again and again
I should have known fire would win

Maybe you should try some therapy
Maybe you should lose a couple of homeboys, skip upon a homegrown
Look at me
Cause I need you to understand

Now when you think of late nights
And me there, in your bed,
True ride or die that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you

And when you think of my body on yours
Don't forget, once I would have died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
But that was then
But that was then

[2x]
You gonna miss me
You really gonna miss me
You gonna miss me
You gonna miss me
You gonna miss me
You really gonna miss me

Now when you think of late nights
And me there, in your bed,
True, ride or die that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you

And when you think of my body on yours
Don't forget, once I would have died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
