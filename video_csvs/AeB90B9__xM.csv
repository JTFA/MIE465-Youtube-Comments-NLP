"Are you seriously implying that an animal would be adversely affected, or even be aware at all, if it was being watched through a camera? The Orwellian nightmare of constant surveillance can only occur to those who are firstly aware that cameras are a thing (which of course animals are not), and to those who stand to lose something, be it liberty or some sort of freedom if it were being watched, which are of course animals do not. 

If you are going to insist on doing some moral grandstanding then at the very least make some sort of logical sense.",0.3626,111
