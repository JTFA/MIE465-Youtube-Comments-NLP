Not one single human being will lose joy in their life due to joy and INNOCENCE being robbed from them.  Everything that was taken from the abuse survivors are given back ten fold by the shed  blood of Jesus Christ.  And they WILL!!!  have it!  Because Jesus did not come for nothing.  Jesus came so we could have, obtain, and experience all the free goodness that the Father in Heaven has given us.  Jesus came,  suffered,  and died,  and resurrected so that Holy Spirit could be sent to us.  Holy Spirit is the most wonderful gift of all.  Because now we have the authority and power to exercise Father God's Word.  And to use gifts of Holy Spirit to heal,  love, and comfort one another.  This is the most wonderful gift ever!  Nothing can top this gift.  Let there be peace that surpasses all understanding in the MIGHTY name of YESHUA for survivors and parents and family friends and anyone else effected by this.  The blood of Jesus covers all their situations and circumstances.   They will no more be effected by what has happened to them.

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also üíûJohn 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

"no but i know a hero when i see him... 
its very obvious that a state based on self-administered justice DON'T work...
but sometimes i think it would be not that fault to make 1. some deterrent examples and 2. you must know i'm not from america.. i guess american prison is the sentence hard enough... but im from switzerland.. 
5-10 years prison (WITH CHANCE TO GET OUT EARLIER) and in our jails are zero (no joke 0%-1%) violence cases... 
so maybe im a lil bit over sensitive (i think prison in america (dependent on state and jail self) can be hell af))

but to be real most sex offender don't learn... they maybe can't because its a illness on the end of the day... but there are some pedophiles that can hold them self back... and there are the others who are just waste of space...

but back to this case...  i absolute understand the father and hope he don't have to pay something or go to jail for that... 
he not even rly hurt him... 
(like when he used a weapon, knife or something toxic... than the case would change...)
but WHAT I SAW HERE is a hero who protect something that is important for him..
