"Comparing the costs of photovoltaic roads to just regular asphalt is really strange. It's not like they're trying to just make an asphalt road.... The correct comparison should be to combined costs of regular solar panels and an asphalt road. In which case the separate elements are still way cheaper. Soon, once the so called inventors have received their fat funding, someone with an actual brain will suggest to just build asphalt roads with a couple of solar plants wherever they need them, which will be a tenfold cheaper. (Which is what China has been doing for years now: Building massive solar plants, while the West sits on their ass and waits for the oil to run out before getting into action).",-0.7719,135

"Did a little bit of research. Apparently you can get your driveway paved for $2 to $5 USD per square _foot_, but I thought even that seemed too cheap for an actual roadway (what with all the other structures necessary for a road that aren't so for a driveway), so I used the first numbers I could find, which are here:
https://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/Planning/ProgramManagement/MajorPrograms/Documents/FunctionalClassificationProcedures.pdf
https://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/Finance/GASB%2034%20Documents/PavingCostpermile.pdf

The latter is a good decade and a half out of date, but I figured it's close enough. I used the minor collector specifications to estimate a 12ft lane width. The other link estimates $120,000 per mile of two lane road (however, it doesn't specify the width). 
Anyway, I ended up with about $10 per square meter.

Funny part being, that's cheaper than getting your driveway done, if you're paying five bucks per square foot.",0.8271,161
