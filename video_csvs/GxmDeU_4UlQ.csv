I have always walked like that, I thought it was normal. I know nearly everyone swings both arms but I assumed some people wouldn't.

I just don't swing my right arm. I can if I actively think about it. I don't think there was anything that caused it, and I believe I have always walked like this.
This ""habit"" (I'll call it that) comes in handy when I am walking with a fizzy bottle drink.
