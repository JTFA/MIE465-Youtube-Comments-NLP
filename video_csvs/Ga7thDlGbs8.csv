Yes, banning guns in general is going to inevitably be the future but only years after guns are banned to the general public, just so the left over guns are taken first.  You can't trust cops nor the military with guns also, this is true.  Humans are emotional and you can't trust a cop to make a split second decision weather to shoot someone or not.  This is proven fact by police killings to minorities, they're more likely to draw their firearm when confronting minorities, and their split second decision is to shoot then find other means to resolve.  As for the military, they have done more harm then good.  All we are doing is arming more and more people, not just here in the US but all over the world.",-0.9689,181

Hello good morning the Las Vegas massacre was months ago many of the survivors also lived thru the Thomas fire. This illegitimate president is doing a lot of damage to this country. President Donald j trump has celebrated his 1st year in office on January 20.th 2018 with a fundraiser  collected and planning to keep every penny of it : $200.000.000 hundred million dollar. As a tax payer I would like to know who attended the party? How many members of the nra or perhaps the CEO of the nra sipping champagne eating caviar at maralago less than 4 weeks before the massacre in Florida. This pathetic president is talking with teenagers to get an idea how to be a president because unfortunately not every school can be protected by the secret service like the school president trump children's attend.
