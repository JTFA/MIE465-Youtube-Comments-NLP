"+lammie001 The reason IW & Mia are relevent is because if he happens to hurt his back or something and misses those two M1000's, he would put himself in a potential crunch for points. Roger's schedule is light as is so he really can't afford to flush 2000 points down the drain. I guess he could make some up by playing both M1000's on the USO swing but I don't think he wants to play that much before the USO. The clay season would be the most sensible time to make it up. Unless something like that happens, he's not playing on clay this year.",0.6908,118
"+quest 123 This isn't so mysterious. Anybody who understands tennis on more than a casual fan level understands what's happening here. The truth is Roger was a victim of his own talent. If Roger wasn't so talented he wouldn't have been able to continue using the 90"" Pro Staff (same racquet Sampras and Courier used) through 2013. Nobody else in pro tennis had been using a racquet head that small since the early 2000's. Basically, Roger sabatoged himself. Once he finally upgraded to a bigger head in 2014, he was instantly a better player. Tactically, all his matchups changed because his BH doesn't break down, his return is better, his second serve is better, and he's better at net. Djokovic is the only player who beat Roger on a regular basis since the switch. Roger simply improved a few things from 14-17 which makes sense considering how long it takes to be completely acclimated to a new racquet. It's not like he wasn't close in 14 & 15. He made 3 slam finals. 

You have to understand there is no logical incentive for the top guys to risk their legacy by failing a drug test. Their legacies are already set. They would be risking that and tens of millions of dollars they are poised to make after they retire. The risk-reward equation makes no sense.",0.8143,253

"A lot to be said for experience, maturity and wisdom. A lot of people instantly assume being 36 is a handicap and a disadvantage. But because of his fitness he uses his knowledge and evolution to his advantage.

A lot of people commentating on his poor display ms here and there and easy draw but to be fair only really good players force you to up your game and when you’re as good as Federer you play as good as you need to with the guy in front of you. People assume he wouldn’t have beaten Rafa because Rafa looked so good and explosive. Well that’s Rafas game. He’s all grunt and machismo and muscles and brute force and chasing everything down but Roger has sussed him out now and realises through evolving and learning and changing that he can do things differently hence beating him 5 times in a row.

"ABSOLUTE DISGRACE THE AMOUNT OF BIAS A.O OFFICIALS AND ORGANIZERS HAVE TOWARDS FEDERER.!!!! 

The extreme heat rule comes into effect on the final match of the tournament, when the crowd favorite and media draw card (Roger Federer) is playing in a final???? Yet when other players battled through the oppressive heat during day time matches and one, (Simona Halep) ended being hospitalized after a night time match in which the roof was open, the roof gets closed????? 

Earlier this week when Rafael Nadal suggested that Roger Federer’s Australian Open schedule of night games was unfair on the rest of the competition I was kind of skeptical as I try and give others the benefit of the doubt instead of making hastily conclusions and judgments. But after last night I am now 100% convinced that Nadal was right. 

This isn't sour grapes. I have no grudge against Federer or any other player for that matter, instead I am addressing the blatant inconsistency and bias. It is glaring obvious for anyone who has eyes to see and ears to hear.

He is saving his body by not playing all tournaments and has played more aggressively so rallies don't drag out. Change of coach may have freshened him up too.

He's won 16 of his Slams after Rafa won his first, so it's not like he spent a bunch of time winning without another guy challenging him.

Your blatant fanboyism is impeding your critical reasoning, buddy. 

No one is claiming that Federer couldn't have won outdoors. However, playing indoors favours Federer. This is well known. Federer is to indoor hard courts what Nadal is to clay. That the indoor conditions favoured and that he could also have won outdoors are not two mutually exclusive thoughts. Both can be true!

Some have higher ups and lower downs. That's why mental training is equally important.

It is ridiculous to say that a sport is rigged. You think Marin doesn't want to win a 2nd GS? The players at the highest level of their sport train super hard. They don't do it for the money, they do it because they want to be the best at the sport that they love. Winning a GS is worth more to them than anything else anyone can offer.

After such an incredible achievement, you don't ask the athlete that early in the press conference, about another athlete achievement (regarless the gender). That's the only thing I stated. Then you came and said that my comment was pretty much classless towards women, when Federer answered in a gentleman manner. What I'm saying is: it was classless from the journalist, and indeed, Federer answered with class, as he should, and as he would. That's it. With that said, if press conference are organized as you described, and journalists are taking a pre-determined turn to ask questions, that would explain.

It seems to me that you backed the wrong horse, and are bitter about it. It’s a sport. As a fan it’s best to show some sportsmanship. It’s a shame that in the emotion of the day that Cilic started to proclaim that he had never been asked about whether he wanted the roof closed. Sadly, he had no say in that choice, nor did Roger. The AO rules dictate the temperate and conditions under which play is either postponed or suspended, or a roof close. The temperature on match day mandated that the roof be closed. I believe that Maron Cilic later recognized his error, or recovered his composure enough to regain a more sportsman like demeanor. No one could blame him if he lashed out in great disappointment. But he could be blamed for poor sportsmanship if he had not cooled down and back off that erroneous assertion.",-0.9315,215

Nadal had so many big chances to win a double grandslam. Everytime something else came between. Last year nadal was leading 3-1 in the fifth set and was on his way to win the title. Then Federer did sneaky by taking a medical timeout in order to distract Nadal and break the rythm. In 2012 he was leading a break in the final set against djokovic and lost and in 2014 he was the favourite against wawrinka and lost because of a back injury and now he reitred against cilic. If everything would have gone his way he would have been on 19 grandslam titles. Nadal will come back and win in Paris then hopfully he will be n good shape on London to narrow the gap to 2.

I said it came early in the press conference, too early imo. Exactly at 1m38s in the press conference. That's all I said. You don't ask a question about another athlete performance, when you just yourself accomplished something so incredible as Roger's performance. I never said it was wrong all together to ask a question about women's tournament, even if I don't think it's the time at all in that context, when I think about it.
Then below my original comment, the girl made it a gender issue. Stating it was a classless comment, compared to Roger's answer. Which is shifting the conversation entirely, as you just did as well. The problem being talking about other athletes performance that early in a press conference, not talking about women's performance in general in a man's press conference. You two ladies entirely created this discussion, and took this opportunity to 1. emphasizing a misogynistic comment that doesn't exist; 2. tell us to relax (I guess ""you're all so pressed"" is what it means).
And I love this last point. I'd even say: typical. You come here, make some things up, and then tell ""us"" to relax, we're offended so easily etc when we just casually pointed something out. Please re-read this long message and notice the progression of the conversation.

The 3rd Roger’s 1st serve was going in more consistently yet during the 4th it completely deserted him & Cilic took advantage as Federer tensed up even more. In the 5th Roger managed to get his 1st serves working again which made a huge difference to his game, Cilic played incredibly well during the match, served big but Roger is one of the few that can return his serve & that mattered as it put pressure on Cilic.

The facts are clear- Federer reached many FO finals; Nadal did NOT reach many fast court finals, distorting the H2H.
King of Clay is a great accomplishment...but Nadal's hard movement, patchy serving, modest variety matters. He has little hope of playing top tennis at 36 nor winning 20 slams.",-0.743,132

If I was advising him I would suggest he play the french but not really push the boat out, play hard but not at a level where he'd risk getting an injury.

"mizofan Yes, like i said, its a dream^^. But i can see him win one more major this year. Lets enjoy this 2018 season! Because i have the feeling that the 2018 season is the last in that the players of ""the old era"" really can dominate. After that other players will have great succes and slowly replace them. But i want to have murray, djokovic, nadal, federer, delpo and wawrinka at the top for a last time. How epic would that be? Imagine a world tour final with these 6 and probably cilic and dimitrov:)",0.9546,114

"sorry guys but I kind of agree with quest123, hear me out before jumping to conclusions. I am a Fed fan and am super happy he won his 20th GS. I know he has been pushing for players to be honest about drug testing but there are ways in which you can ""bend the rules"" so to say, we have seen it in another sports. I am not accusing anyone of anything but I just think that after 2012, although very good, he didn't ""kill"" his opponents and he did seem to be one of those really really good players who would still be at the top of the game if they didn't succumb to the natural ageing of the body ...then after 6 months resting period he dismantles his rivals like they are amateurs winning 2 GS (1 without dropping a set for the entire tournament!) and multiple trophies (beating his biggest rival every time with ease)...and that after the natural slump every 30+ player goes through?! I mean, I'm sorry but I do find it a little bit odd, don't you? He says it's because he is playing freely but there are lots and lots of guys out there playing freely too, who have super high food regime and do lots of training, practice etc to be the very best, yet he crushes them with 6-1 6-2 or 6-0...and at 36 years of age when everyone is saying that today's tennis is the most physically gruesome?! Again, don't get me wrong, I am super happy RF got no.20 (and wish him to win Wimbly again!) but I do find it a bit odd how after a while of what seemed to be a natural slump of form (as with many 30+ players), he suddenly wins with such effortlessness. I mean even today's match, idk about you but I kind of thought Fed could easily win in 3, but decided to play for 5 sets to make it more interesting, and don't you say it's rubbish, you saw how after what seemed to be a bizarre 4th set, Fed just wiped the floor with Cilic winning it 6-1. Again I am not accusing Fed of doping, but I think he is clearly doing something more than the rest of his peers that has nothing to do with how well you train, what you eat or how talented you are. Now as I suspect what would happen is I will get lots and lots of downvotes and lots of replied back stating how wrong I am and calling me hateful and spiteful and probably a whole lot of other things...just for giving a bit of a different opinion than the masses atm.
