"Greeks are such warm hearted people that they even make the diminutive of God!!

They sometimes call him as "" Theouli mou"" ( my dear little God ). They do it with Jesus and Maria too: Christouli mou, Panayitsa mou...It is so nice. In some religions that I won't mention here, you would burn in hell forever for speaking like that :- (

There is a very famous traditional Greek song, the lyrics of which almost all Greeks know by heart.  There you have this man who asks from little God for some more marijuana! He says: 

"" Throw some pot
my dear little God
On my shisa's top"" 

The song is called ""ŒòŒµŒ≠ ŒºŒøœÖ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒøŒ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒµ"", just copy paste and listen!

2. And in Spanish, you can even make the diminutive of the most tragic human condition: I mean the fact that no matter what, we will always be alone. But instead of saying I am solo, you can say "" I am solito"" and it already sounds less heart breaking. 

3. One thing I love and miss a lot about Turkey is that here, you can even talk to strangers like that! Lets say you saw and old man trying to carry heavy bags. You could call him "" Dedecigim"" which means, "" my dear little grandpa"". So it would be perfectly normal to say: 

"" My dear little grandpa, can I help you ? ""

4. Diminutives sound very warm and tender even in German. There is a truly terrifying song by Brahms called Schwesterlein ( little sister ). And it gets to me every time I listen because of this. .. It is a conversation between a little girl and her brother. She is about to die and what you will hear are her very last words. 

"" Br√ºderlein, es wird fein
unterm Rasen sein"". 

( Little brother, it will be nice
to lie beneath the grass. )

Just search for: Schwesterlein, Brahms, 16 Deutsche Volkslieder

Czech language also has a diminutive of many adjectives, some adverbs, and even a few verbs.

"You forgot one. Russian has a great abundance of diminutives, some of which are affixed to a given name. Anybody who has ever read any of the great Russian 19th century authors will agree, that the system of diminutives of names are both varied and complex. In Tolstoy's masterpiece ""War and Peace"" we are introduced to an immense gallery of character's, many of them called by a plethora of different names, each carrying an underlying message. A man with the name  –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä (Aleksandr) is normally called –°–∞—à–∞ (Sasha) by his friends, but may be called ""–°–∞—à–µ–Ω—å–∫–∞"" by his mother to denote a more loving and caring attitude towards her son. His wife might call him something third, and among his closest friends he is known as something else entirely. Some names have 10 or more diminutives, and they are used in so many different ways that it usually becomes hard for a foreigner to construe meaning out of each one, but which are totally and completely clear to a native Russian-speaker.",0.9827,194
