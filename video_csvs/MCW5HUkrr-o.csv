On another note... the Muzo is like some company laughing at us with their ""muse"" of bs.  Wonder what their salary and benefits are from the percentage of funding acquired?

I know laser speakers aren't disclosed anywhere though the microphones are.  Makes me think like the globe versions of laser yard displays can be made... I guess with speakers and/or transducers also... to beam in all directions inverse phase signals related to the perimeter microphones or antennas if inverting RF and not only the pressure waves. 

Amazing!  Though humorous seeing the crap and at least something, coming to market other than having to invest in the Jem system apparel and/or Anechoic Chamber wall insulation along with an EW ECM perimeter to countermeasure what comes into the perimeter of the yard and perimeter antenna farm as well as well... pun intended... water well lines and other incoming lines.

"Even the setup you used to demonstrate active sound cancellation is the best case scenario as if you are trying to cancel out external noise, you would first have to detect it using a microphone, process it so that it ignores the desirable signal produced by the speakers(which will cause a infinite loop of emitting and detecting signals) , amplify it and then output it. Even if you circuit is extremely fast, it will still have a phase difference which will cause superposition of the noise and cancelling signal causing formation of nodes and antinodes.
So you will end up with some places with near silence and some with even more noise than before.
That is why active noise cancellation works only on small apparatuses and that too when paired with passive noise cancellation.",0.8194,144

The only thing I ask you to try is in the ""privacy"" mode (just to avoid any trial)... in their idea privacy mode seems to invert the working mode: It should cancel what is on the same side of the muzo  respect the vibrating surface (of course this means that the only people could not hear you should be under the table but that's another story.. :D). Could you do again the test with the glass window leaving the camera outside and stay inside with muzo on the internal side of the window? try to speak and let's see if the camera can hear you through the ""muzo vibrating barrier"". It is the simpliest way as the sound it should cancel is near to it and the result is on the other side of the ""vibrating"" surface. If you stay on the wrong side the sound emitted will be in phase respect the emitted but sound cancelling requires the counterphase.. could you try? I am curious. Thanx a lot!",0.2505,226

"It shouldn't be too hard to demonstrate possible noise cancellation, based on ""reversed vibrations"" (or is it ?)
Common use of a vibrating tuning fork is to place it against a hollow guitar body or placed against your skull bone (just next to your ear lobe).
An easy-to-get tuning fork is in the note of ""A"" @ 440 hz.
...where it is placed on top of a thin table-top or window (like the suggested Muzo placement(s))
An audible sensor (contact mic) could detect the vibrations of the surface, then flip the signal 180 deg....theoretically canceling the vibration movement if an equal vibration is applied with a speaker or ""actuator"".
But I don't think an analog sensor is able to catch-up with the actual (re)verberations, in real time. A digital sampling of the constant vibrations might help, and help predict only a steady tone/vibration.

"Open active noise suppression is for the most part useless and all attempts thus far are just 'Kick starter' sales hype. Our ears will always hear the unwanted noise long before any electronic system can effectively cancel it out in any open environment. Active digital 'noise' processing however, is only effective with 'cans' or well designed non-ported bud-style headphones that block most of the unwanted sounds. Only when the ambient (unwanted) noise is first adequately isolated from both ears, can that ambient noise can be 'cancelled out' completely, by active 'noise' suppression. Quality products actively sample the ambient 'noise' in real-time with a built-in microphone, injecting a signal known as 'anti-noise' that effectively cancels 'noise' from combining with the desired source that reaches your ears. I'd like to note however that with my active noise cancelling headphones, they best filtered regular rhythmic noises allot easier than irregular loud noises.

"There are only two ways of reducing noise. Either you reverse cancel it as close to the source as possible but you will probably only be able to effectively reduce noise in one direction. Or you reverse cancel it as close to the receiver/ear as possible. Those are the only two ways to get decent results, and even then it is a hard thing to achieve. A device like the Muzo that actually works, would for any sound engineer (like myself) be the proverbial holy grail of technology. The implications of the Muzo technology actually working would not only mean that we would be able to cancel noise, but enhance the sound of live concerts and speaker systems enormously. Not to mention what it would do for the science community. So you can all be sure that when and if this technology ever sees the light of day it will not start out as a small device that randomly enters the market being sold primarily to private persons. It would probably start out as an enormously expensive machine that only some high profile physics laboratories could afford and use. After a couple of generations it would be less expensive and trickle out to the Pro Audio industry. And lastly after many years there would be a version that might work for the private market.
