If he took it off shouldn't it have gone back with him and since it didn't how powerful is his backpack really? at one point in the movie they come across a scene needing bolt cutters and he reaches in and pulls out exactly what he needs a lot like dead pools bag, so again I ask how powerful is this jumanji bag and is there a reason it didn't disappear with the character.",-0.2259,125

"(The Carnal/Unspiritual man cannot understand the bible because they don't have the author living inside of them, The Holy Spirit!):
But the natural man
does not receive
the things of the Spirit of God,
for they are foolishness to him;
nor can he know them,
because they are
spiritually discerned.
(1 Corinthians 2:14).
***(Hebrews 1:9)<--Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the (oil of gladness) above thy fellows.
***(Acts 5:32)<---And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the (Holy Ghost), whom God hath (given to them) that (obey him).
***(Matthew 25:3-4)<--(Wise and Foolish Virgins)<--They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

(Immorality Defiles the Church (3):
Your glorying is not good.
Do you not know that 
a little leaven 
leavens the whole lump?
Therefore
purge out the old leaven, 
that you may be a new lump, 
since you truly are unleavened.
For indeed Christ, 
our Passover, 
was sacrificed for us.
Therefore let us keep the feast,
not with old leaven, 
nor with the leaven of malice 
and wickedness,
but with the unleavened bread
of sincerity and truth.
(1 Corinthians 5:6-8).
***The backdrop for this passage is the Passover, when the Israelite's removed yeast from their homes in preparation for the feast. The removal of leaven was a reminder of the Israelite's quick departure from Egypt. They did not have time to wait for leavened bread to rise.
***The point here is that a little leaven has tremendous impact or influence on whatever it is in.
***The Corinthian church was tolerating sexual sin. This leaven of sin, though small in size, was dangerous, because it could spread through the church.
***Like cancer, sin demands drastic surgery.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
(Immorality Must be judged):
But now I have written to you
not to keep company
with anyone named a brother,
who is sexually immoral,
or covetous,
or an idolater,
or a reviler,
or a drunkard,
or an extortioner—
not even to eat with such a person.
(1 Corinthians 5:11).
***(Not even to eat with such a person): Eating together is a key part of fellowship and closeness with others.
***The Corinthians were not to have fellowship with those who claimed to be Christians but whose lives were dominated by SIN!
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Immorality Must be judged) (Cont):
For what have I to do with
judging those also who are outside?
Do you not judge those
who are inside?
But those who are outside
God judges.
Therefore
“put away from yourselves
the evil person.”
(1 Corinthians 5:12-13).
***(Do you not judge...God Judges): The church's responsibility is to discipline its members while trusting the Lord to judge the world.
***(Matthew 13:30)<---Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
***Paul explains that he was not speaking of the pagan culture around them. If they withdrew totally they would be unable to function in the world. Instead, he was talking about the immorality in their midst.
***They should judge the sin among themselves, while still reaching out to the lost in Corinth.",-0.9928,724

You dropped the ball on the Plane/Curvature of the Earth question.

"With regard to planes and the curvature of the Earth, I've seen several answers that get a part of the answer right, but I thought it might be nice to have the full answer:
Airplane pilots do not need to adjust their altitude on long flights for two reasons: First, they're acted on by gravity, which pulls them towards the center of the earth, so they naturally follow the planet's curvature. Second, they're acted on by lift, which is acting on the atmosphere they're flying through, which is also curved, so again (within limits of atmospheric density) their plane will follow the curvature of the earth.
ghostinthebox mentioned great circle routes, which are an important factor in long-distance air travel. It is technically feasible to fly in a straight line between two distant points, but because of the curvature of the earth, that isn't actually the shortest distance. It's a shorter distance to follow a curved path that follows the curvature of the earth's surface. Modern ships and aircraft use great circle routes, which require constantly turning the vehicle to stay on course (See https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/multimedia-asset/great-circle-route)",0.9664,209

"You dropped the ball on the Plane/Curvature of the Earth question. 

The answer is simply… no, unless you are traveling at escape velocity speeds. 

Because anything slower than that, the gravity will continue to pull you down as the earth curves under you. And you won’t notice any change. 

If you were traveling at escape velocity speeds but didn’t want to escape the earth’s gravity well… then you would need to constantly adjust your nose down to avoid flying out into space. But that would require flying much faster than the fastest plane ever flown.",-0.0516,113

"okay The Last Jedi answer about instant communication was entirely disappointing.  so the interesting thing to consider is that people are able to communicate with one another no matter what distance.  the technology that's required to do this may be different but essentially because of the fact that human beings understand a common set of information.  this gets around the information Paradox is commonly attributed with entangled communication.  that is you need somebody who knows what they're seeing on the other side of an entangled Communication in order to have instantaneous communication.  people actually accomplish this every single day that they talk to another human being.  granted our information isn't moving at the speed of light but we can only choose singular words along with a set of Body Action, tone and tempo.  so imagining how that might be possible using a spooky action at a distance like the force.  one imagines that all one would need to do is figure out a way to relay thoughts to another person's brain.  given that Star Wars is much more technologically advanced they might have Technologies which are essentially like grains of sand that link together two people at a distance.  such linkage would essentially mean that the person is able to talk to you directly through your brain.  in other words by triggering the somatosensory cortex you can make a person feel things if you trigger the occipital cortex you can make them see things and so on and so forth.  this sort of electrical stimulation of 1 senses is essentially the very fine control of an electrical signal.  we know that it's possible to produce such a micro electrical waves that have a very complex waveform.  this is essentially what is happening inside a person's head.  so the ability to transmit Electro mechanical waves through time and space using entangle object could result in people being able to have instantaneous communication at FTL speeds.",0.9296,341
