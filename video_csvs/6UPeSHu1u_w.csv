"There's no solid proof saying pre-columbian people and their ancestors are from Africa, as a matter of fact the idea that Mayans and Aztecs are descendants from Africa is rather pathetic. Is it really hard to believe that maybe, there was an indigenous race separate from whites, blacks, Indian or Asian that developed to such an extent without help from Africans??? By your logic whites are African, Chinese are African, the whole world is African. But sadly the barring straight theory is just that. A theory. Have some pride in your people without sucking credit and giving credit to another race or nation. Oh and the head augmentations...
