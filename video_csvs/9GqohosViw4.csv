It's the only package delivery service that is public in the U.S. (so, that we _technically_ have a right and not privilege to use, albeit it is partially funded through private entities), and they hire a lot of vets and disabled folk, which benefits the general welfare.

Also, mail innovation means your package will get to you better if it's coming through USPS, so who can argue with that? üòÇ",0.5149,92
