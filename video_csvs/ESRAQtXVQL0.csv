Cankerous Booch dumbass technocratic nerd.,-0.7003,6
Cankerous Booch rubbish and nothing but bias hiding behind the faulty theory of population growth and its relation to the supply of goods and services. One has nothing to do with the other despite these weak ass economic hypothesis. America leads the pack in economic inequality and their waste of goods far exceeds any demands. Kick rocks.,0.7514,61

"I hope the mother was either helped out with a job too or found one on her own or even if the property in city owned and rent free she won't be able to pay the overheads and maintain their new home for long. It is shocking to see by the way how in the number one economy of the world with some of the highest GDP/capita rate, there are entire homeless families living under 3rd world conditions.",0.5267,83

Twilight Zone was wondering the same thing but I heard from someone who saw the whole story that the mother is currently in nursing school and also works. So she's probably on income based rent until she finishes school and go into her field.,0.0,46

"stevo9er inequality is inherent with nature. Yours is a noble endeavour, though I feel mitigating selection without true understanding of the exponential increase in demand for resources and how to fix that is naive. Google malthusianism, third World birth rates AFTER western aid and intervention and the genii coefficient, too. If you go and study these and come back we can continue.",0.0946,70
