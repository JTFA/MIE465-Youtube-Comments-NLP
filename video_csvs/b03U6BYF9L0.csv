"+Eva - you stated you are learning................so I gave you relevant information to point you in the right direction.  So which is it??  Are you interesting in learning - or are you interested in learning only that which supports your pre-existing biases??  If it is the latter:   we call that ""confirmation bias"".  Confirmation bias leads to deductive fallacies by the way.  

Moral of the story:  anti-vaxxers love to make claims and throw around terms like ""viral shedding"" etc. so as to rationalize their ideology.  Yet as alluded to - unless they understand the ""context"" of what they are claiming = they often reach incorrect conclusions because they are not looking at the totality of what is being discussed.  To learn - one must first be amenable to *ALL* information - after which false conclusions can be discarded upon the assessment of relative evidence.  ""Context"" is always critical to understanding.",0.89,176
"+I'm - ""Like they said, the original paper was disproven 25 times"" = original anti-vaxxer claim dating to the 1980's.  It was as you noted debunked decades ago.  The entire anti-vaccine movement = one of constantly shifting ""causative agents"" so as to keep the ideology alive as some profit from it.  Follow the white rabbit Neo:

1 -1980's-early 90's = vaccine caused by intestinal damage leading to developmental delays.
2 - mid-1990's = anti-vaxxer pivot to attacking Thimerosal.
3 - early 2000's = multiple studies demonstrate Thimerosal does not cause autism -------> anti-vaxxers pivot again to attacking the ""ingredients"" of vaccines ---------> attacking the number of vaccines ----------> attacking the schedule that vaccines are administered in ------------> attacking vaccines long-term impact..............and round and round the hamster wheel goes.  

Moral of the story:  as we see the anti-vaccine movement is nothing more than an ideology of constantly shifting points of attack as each claim is systematically debunked by credible studies.  We are left with a movement which is profitable for some - but one that lacks a credible evidentiary basis to support it's assertions...........leaving it nothing but emotionally-based rhetoric and hyperbole + conspiracy theories spread via the internet.",-0.6486,232

"If anti-vaccination people want to experience the diseases that the vaccinations prevent, we should make them.",0.1027,18
"If anyone is interested to know; A vaccine is a weakened form of the virus injected into the bloodstream usually by a hypodermic needle given by a licensed medical professional, most commonly a nurse. With the weakened virus inside of the body, the immune system can learn what to look for and fight when the real virus attacks, keeping your body safe from that strain of virus. 
Because of vaccines, places that can vaccinate have pretty much gotten rid of most deadly diseases, such as measles, chickenpox, smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, mumps, some strains of influenza, rabies, polio, and rubella, among other diseases.  Before vaccines were invented, mortality rates for such diseases were very high, meaning there was a high chance of dying from the disease if not given proper treatment. 
While there are different strains of some viruses, such as influenza, the flu vaccine given during each flu season is a weakened form of the strain that had the highest prevalence of that season, meaning you're less likely to catch the flu. However there is still a chance that you may catch a different strain of influenza that doesn't have a vaccine during that season, but with proper rest, care, and medication, the flu is usually gone in about a week or two. 
While vaccines are important for your health, there are some people who have compromised immune systems or are too young to get vaccinated. This is where herd immunity is important. If enough people in the community are vaccinated against a disease, that protects not only those with a healthy immune system, but also those who are more vulnerable to disease. And if you're wondering about vaccine fatalities, the Center for Disease Control reported that in 2015, there were less than 6000 deaths related to vaccine injury and 1.6 people per a population of 100,000 in 2015. 
Unfortunately the CDC does also report that this year's vaccination doesn't seem to fight well against the dominant strain of this season, H3N2. The vaccine has been reported to only be 10-25% effective.  
""There are a couple of reasons why it’s harder to vaccinate against H3N2. For one, the virus mutates as it moves through the population at a faster rate than other flu viruses — making it even harder to design a shot that matches the circulating virus.
""One other reason the flu vaccine tends to underperform in H3N2 years has to do with ... eggs. To produce the vaccines, manufacturers need to grow a lot of flu virus — and they discovered long ago that flu virus grows extremely effectively in eggs. So viruses are injected into fertilized hen’s eggs, incubated for several days while they replicate, then harvested from the eggs, killed (or inactivated), and purified to go into vaccines.
""But lately, researchers have found that there are problems with the egg-based approach that specifically relate to H3N2.
In the process of adapting virus to grow in eggs, that seems to introduce further changes to the [H3N2] virus, which may impair the effectiveness of the vaccine. In other words, while growing the flu virus for vaccines, H3N2 mutates to adapt to the eggs, which seems to result in a vaccine mismatch."" 
So as we can see, the reason for the ineffectiveness of this year's vaccines is due to a strain of influenza that is adaptable to what we use to try to defeat it. 
Now if you are still wondering, no, vaccines do not cause autism, nor would it be the end of the world if they do. Vaccines are for your immune system, whereas autism primarily affects your neurology, meaning rarely, if ever, do the two correlate with one another. 
Now I don't know if that makes any difference to you, but I can assure you that autism is much, much better than any of those diseases. If you were infected with polio before the vaccine was invented, you wouldn't be able to breathe on your own for the rest of your life. You would be permanently confined to an iron lung, that is, if the polio didn't kill you first. I really don't want to see any children in iron lungs or infected with measles. It's not something anyone should go through, let alone an innocent child. If we don't vaccinate children, we could be seeing more of them in iron lungs instead of smiling and laughing or playing outside or dressing up as princesses and princes. Why should a six year old have to suffer the repercussions of such terrible diseases, like polio, that they could never go outside or ride a roller coaster or go sledding ever again? We need to take care of them. They're the next generation.",-0.9633,892

Moral of the story:  blaming a vaccine for a bad reaction is like claiming peanut butter is dangerous because you find are allergic to it.  Vaccines (and peanut butter) are what they are.  The issue lay not with them but with your inability to tolerate something that so many others have no problem with.  You are ""projecting"".",-0.876,129

"Keep in mind that all of the credible science supports vaccination.  If you look objectively at anti-vaxxer claims you will note that they typically involve:

1 - debunked claims and retracted studies.
2 - gross misrepresentation of legitimate studies so as to form conclusions which the evidence does not support = ""confirmation bias"" - which means they are only seeing the parts they believe support their pre-existing biases while ignoring other evidence which does not.
3 - heavy extrapolation of evidence.  As an example.  In the 1990's when the anti-vaxxers began to attack Thimerosal - they pointed to studies which claimed it was bad.  Those ""studies"" however were laboratory studies where they ""extrapolated"" results as noted to apply to people.  Yet when multiple large-scale studies were conducted around the world to test the claim using tens of thousands of real children = the alleged link between autism and Thimerosal did not manifest.  
4 - conspiracy theories which seem to be the soup du jour of anti-vaxxer claims.  Never forget that conspiracy theories = admitting that you have no evidence - thus you are reduced to concocting conspiracies to rationalize what you can not otherwise demonstrate.
5 = emotionally-based rhetoric and hyperbole.  A lot of anti-vaxxer claims appeal to emotion at the expense of logic. 

Moral of the story:  it's good that you think for yourself and question what you are told.  Now add to that researching those questions by seeking *CREDIBLE* research.  Keep in mind however there is a *LOT* of misinformation and click-bait in the internet.

The vaccine was created based upon studies which showed that the majority of people who live in areas where Dengue Fever is endemic will by the time they are 12 years old have been exposed to the fever at least once in their lives.  The vaccine was developed for use on just such people = >9 years old and who have previously been exposed to Dengue.  So we instead see the government giving the vaccine to children under 9 years old + children who had never before been exposed to the virus = adverse results because the vaccine was employed outside it's intended parameters.

"conan263 

Yeah no. A few Facebook moms doesn’t make it a movement. Taken from the NHS website - “No conclusive evidence has been found linking pollution or maternal infections in pregnancy with an increased risk of ASD.” 

And let’s look at the show.

In 2002, Finegold and colleagues published an analysis of stool (poo) samples from 11 autistic children (presumably these are the same children tested in the Sadler et al study but that’s not entirely clear). Their main finding was an increased level of clostridia in the samples, compared to non-autistic children. According to The Autism Enigma, “several researchers have replicated [this] finding”. However, I could only find one independent replication - a 2006 study by Parracho et al. 

Other studies haven’t replicated the findings. In a more recent paper, Finegold et al 2010 reported that clostridia actually accounted for significantly less of the gut bacteria in severely autistic kids, compared with non-autistic control children. Instead, they found an increase in Desulfovibrio bacteria. Finegold now argues that this is a more fruitful line of enquiry. In fact, there was a point in The Autism Enigma when Finegold, discussing the impact of antibiotics said “…the organisms that tend to persist are Clostriddia…” and then the audio was cut mid-sentence. My guess is that he went on to mention other bacteria but the program-makers didn’t want to complicate their simple narrative.

I’m not in a position to comment on the technical aspects of the studies. However, even to a non-expert, an obvious limitation of these studies is that they have only 8 or 10 control children. This makes it very difficult to be sure what is “normal”, particularly given the emphasis on bacteria being found in autistic children but never in controls. One recent Australian study [PDF] took a different approach, comparing 28 autistic children to a much larger sample collected as part of other research studies. They found relatively little evidence of bacterial abnormalities - and only 1 out of the 28 children with autism had clostridium counts that were outside the normal range. Similarly, several studies have pointed to “abnormalities” of gut bacteria in the stool samples of non-autistic siblings of autistic children. This could be interpreted in many different ways, but clearly complicates any story linking bacteria to autism.

Finally, we shouldn’t confuse correlation with causation. Even if there really are abnormalities of gut bacteria in kids with autism, they could simply be a consequence of their often altered diet. As The Autism Enigma points out, many autistic kids will only eat a restricted set of foods - and many will also eat things they’re not supposed to (Andy Bolte ate ashes and paint). Some parents administer probiotics or will enforce gluten or casein free diets. In their 2002 paper, Finegold et al. acknowledge that “we are not aware of any studies that have indicated whether such a diet influences the makeup of the bowel flora” (admittedly there may be recent studies that do indicate). Similarly, Parracho et al. (2006) noted “an association between high clostridial counts and individuals consuming probiotics”. It’s difficult to know what’s cause and effect, but The Autism Enigma only considered one possibility - the bacteria came first.


Setting those concerns aside, the theory put forward in The Autism Enigma was that autism is caused by propionic acid, a common food preservative that also happens to be a bi-product of clostridia. According to the narrator, “Once in the brain it changes brain cells to become like those of autistic people”.

The program featured a study by Dr Derrick MacFabe and colleagues in which rats were administered propionic acid and immediately started behaving strangely. They became less social, ignoring one another, and also started hunching up their backs as they ran. Viewers were invited to make the connection to social aversion and toe-walking of autistic kids.

Animal research can play an important role in understanding the causes of autism, but results always need to be treated with caution. Often they don’t translate to humans - and it’s difficult to know whether atypical rat behaviour really is equivalent to atypical human behaviour. Given that autism affects so many aspects of cognition and behaviour, it’s very easy to find some aspect of experimentally-induced behaviour that could be described as “autistic-like”.

One other point of note. In the program we were simply told that the propionic acid was “given to the rats in small doses”. I’d naively assumed that the rats were given it in their water but, in fact, it was injected directly into their brains. MacFabe states that propionic acid can easily get to the brain from the gut, but we still need to know whether the amount reaching the brain via the gut is equivalent to the amount being pumped directly into the rats’ brains. As the saying goes, the dose makes the poison. Indeed, the fact that propionic acid is found in lots of food products suggests that our brains are already exposed to it at some level.

If nothing else, The Autism Enigma serves an important purpose in highlighting gastro intestinal issues that affect some individuals with autism. They’re clearly part of the bigger autism picture and might provide clues to the origins of autism in at least some cases. But even to a non-expert like me, there are legitimate concerns about the research on which The Autism Enigma relied and, in particular, the strengths of conclusions that can be drawn from those studies. The science is still at a very preliminary stage and, at best, is relevant to only a subset of the autism population. Admittedly, Kerry O’Brien, who introduced the documentary to Australian viewers, was at pains to emphasise the controversial nature of the research, but nothing he said explained why the research was controversial. The net effect was to caricature the researchers involved as maverick outsiders.

This I think is a shame. My reaction from reading the papers is that research on gut bacteria in autism is similar in many ways to what might be considered more mainstream areas of autism science. It struggles with the same complexities and many of the same criticisms apply. Over-generalization of conclusions; a tendency to confuse correlation with cause; sample sizes that are way too small; evidence that is consistent in vague descriptive way but completely contradictory when you get up close. We could be talking about psychological research, genetics, neuroimaging, behavioural intervention research. Progress is being made but these are all still developing fields of science.

The difficulty, as one father stated at the beginning of the program, is that “Parents can’t wait for science to catch up.” As The Autism Enigma showed, there are plenty of people, well-meaning or otherwise, who are prepared to fill that gap. The problem is not so much false hope as false certainty.

im not entirely against vaccinations but my personal philosophy is to not over vaccinate because the moment a child is born they inject them with multiple doses of many different vaccinations.

so the whole thing about people freaking out about their kids 'getting autism' annoys me because its now a joke.
