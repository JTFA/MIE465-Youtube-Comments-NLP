"""I believe she believes it happened though...""

That is a good way to put it. I too think it is possible that Dylan really believes in 'her truth', as she puts it. Various scenario's have been put to the fore:

1. Allen abused her.
2. Farrow deliberately planted false memories in her.
3. Farrow unintentionally contributed to creating false memories in her.
4. She is a liar who wants to hurt her abandoning father.

With regard to Dylan's conviction, these scenario's result in:

1. Dylan knows the facts.
2. Dylan believes what she calls facts, even though they are not true.
3. see 2.
4. Dylan does not believe what she says, but nevertheless maintains it.

The fact is: there is no conclusive evidence for any of these scenario's. And we, as onlookers, cannot distinguish between them. Particularly not between 1, 2 and 3. Some people 'feel' they can distinguish between 4 and the other scenario's. But personally I wouldn't be sure of that.",-0.8156,204

2) this is a girl who had a very unconventional upbringing (allegedly manipulative mother who poisoned her against her father). Check out Moses Farrow’s story (Dylan’s brother). 

3) the alleged “sexual assault” took place when Dylan was 7 years old. At that age children are still learning about life and the world. You could tell your Mom that your Dad grabbed your hand to cross the road, and she could tell you that’s called “sexual assault” and that he’s a bad person. And at 7 you’d believe her. And suddenly anything he does would seem creepy, and your memories would be distorted.

"So I assume that you accept all the other facts that I presented. Thank you.

You assert that ""they started having sex in the late 80s when she was under 20 years old"".

You are factually wrong on two counts. You have no idea at what age they started 'having sex' in the normal meaning of the word. You were not there, I was not there. It is their private life. All we know is that Mia Farrow allegedly discovered nude photo's of her in Allen's home in late 1991 or early 1992, when Soon-Yi was 21 years of age. 

You can think about that what you want, you can find it 'in bad taste' etc. For my sake, you can find a relationship between a 55 year old man and a 21 year old woman 'creepy' or 'disgusting' or whatever. 

Still this bears no relationship whatsoever to sexual abuse of 7 year old. This relationship exists only in your imagination.

What is unfortunately not 'imaginative', is the occurrence of false allegations of child abuse, particularly in cases of 'ugly divorces'. A recent Dutch study showed that 86% of such accusations were not sufficiently founded for further investigation, let alone prosecution. False allegations of sexual abuse are not rare (ask your nearest family lawyer) and are used as a weapon by 'angry' women to hurt their ex where it hurts the most: his children. Because many people (and police) tend to 'believe' the victim (because the crime is so serious), it is *very* hard for falsely accused men to 'prove' their innocence, and often their life is destroyed. The risk for the woman is small, since false allegations are rarely prosecuted; because they are similarly hard to disprove.

We can't be 100% sure whether in Farrow's case, the abuse did, or did not, happen. We can only deal rationally with possible scenario's. And the 'false allegation' scenario is far too likely to neglect.",-0.9955,390

"So eon001, I have got good news for you: Allen ""did not end up marrying his foster daughter"". So as to your own admission, now it becomes ""easier for you to argue for Allen"". What are the facts?

1. Soon-Yi was NOT Allen's adopted daughter. She was the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and André Previn.

2. Allen was NOT a 'father' to Soon-Yi, and Soon-Yi not a 'daughter' to Allen in any way. Soon-Yi's father was André Previn, and this stayed that way throughout her childhood. Soon-Yi herself found the idea that Allen was her father 'laughable'.

3. Allen was NOT married to Mia Farrow, and NEVER lived in her household to which Soon-Yi belonged.

4. Allen and Soon-Yi had LITTLE OR NO contact throughout her adolescence. It was at the instigation of Mia Farrow that, after Soon-Yi graduated from high school, she and Allen spent more time together.

5. Their romance did NOT start until Soon-Yi was an adult of 20 years of age. The couple got married when she was 26 or 27, and this has lasted as a stable and harmonious marriage until today.

You have no reason to doubt that she was treated respectfully, and no reason to talk about 'pressurizing' and 'making her break' and 'attacking the victim'. This is all your own fantasy. The New Haven investigative team has a great name to uphold, as have the other investigative teams that help to find out what has, or has not, happened during a particular case of abuse. In all of their years of offering their expertise, they were never even accused of 'defending wrongdoers' or 'defending atrocities'. Why do you need falsehoods to make a point?

Now unless you are absolutely psychic, or have more expertise in matters of sexual abuse than various teams of professionals, I think you have little rational ground to think that we all should 'believe' the abuse happened.
