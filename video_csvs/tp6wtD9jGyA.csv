Mikey, you make me miss my country so much.
Got out since 1975, but had not ever came back to visit yet, over 40 years now😣
Mikey, I say you just need to by a flat in Việt Nam and make it your vacation home.
Come back every year and stay for  3 months and go touring from the very bottom of the country to the very North (Hà Nội); then go back South to Sài Gòn again - then fly back to the US.
By the way, the Whole right side of our Vietnam is 1 super long Beach, Dude!
🤗Everyone, ENJOY VIETNAM🤗.
The US Dollar goes furthest in Việt Nam - out of All those countries in that neck of Southeast Asia.
I am very proud of our beautiful Vietnam and its DELICIOUS FOOD 🍲🤗",0.9846,158
