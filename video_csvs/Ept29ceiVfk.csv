"There has been in this city for the last few days a young African negro who claims to be a Hebrew. He is deaf and dumb and black. He came here from New Haven, and is trying to accumulate enough money to go back to Africa. If he is what he represents himself to be, and if what he claims is true, he is quite an interesting character. He carries a pad of paper with him and a pencil and answers all questions by writing them in Hebrew and Loschen Khodish. What incites the most wonder is that he writes Loschen Khodish very rapidly. It is the language of the books of Moses, and is made a special study of, spoken and written with ease only by the rabbis and highly educated Hebrews. This negro was sent to one of the rabbis of Hartford, who is perfectly satisfied that he is a Hebrew. He says that he came from a large town in Africa, where there are a tribe of about 20,000 black Hebrews who speak Loschen Khodish and are quite prosperous. He also says that his father is a rabbi in that town, and that is why his father took the trouble to teach him to write these languages, which needed an extra amount of labor on account of his being deaf and dumb. He says his people do not only write Loschen Khodish, but it is their speaking language as well. He left home a few years ago, and has seen a good deal of the world. In each town he hunts up the Jewish section, and there they give him clothes, food and money. He is now homesick, and intends to go back to Africa as soon as he gets money enough. He showed some money which they had collected for him at New Haven. What surprises him, he writes, is that no Hebrew knows of his countrymen in Africa. — Hartford Courant. 5658. Calendar. 1897-8.",0.8456,365
