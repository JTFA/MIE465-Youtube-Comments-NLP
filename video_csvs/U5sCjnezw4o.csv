"mistertexaz mistertexaz ""the media only does the bidding of the highest bidder""- somewhat right but mostly wrong. You can talk to journalists and even news anchors and most of the time they will tell you they are given the  journalistic freedom to report what they want. Of course, these news stations are private corporations, many times owned by some rich guy at the top. And what is wrong with that? It's called capitalism. If he wants to direct what his reporters talk about or report he has all the freedom to do so. The viewer then has to address the veracity of claims made by that news station, not just take them for granted. Most media wants lots of viewers though, who don't want to be suspicious that what they are hearing might be false or biased. That's why the media tries to develop a reputation for quality reporting. If they don't, then their subscribership will decrease. 

Then you said the media sucks at explaining why wars start and you also said they selectively choose what to report. The latter statement I addressed in the first paragraph. As for the former, you are completely wrong. In fact, I have read and watched segments from the media questioning why the US went to war in the middle East. So you are just plain wrong: just do a Google search on the justification of XYZ war and you will find a story from the media talking about it most likely with references at the bottom. 

Keep in mind there are so many different kinds of media. They are not all owned by one nefarious person. You need to search for a news source that you think is reliable and even then take what you hear with a grain of salt.

If you don't live in a western or democratic country then I don't know what your media is like. However, by saying all media are parasites you are wrong because that is not the case, at least in the west. Hopefully you have access to the internet where you can find many reliable sources of news.",-0.9595,388
