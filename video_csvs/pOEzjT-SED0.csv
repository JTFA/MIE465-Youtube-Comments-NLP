"Pure fire best female rapper in the  game .if nicki is queen then remy ma is the goddess of  hip hop. 
Ain't no one fucking with remy she got bars .it about time someone put barbie in her place . I think I wouldn't have suck a problem with her if she was to actually do something for hip hop with her status she could use it to help others make it .as there's a lack of female rappers and she could work with other females to make an impact. But instead she starts fights and prevents them from making it and I think it's cuz 1 she selfish. 2 she wants to remain on top  alone. 3 she fears competition so she tries to eliminate them 
And 4 she insecure about her own ability cuz she knows deep down she ain't the best lyrically.
