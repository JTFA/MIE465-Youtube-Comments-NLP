"Being bipolar myself I find it exhausting and I'm constantly doing self checks. Am I having another episode? Is this normal? Will this be a good or bad day? Why am I paranoid? Even with meds and therapy my moods go up and down. To be honest its a daily struggle.

If its not the adjusting of the meds and tag along weight gain, its the anxiety and depression that goes along with it. Relationships can suffer and without my support system I don't know where I'd be. Manic episodes for me usually end up with me cleaning until I throw my back out and still feel like I have more to do.

Sometimes I might even have a good week or even a month without an issue and tada I think I'm better and start thinking I don't need my meds. Which I suggest someone never do because you'll only end up in the same spot or worse. So to anyone who has this disorder I encourage you to take control of your mental health. Learn about your disorder. Take your meds. Keep a journal etc.",-0.8614,204

You can be Bipolar with only manic episodes instead of depression too, just most also have the depression tendencies added. Finally, its not a ""light switch"" where you go from happy to sad to angry in seconds, its like a glow stick, you're normal or happy, then something happens ( a snap in the glow stick) and your emotions ""light up"" for a long period of time, some epidoes last hours, days, months, and in severe cases, can last a year (usually depression episodes).",-0.6625,162
