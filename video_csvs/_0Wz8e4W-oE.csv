"a small advice for when deciding for a line at mall. Look at what costumers are buying. For example when you see a short line, but it looks like the people buying stuff for a week or so, and the people of the longer line buy less items for each costumer... take the long line.

Sometimes you can even see in advance when a person is in one of those ""problem with the maschinary"" moments, in this case avoid this line as well.",-0.1154,93
