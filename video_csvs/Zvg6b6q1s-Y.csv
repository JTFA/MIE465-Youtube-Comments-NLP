I have a choice either watch the Super Bowl or go to the movies with these four women. So I choose to go to the movies with these four women. I'll have a lot better fun anyway. And I mean no disrespect to any of those who are going to watch the Super Bowl Sunday. To me I feel like I really don't want to watch the Superbowl in the first place. Because of the simple fact is my football team which is Miami Dolphins ain't in the Super Bowl so why watch it. So I chose to go see this movie called The Winchester. The four women pick the movie not me. Anyway I couldn't let the women down the one is a very beautiful natural redhead. But anyway I definitely got to say I wish both teams good luck on Sunday on winning the Super Bowl.,0.9909,158
