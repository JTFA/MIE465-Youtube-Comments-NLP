I would've used in ear isolation buds for this. Assuming I could have afforded the costs for something like this. The click along with a single frequency harmony through that kind of monitor would put a player in their own audio space even that close to one another. Any mistake would be directly associated with the players ability to play in time. That's hard enough really.,0.5267,71
