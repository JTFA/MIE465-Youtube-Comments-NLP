"good video! I think you have potential to be a HUGE YouTuber and make so much money that this becomes your permanent job! It's just My spouse and i realized that your channel isn't growing very fast, which is holding you again! If your videos received some more views, they'd do so much better in the YouTube algorithm. My MAIN channel has been possessing a ton of success because I bought a $4 guide on getting an unlimited amount of views on any video. Literally, I just started and one of my videos already has almost 7, 000 views and will have 20, 000 VIEWS by the end of the week, which is giving me a BIG  boost in the YouTube search and algorithm because my subscriber count goes up 60 subscribers every day now. I understand it sounds like an ad lol but it could really explode your channel. I can't post links in comments, so you'll have to find the link to the guide in the MAIN channel banner. My main channel is featured on this channel right now that I'm using to comment. The link will be in the bottom right corner of the main channel banner. Hope this helps ya out a little down the road: )

You might have an extra 20,000 views on this video by the end of the week lol I'm serious, it helps get the ball rolling so give it a look :)",0.9853,262
