"Chris, I’ll start off by apologising that what I’m about to ask has nothing to do with this video and while it may seem silly, it’s actually a really big part for me of deciding whether I take the leap and move out to Japan... So what I’d really like to know is, how rife are the huntsman spiders and those big centipedes, especially in regards to being in your apartment? Outside I wouldn’t mind as much, it would just be coming home to find one inside my room. 

Being a massive arachnophobia, the thought of coming home to see a huge, hairy and terrifying spider that is unbelievably quick making itself comfortable in my home really puts me off moving to Japan. I’ve been told that it can get really bad in the countryside especially when there’s wet weather and it’s rare to get them in your home in the cities. Is this true? And have you had any experiences with them yourself? I’d love to know and I’m sure many others would too!

"Hi, Abroad in Japan. I enjoy every each of your videos!  Sometimes it is suspicious if I understand everything that you said, though;D
In my humble opinion, アメリカン・パイパイパイ(完結編）：俺たちの同騒会 could be a well-considered Japanese title. Because it carries me, who is a Japanese that doesn't know about ""American Pie"" movies at all, the movie should be a hilarious slapstick-ish American sex comedy over the characters' school reunion, which is the last episode of a series of movies.
It is hard to say that the ""American Pie"" movies are well known to Japanese.  ""American Pie"" as it is conveys nothing about the movie to Japanese.  
The key is パイパイパイ, I believe. As you know, pai-pai means boobs, excuse me, in Japanese slang. So, if it turns out ""American Pai-Pai"", that sounds like ""American Boobs"" to Japanese; there's no pie anymore, but that will tell people what kind of movie it would be.  Still, the promoters might think it away vulgar to put just two ""pai""s in a movie title, then twisted to add the third one to make it vague and sounds somewhat cheerful, and even to keep a hint of the original title, I just guess.

"These are certainly a special breed. Not speaking Japanese though I can't help but wonder if they contain some puns that only work in Japanese?
Either way, being German I am somewhat used to movies getting random additions to the title to ensure every damn idiot gets what the movie might be about. Some of the most random ones:
""Alien"" became ""Alien – Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt"", literally ""Alien The scary creature from a foreign world""

""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" became ""Vergiss mein nicht!"" - ""Forget me not!""

""Oceans Eleven""? Yeah, when it was released in Germany it became ""Oceans Eleven - Frankie und seine Spießgesellen"" or ""Oceans Eleven - Frankie and his henchmen""

""Escape from New York"" turned into ""Die Klapperschlange"" or ""The Rattlesnake""
Snake Plissken has a Cobra tattoo so close enough?

"" Once Upon a Time in the West"" admittedly sounds weird when translated literally. Or rather, like a crappy children's book. So the German title ""Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod"" -""Play me the tune of Death"" actually has a nice ring to it. 

The James Bond film ""Tomorrow never dies"" was translated as ""Der Morgen stirbt nie"" - ""The morning never dies""

Think it can't get much worse?
Well. Hate to break it to you but often enough English film titles get replaced by different English film titles. Wich are usually ridiculous and in fact not really easier to understand for a non native speaker.

""Taken"" became ""96 hours""
Without a second line declaring what these hours are about.

""Thor - The Dark World"" -> ""Thor - The Dark Kingdom""
Because world is such a hard word but kingdom isn't?

""Mean Girls""? Nah, ""Girls Club""

""Tomorrowland"" -> ""A world beyond""
At least us dumb Europeans won't mistake it for the Belgian festival now?

""Captain America - The Winter Soldier"" conveys way to much American patriotism apparently. So "" The Return of the First Avenger"" it is. They added the ""Captain America"" back into it later. This one is a special case considering it's predecessor was published here as ""Captain America - The First Avenger"".

""Made in Dagenham"" -> ""We want Sex""
Pretty sure that was a male only board deciding this bullshit...

And how about guessing which film was published as ""Die Ritter der Kokosnuss"" or ""The knights of the coconut"" in Germany?
.
.
.
It was ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""
That one has a nice ring to it though.


Little Bonus fact to stay on the topic of Japan:
There's a German TV series named ""Alarm für Cobra 11 - Die Autobahnpolizei"".
It is a rather trashy scripted reality/crime show about a fictional Autobahn police department. Lots of car chases, fighting, guns, explosions, you get the gist. Sounds fun except German TV shows have much smaller budgets so the actors are mediocre at best, the story is bland and the action far from what you see in Hollywood movies or American TV. For so we reason it was still sold to TV stations in 120 different countries. The way it was marketed in Japan is absolutely hilarious though.
