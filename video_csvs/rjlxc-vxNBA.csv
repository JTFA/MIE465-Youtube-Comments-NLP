"Hey I totally agree that hitting a milestone might seem bittersweet, but you're like the classic band that will keep pushing out hits, even though newer generations may not know you. But you have your ""More Wong Fu"" channel which is more special content and vloging so maybe that will take off, it'll connect with your fans more. More VLOGing, More meet and greets, More Collabs, especially with the recent talent, more Challenges and you become even more relevant to the now generations.  You can continue to have fun making your productions, but what I think what will keep you pumped is going out and experiencing the energy of old...and new fans alike! Let's get ""More Wong Fu"" to 1million in 2018!  Lastly, if you can get more international fan base, especially from Asia...your numbers will blow up! Just saying, and Good Luck guys!",0.9608,170

"I am actually GLAD that Wong Fu is not this greatest and most famous channel ever! Because usually when artists get to such an extreme height, they tend to start focusing too much on business and too little on art.

Having a huge fanbase is a good thing, but being celebrity-like famous, in my opinion, was never really that much of a good thing.

No matter what, keep being who you are Wong Fu, that's the reason why so many of us love you this much, and as the old saying goes - sometimes less is more ;)",0.4161,108

Wong Fu <3",0.893,86

Recently one of my friends became unemployed and I knew he was a big fan of you guys and Kevjumba back in the day.
""Hey...have you ever watched FunEmployed?"" I hope you guys remember that title, because I loved it back in the day.

It really was like going back to the past (ironically, this was the first video I watched from you guys, starting again.) Congrats on recently hitting 3 million. 
I know my single comment doesn't mean much, but still.",0.8477,126
"I just wanted to say that I am so happy that you guys are still going strong! I learned about Wong Fu back in ~2010 when I was still at UCSD. I love watching your videos because the content is so great! It's thoughtful, funny, with a purpose, and well-produced. Thank you for it! 
P.S. I also enjoy the occasional glimpse of UCSD in some of the videos, gives me the right dose of nostalgia :)",0.982,89
"I know most people might not remember watching their very first Youtube video, but I do, and it was Wong Fu's ""Yellow Fever"". At the time, I clicked a link a friend sent me to watch and came to this website I had never heard of, called Youtube, which was not owned by Google at the time. Quality was terrible - 320x240 resolution, 4:3 aspect, and 10 minute video time limits. On the plus side, most people got away with using copyrighted music if they chose to do so. It was really a good video, probably had like 10000+ views which was a lot back then.

Even though I barely ever watch Wong Fu anymore, if not for any other reason than being my very first watched video on Youtube, Wong Fu gives me the feels every now and again. You guys changed my life in some way, I'm sure. There is one early music video you guys made in which a guy gets hit by a car (obviously acting) while playing a song by Yellowcard that reminds me of my college days when I was younger. Doesn't feel like 12 years ago man!

I think a lot of people go through life and have moments when they feel like they wish they had done things differently. We all go through that. What is important to understand is that that time has passed, and you have only the time ahead of you to try to live life the way you want to live it with as few regrets as possible.",0.7566,290

Honestly, you guys are one of my favourite channels, if not my favourite. There's a lot of nonsense out there on youtube but I'm really glad u guys exist.

You give me motivation and inspiration after every video especially in times where my own family didn't give me encouragement, it was seeing what you do as Asian American creators that did.
