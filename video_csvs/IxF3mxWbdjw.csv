"Thomas P It's just a common haircut, it's not a big deal.
It sounds good for me, you can say you don't like it but don't be disrespectful. There are lots of different songs by the way, you could find something that you would like. And before judging about sexuality please educate yourself about cultural norms of another country and the definition of being gay.",0.1729,72
Thomas P check out their Mic Drop Remix. it's insanely good. You might change your mind and end up deleting this comment!,0.2714,25

"panda lover lol, they are not boybands. They are just musical bands.",0.765,15
"panda lover lol. You don’t understand the difference. I’m not surprised. A boyband is a bunch of young men who sing and dance together and are also generally considered for the way they look to attract girls and gay men. A musical band is a bunch of actual musicians coming together, each with their instruments (usually: lead vocal/keyboard, guitar, bass, and drum, with one of the guitars also sing backup vocal). They can be good looking but usually that’s not one of the criteria. They also don’t do professional dancing. And their age also ranges more widely.",0.6875,123

"too tumblr I watched a video on this subject just yesterday. A guy said it's lip sync every time V opened his mouth (even in slow songs without choreography). I guess he couldn't believe that such a voice exists. And he didn't believe Jungkook because he didn't move his face much while singing. These accusations were hilarious. The sad thing, he got thousands of likes.",0.0258,74
