Are you sure you want to put this story out there.  Without offering me a paying role.  knowing that it originated from the story that I told someone of myself and my father.  Whom was an ELK. Although it was told in the 90s I know life is not fair at times but I've said a little prayer for those that make money off me and don't share.,-0.253,73

"Bem, eu at√© gostei da nova lara, porem achei que eles pecaram na fisionomia da lara, pois nos GAMES ATUAIS ELA TEM FRANJA, O QUE PARA MIM, FEZ EU NAO RECONHECE-LA NA NO QUESITO FISIONOMIA, e olha que o game foi muito elogiado pelos cabelos de lara serem bem detalhados e com a franja que se movimentar de modo bem natural, entao para mim eles pecaram feio ao deixar o cabelo da atriz desce jeito, ja no caso do primeito filme que foi interpretado por ANGELINA JOLIE ela se sobressaiu no papel pelo fato de ter entrado no personagem a ponto de ter a mesma apar√™ncia da dos games o que deu bastante credibilidade a ela !! A mesma coisa coisa foi quando Angelina Jolie fez mal√©vola fivou perfeito o figurino, e a hist√≥ria digna de aplausos!! Mais uma vez parab√©ns para ela rs.. ent√£o eles fizeram a lara ficar inreconhecivel",-0.8021,164
"Bem, eu gostei dela no papel, so nao gostei da fisionomia dela, pois nos games o cabelo dela tem franja, o que ja caracterizou a nova lara, ai nos filmes ela vem inreconhecivel pois nao tem a franja jogada sobre o rosto o que inclusive foi bem elogiado pela Square enix pois o trabalho detalhado do cabelo dela deu naturalidade se tornou parte da personalidade dela, o que tiraram no filme e por conta disso tornou a lara inreconhecivel",-0.5267,85

I don't know man I'm not getting a good vibe here. The actor doesn't look like Lara from either game series.,-0.5448,23
I honestly think that the original Tomb Raider movie was closer to the original Tomb Raider game than this. They're not even trying to follow the plot of the Tomb Raider franchise here.,0.765,35
I hope she's humorous like Angelina,0.7906,6

"I want to see this, Alicia V. looks amazing.",0.6249,12
"I was excited when this movie was announced, but this is actually so lazy and uninteresting. They ripped everything straight from the 2013 game right down to the storyboards and action shots seen here! Why would I want to pay to see this when I've already played through this story 5 times? Don't go see this, stay home and play the game instead so Crystal Dynamics can continue bringing us more mind-blowing sequels and other content. THOSE writers are the real heroes here and I seriously doubt they'll be getting any of the credit or pay for this. Maybe Hollywood will put actual effort into our favorite gaming franchises one day, but given history, it's not likely. 

Alicia Vikander looks fantastic, though, and I'm sure she'll give a great performance. Go see her in something else, like maybe The Man From UNCLE with Henry Cavill. At least that remake is from a story old enough to warrant the attention, and Guy Ritchie always delivers.",0.9859,181
