"Clues in The Last Jedi as to the Identity of Snoke:

A lot of people seem to have missed this important clue in The Last jedi. There is a line in the movie where it is revealed that the Force tries to keep balance between darkside and lightside, so that when a person is very strong in the darkside, another person will appear who is strong in the light side.

This is supposed to explain where Rey came from, and that she is a balance to Kylo rens power in the darkside.

But what does this say about Snoke? It means snoke must have a equal ""light side"" balance as well. Who could this be? well one person who stands out as a candiate would be leia. She seems to have a LOT stronger force powers right when Snoke is suddenly becoming powerful as well. It also fits because they are opposites in many ways. They both lead opposing armies. Snoke is an ugly male alien, while Leia is/was a beautiful princess. Leia was the rejected parent of Kylo, while Snoke is a kind of adopted parent/mentor. etc

Basically, Snoke is the forces answer to Leia. He is the balance to her power. He is the Anti-Leia.",0.9365,235

Seen twice to try sway my opinion but still nope didnt enjoy atall. Hardly any story line to this, Lack of Lighstaber duels, no explanation of Snoke. Casino scene, love story of finn and rose-pointless, kylo ren lacking any sort of intimidation that Vadar pocessed-just reminds me of a spoilt brat. Lack of Battles, crap humour need i go on the list is never ending with the faults. Disney have fucked it and are basically just using it as a money booster.

I personally did not like the story.

It would just be the New Order taking over the galaxy with Snoke & Kylo Ren. Without a peep of the Resistance from rebels. 3: the lightsaber action was NONEXISTANT!!! You can't have a Star Wars flick without a 10 to 15 minute multiple duels.Disney should have stuck with the original back story on what really happend after the Empire and the Jedi.

No matter how hard you fight to wipe out the baddies - new baddies just step into their shoes when they are defeated, but so do new heros to bring them down. 2. This story has no ending - it just repeats the cycle every 40 years or so - literally and figuratively! and 3.

The movie in itself didn't have much of a beginning and an end as much as it had... things happening one after another.

But, being honest, the same thing can kinda be said about Empire. It was just people going places kinda hoping it'd be somehow beneficial to them in the long run and then encountering problems at those places, with no real progress being made toward any sort of big end goal. 

But, hell, it worked. And I think The Last Jedi worked pretty well too. I have some lingering doubts about it, but I need to watch it again to clear my thoughts on it.",0.6862,193

Or call in a few of the other thousands of ships they had to jump in right in front of them? That part of the plot made no sense. Think about it.

"You must be joking. MOST of the neanderthalian Star Wars purists despise every single prequel movie. The only thing they SOMEWHAT appreciate is the world-building that was canonized.

And you must have not been around the community when they introduced the animation for the newer, 3D Clone Wars series. They immediately turned their nose up at it like the mewling crybabies they are. SOME, thankfully, can step out of their delusions and admit the older 2D CW series was good.

The only thing universally liked outside of the OG trilogy are KOTR games.",0.7383,103

"chocolateymilkshards Dude of course anyone would hate the 3D animation when it first came out, it was just horrible from pretty much all standards, but people managed to ignore that when the show came out as the story was amazing, and the animation got better over time so no one really complained about it anymore.
And no, most people in the Star Wars community admit these movies were good or ok, even the most hardcore people, besides even if they didn't like it they still ABSOLUTELY ADORED Star Wars Legends, no denying there, its not the main OG trilogy timeline but its considered amazing, some people even consider it better than the main trilogy for the things it brings to the table and the stories it tells.",-0.343,138
