"""Omission""

the memory you have is pathological craft
with attacks on Africans and Jews
straight up white supremacist 
discriminating, discovering nothing
but valueless concepts
giving your own reality a reject see
I follow Buddha's precepts
because they imitate projection
you impotent ass lost me
when you imposed destitution 
the impoverished days are over 
because I stand for revolution
you imposter with an impious impetus
you ain't plausible, just an inaudible 
hawk, you objective remains questionable
impeachments coming soon
to this founding father of doom
you too rich to presume
I got you vomiting fumes
you ain't merciful, your too hurtful
half-witted and unembraced
like the argument of Dylan Roof's motives
your every disease in one human body
we need to desecrate you
forget you derelict
don't ever try to tweet again
because your hatred's large
but your brain size is thin",-0.964,147

"LYRICS

Pt. I

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don‚Äôt shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it‚Äôs no use
We ain‚Äôt ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where‚Äôd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up‚Äôs the only time attention‚Äôs paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can‚Äôt escape the sirens
Don‚Äôt take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate‚Äôs the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we‚Äôre trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil‚Äôs face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we‚Äôre guilty ‚Äòcause we‚Äôre black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats‚Äù
Single mother strugglin‚Äô through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be ‚Äúcapped in America‚Äù like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed

Eminem should keep politics out of his songs (I know he has used it before, but he doesn‚Äôt need to make entire songs about it). I‚Äôm not here to hear your opinion on Donald Trump, racism, or any other political shit. I‚Äôm here to listen to Eminem. We get that Hip Hop has forgot about you, but stop seeing this stuff as a way to win people back. It‚Äôs just low hanging fruit, and not what we expect out of ‚ÄúHop-Hops Best‚Äù rapper. I don‚Äôt like this song. The vocals are bad, the idea was poorly executed, and overall made ‚ÄòRevival‚Äô seem that much worse. Get off of the Trump hate train, and get back to being a Rap God. And I don‚Äôt have a problem with you throwing in a little political commentary like you did at the beginning of ‚ÄòRap God‚Äô... but this shit is just too much.",-0.9827,205
