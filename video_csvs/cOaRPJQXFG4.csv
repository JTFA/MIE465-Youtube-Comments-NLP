I kinda understand your point. When he did Roxanne with Sean Paul at the Grammys a few years ago I didn't readily gravitate towards it at time. But I guess if you listen to it a few times in a quiet environment it will grow on you. But like you I would really like to hear it with just Sting alone.,0.4588,65

"Repetitive chanting bolstered by Sting's usual flair for hit-worthy songwriting. Thanks to Mr. Sumner it doesn't stink on ice but to say this is groundbreaking is a laugh. I suppose for Gordon, resurrecting a waning career that was _marked_ by groundbreaking achievements,  is good news.",0.8963,51
