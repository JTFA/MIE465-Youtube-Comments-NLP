"Another great video. Enjoyed the info about your stove. As a student of wood combustion science, it has been very interesting to see the great design improvements of wood stove technology over the past 30yrs.  Up until the 90s, stoves pretty much were the same as in the 1800s, it is only recently that we are seeing the efficiency improve greatly. Generally half the energy is left in the smoke when burning wood, so you can double the heat output if you can get the combustion hotter and more complete.  The nice thing about better burning is, very little soot. and the glass will remain crystal clear. 
The rocket design is a good one but my preference is still to be able to enjoy the warm glow and light of the fire which is lost on the rocket.  
Get yourself to a good wood stove store and experience how they burn.  You seem to have a good scientific/ engineering mind and will easily understand what is happening with the better combustion stoves.  My Thelin Parlor T4000 wood stove is beautiful to watch burn and has fantastic secondary combustion above the fire. 
Lastly, what options are available to create a vent to the outside air for the stove inlet?  Pulling in outside air would allow the cabin itself to not need to draw in freezing air to feed the fire.",0.9915,249

"Does that stove allow you to slide the grate that the ashes fall through closed?  I have a hearthstone stove and it has the ash pan under it aswell, but the grate in the floor of the firebox can slide closed, this allows less air to escape into that ash pan and  creates a much more airtight burn, after the stove heats up into the high end of the burn zone  I then close my primary air flow and the secondary smoke after burn begins and the whole load of wood will burn slower and much more efficiently not allowing as much energy loss up the chimney as it gets burned twice before exiting.",0.8148,119

‚Ä¶..RVM45",0.89,60
"From what I can see you either need to insulate your cabin more and thus need less heat. Shame to cover over that wood as it looks so nice.
Or
It sounds like you need to get a 2nd (and ideally preheated refresh air supply ) in to the smoke at the top of the stove so the more of the smoke burns and thus you get more heat which requires less fuel. 
So
you could take this a step further by adding a 2nd burn chamber (with a preheated air supply) ie an old 15 kg gas bottle.
designs can be found online but basically: allow the flue to go up into the gas bottle, add new air to the base of this flue, vent the burn gases from about 1/3 up the gas bottle. in short the 2nd burn has to go up, then down a bit, before going up the flue.

Good luck",0.9144,170

We've got a place near haliburton in our family, haven't been able to spend as much time as we'd like there last while...so watching your videos helps!

Serial # of the stove should confirm exact parts we would need to bring that thing up to spec. You do want to be cautious burning with the ash door open, that'll likely over-fire the unit and could cause damage and other bad things, if done for too long..

Even to this day 50 years hence my brother and my sister still living on the Rock use a wood furnace as part of heating system. I can tell you that you are not going to want to do this long term. You become focused on keeping the fire going and the wood lot full, especially if it is your only source of heat. Why not consider adding something more modern like solar thermal or geo thermal. Add in some solar panels and then a minisplit. There are some many better options over burning wood. Also, consider a long term plan where you heat source is large a centralized facility for all the building you are planning to build. You will not want to build a heat source in each building.

That way the Selkirk never gets any creosote build up and I can replace the stove pipe every few years just by going up on the roof and pulling the whole thing up. Drop a new one in, put the cap back on and I'm good to go for another few years. Of course it only works if you don't have any bends in your setup. You also end up with a 1/2 inch gap between the two pipes but I've never had any problems with it after more than 20 years of running it this way.",0.757,172

"I really enjoy your videos. You do some really good authentic old school things that most people have forgotten.One thing it seems you have overlooked is a huge rock chimney and hearth. Any original old cabin ( not a recreated or relocated) always had a fireplace that was huge and it was usually always on the center of your A-frame on your back wall directly opposite your front door.
This wasn‚Äôt an accident they were all built this way it was how you were able to keep the cabin warm. Most were built with the front door facing south and the north or coldest wall was almost entirely rock with a huge hearth. With only a small fire burning constantly the mass would keep the cabin warm.
I‚Äôve seen a lot of old sites of 20x20 cabins that had been gone more than 100 years that still had the pile of rocks from the chimney and hearth that probably weighed 30 to 40 tons. This is probably where the idea of rocket mass came from. I‚Äôm sure cob was around back then too but in most places rock was a nuisance and needed to be picked up and used to get it out of the way for farming. 
I‚Äôm sure everyone has seen sites of old cabins  most have been disturbed or raided for the rocks and it‚Äôs hard to tell but if you find one in tack you really need to take note of how they were building them and why.",0.6425,273
"I really think that your initial idea of building a stone hearth up that back wall would be the best for both a barrier, and retaining that heat and radiating it out overnight. The stone/clay mortar would probably be your best bet as far as efficiently heating it goes. The stove itself there isn't a lot you could do to it other than replacing the gaskets - or if you end up finding one with the dampers and changing it out eventually (wouldn't be too much of a hassle, as long as you could find one with the same sized connections). I get the romance of the glass doors though, it's definitely prettier.

When I finally get some property for myself I am definitely building one, as it will consume a miniscule amount of fuel and only need to be fired like twice a day with a handful of kindling each time (presumably when you would cook meals- ovens and stovetops are implemented into these designs. Many designs also implement a ""sleeping shelf"" which I will include in mine... Someday...",0.5562,160

"I was told, when living in The Yukon, that burning birch wood every now and then reduces the amount of soot in your chimney. I used about 7-8 cords of wood each year and made sure that about 1/2 of it was birch. Cleaned my chimney every 6 weeks or so and had less than 1 cup of soot every time. Don't know if this is a lot or not (I used the stove from october to april so about 7 months a year). The bulk of the wood I used was cured pine and spruce. I lived in an old trailer btw so poorly insulated. As always a great video an very informative.",0.7506,125
"I wonder why no one seems to use tiled stoves in the US or Canada (something like http://www.homethingspast.com/tiled-stoves/ or http://ceresit-pro.pl/img/original/6802.jpg ) which are very popular in eastern Europe (Russia) or northern Europe (Sweden) where they also have very harsh winters. 
They have huge amounts of chamotte stone / fire brick built in. This thermal mass keeps and stores the heat during a whole day. (http://www.grundofen.de/tl_files/03grundofen/grundofen_parabel.jpg )
Also, the burning gases / hot air is lead through a meander of internal heat exchange flue channels until it reaches the chimney for higher energy efficiency. 
In this way, you can keep the stove for many hours or even a whole day unattended ( http://www.grundofen.de/tl_files/03grundofen/grundofen_parabel.jpg )

Iron stoves, in contrast, are inexpensive, take only little space, and are easy to install, but they are thermally inefficient for two reasons: 
1. the hot gas travels only a short distance from fire to chimney, unable to transfer all the heat to the room or thermal mass, so the gas is still hot when it reaches the chimney and a lot of energy is lost and firewood is wasted.
2. the thermal mass is too low to store the heat for a long time (which would allow the fire to be unattended for a long time).

The Rocket Mass Heater seems to be a modern re-invention of the tiled stove principle (thermal mass + long flue channels), but without the traditional aesthetics and taking up much more floor space.

For permanent living double walls with insulation would probably good: https://www.leonwood.de/fileadmin/inhalte/Bau_u_Oekologie/Wandausfuehrungen/Bio_Doppelwand_round/biodoppelwand-round.png",-0.5499,285
I wouldn't bother with the every day fire that gets up into the top range of the burn zone - to burn off creosote.

"Its really a great efficient stove!!!  If you ever have any questions about that stove feel free to ask, the husband know that baby very well, I'll have him chat with you about it.  Two years ago we thought we would have to replace it, but he found a guy that he could get replacements parts for the inner plates and pins and totally took that thing apart and re-built it...    Oh and your wife got that for you for a steal!!!   The older models with the Catalytic Combusters are hard to find down here in the states...   With the newer Encore models  Vermont Castings did away with the CC, so nobody wants to get rid of the old ones from the 70's and 80's, so they can go for a heck of a lot more money then what she paid for yours...     Your cabin is amazing by the way, I love that kitchen sink with the hand pump, I would love one of those in my house!!!",0.9797,192
"I‚Äôm sure the Vermont Castings people will take issue with your insinuation that they built an inefficient stove. ¬†The glass doors are meant to allow quick heat into the room. The rest of the stove is heavy providing thermal mass. The heat that escapes through the glass is good heat and will infect heat absorbing material in the cabin. ¬†What you do not want is a lot of cabin air entering the combustion chamber, thus sucking in cold air--it is a balance to be sure. ¬†My suspicion is that, even with an outside air source, you have plenty of ‚Äúleakage‚Äù of air to ensure safety and adequate fresh air. ¬†Eliminating negative air pressure will make a big difference especially with a porous cabin with few to no vapor barriers. ¬†You got a steal on that stove--a good servicing with new gaskets should bring it back to almost new condition. ¬†And the glass does add a nice esthetic touch to cabin in the woods.

"No matter what stove or system you put in unless the insulation of the walls, roof, and even the floor isn't reinforced the problem of inefficient wood use will still exist, just not as bad.

Fixing the floor is easy. It is flat and there are many insulation options. Most very cheap and easy to install. The same goes for the ceiling. However, those beautiful, but very uneven walls would be tougher. A simple solution that works well and is easy to install would be to cover at least one wall with a curtain. Wool-like material. In the warmer seasons, it can be opened or taken down to reveal the wood.

Looking forward to the rocket stove. It will at least even out the temperature.",0.962,142

VERMONT CASTINGS are great looking and have some cool features. But way too over priced and do not burn efficiently. I  a PACIFIC ENERGY sheet metal stove kicks ass and has for 6 years.

"We have that same exact Vermont Castings stove in our keeping room fireplace, same color too, ours is from the 80's and has a catalytic combustor which is controlled by that lever on the left...  That stove if you really figure our how it works heats a 1700 sq ft section or our house...   First off your door handle didn't break off, it fell of and got lost.  If you google ""Ceramic Fallaway Handle ""  you can buy one on line, Amazon sells them, ours had to be replaced, the dog broke it...  It hangs in a hole at the bottom of the right side of the stove...   Also how we work our stove is we load it up and do what's called a Top burn"" to get it started  We put the kindling on top of the wood pile not the bottom... We keep the thermometer that you have on the stove pipe on the griddle plate of the stove...  That handle to the right is an air control, you want that forward/open while getting the stove up to temp...  and the the catalytic combuster open...  When the stove gets up to 525F to 550F you close the Catalytic combuster and turn the air control down so the handle is straight down...   When you add wood you add it from the top, you open the CC turn up your air control first, add your wood, get it back up to temp again before you close the CC and turn down the air control  We'll load up that stove before we go to bed, at midnight and wake up at 5 am ,  and have coals in the bottom to get her started again...  That's when you open that bottom tray a bit too...  In the morning we gently knock some excess ash into the pan, being careful not to loose the lit coals, and dump the ash pan in a metal ash bucket.    We put some dry twigs or kindling in the bottom and fill the stove with wood, open the CC turn up the air control, and leave that bottom pan open just long enough to get the wood to burning then close it up...  Let the stove come to temp and close it like before...   This model stove is a favorite in the States, and if you wood is seasoned and you use hardwoods it works great...",0.8577,438

"You can make the stove a bit more efficient by adding thermal mass to it. Get, or make, a thick plate (say an inch or two) of cast iron the size of the top of your stove and sit it on top with as much surface contact as possible. You can bolt plates on the sides as well, so while you are drilling into it might as well add an adjustable air intake (just a hole with a little metallic cover screwed over it with a single screw; you can slide the little door to give the stove more or less air). The added mass will keep more heat inside the cabin, and will keep radiating heat long after the fire has died down. The downside is that it will take longer for the top to get to cooking heat, but we all know everything is a compromise.
