I just wanted to say thank you!
Thank you for being so open,
for sharing your experiences and things you've learned.
Thank you for making me feel that I'm not alone with my feelings of being stuck or anxious without preaching this one way to solving all of ones problems.

And thank you, universe, for bringing Ingrid into my life (yes I feel like Ingrid really is present in my life lol). This year I went through some major self realigning and redefining. I feel like discovering Ingrid during this time was absolutely meant to happen. Secondly, although I feel like I could call lots of things that has happened last year as “lows”, I do feel that those were transitional moments that absolutely needed and were overdue to happen in my life. I am grateful for this major transition that led me to finally find my true self and find meaningful, connected, and all around integrated life 💫 Love you Ingrid, you truly bring so much light in this world ❤️",0.9847,160

"Hey Ingrid!
I'm really enjoying this video so far, and your 'lows' for 2017 are really resonating with me. I felt pretty devastated by the election too, and I too felt very stuck after that. I actually took the entire year of 2017 off of making videos, after having made videos since 2011. I am just now coming around to thinking about uploading again because I miss it so much, but it was such a bummer for me that I couldn't even watch any youtube videos all of last year either. I'm glad for the time I took off though, because it gave me a chance to rethink my content, and imagine ways to make it reflect the more meaningful life I had decided I wanted to live.
Anyway, I hope your 2018 is wonderful!!

Sarah Nicole",0.9743,156

"I cannot think about 2017 without remembering this was the year I finally was selected to be in the studio audience at Saturday Night Live. I had to plan a last minute trip to NYC I took my mom along for her first trip to New York and it was the best time! I may have cried when the folks at NBC put on my wristband that would get me my seat to see the show. And a definite low is just the division in this Country, the bigotry, all the sexual assault/harassment charges, I have had straight up panic attacks thinking about members of my family and what might happen to them....I can go on and on but you get it. But I’m feeling hopeful that things can be fixed and turned around. But honestly I don’t think I can handle watching another white nationalist rally.....that went TOO FAR for me.

"I definitely had a lot of lows in 2017, but I also had the biggest high of - I would say - my whole life, in 2017.
After many years of personal development I came to the point, that I want to give the vegan lifestyle a chance. I ""allowed"" me to make a few exceptions over the year, but as it turned out, I didn't want to do it in the end :-). I never felt so at peace with myself and the world <3. For me it was eye-opening :-).",0.8755,104
"I feel like my biggest low was feeling like I was never going to get a job after I graduated college. I was back at my parents and even though I pushed through everyday, I felt so defeated. I look back now at those months and I know see it as a huge blessing because if it wasn't for that period of brief hardship, I wouldnt have appreciated everything I have now! It was my dream to work with honeybees and I've not only landed a job as a honeybee biologist, but I've also been able to move out and become a more independent person. Another thing I'm grateful for during those months of self doubt is through those months I've finally created a YouTube channel to become part of the community in a greater way. So now I find myself at the beginning of the year with everything that I wanted in 2017. Although I'm unsure of what's going to come out of 2018, I want to remain positive and remind myself that the moments of great self doubt can lead to exactly what you want if you push hard enough and never give up on yourself.

"Ingrid, thank you for sharing. Thank you for showing us life has it all, the highs and the lows, that you have joys and fears. 

Lows: I got diagnosed with some scary shit that basically means the pressure in my brain was too high which was causing me to go blind, so I had to have surgery for that. As a result, half of my face got paralysed (it was supposed to heal completely but it didn't, it's much better though) and I have chronic migraines. Because of all of this, I'll be retaking some classes at school and I lost some clients at my job. It also led to being diagnosed with liver problems and they are now investigating my heart, as apparently it's not doing it's job decently - though discovering all of this is also kind of a high, it explains so much!  
Highs: I started my own business, I moved in with my girlfriend, my sister graduated university and got herself a job, right at the end of the year (seriously, the 26th of December) I found a product for my hair that really seems to work after years of struggling with it, I randomly drove to Denmark (from Belgium) to visit a friend, I went to the scout Moot in Iceland where I also visited a friend.",-0.6957,252

"LOWS:
- Cutting out toxic friends and also falling out of friendships I thought would last longer (lost around 3-5 people)
- I switched anti-depressants this year after being on one for 2.5 years and finding out it was causing unwanted symptoms. The new one was terrible and I never felt so anxious or low in my whole life. Even the lowest time before that that pushed me to getting medication for it wasn't that bad and I couldn't take it for more than a month and half before it was too much. That month and a half was extremely difficult and it's been almost 3 months since then and I'm still dealing with the aftermath.
- It's the first time in 2.5 years I haven't been taking anti depressants and it's been a struggle. Being medication free has a lot of benefits but it is definitely a lot harder to manage my anxiety without it.
- My mom, brother and I moved in with my mothers partner. It was really hard and stressful because my mom raised my brother and I all by herself for most of my life so moving in with  someone that was basically a stranger was really hard. It was also hard because I have trust issues and the idea of letting another person in our lives that could possibly abandon us scared me.
- My work life became really difficult because a good friend became a supervisor and due to the stress of the job took it out on me and my coworkers which strained our relationship. On top of that my work environment became a lot more toxic and I dreaded going to work but I had to because I need the money.
- My self esteem was on a rollercoaster throughout the year due to toxic friendships, mental health issues and unrealistic expectations I tend to put on myself. 
- I had to get my hamster euthanized due to head injury and I felt incredibly guilty. I didn't know how serious it was and procrastinated taking her to the doctor, thinking she could last another day but I was so wrong. She was in so much pain and the vet said she had possible brain damage and she didn't have much time left. I was upset because my mom brought her while I was at school and I couldn't be there when she was being put down and I just felt terrible. She was in so much pain and I just beat myself up over it for a long time.

HIGHS:
- I met my current boyfriend in april 2017 and I'm in my first serious relationship. It has been rocky here and there but I'm grateful to have him in my life. It's my first time feeling loved and loving another person (besides family or platonic love) and it's an interesting experience.
- I did a lot of hiking in the summer and managed to make it to the top of a really difficult hike despite being on my period, having asthma, being unfit and being afraid of heights. I ended up crying near the top when we were scrambling because my asthma was getting to me and I looked over the edge and realized how high I was. I made it to the top and felt accomplished though! I did around 5-6 hikes in 2 months and it was great!
- I've been more consistent with working out and I'm finally seeing results physically and mentally. Although I'm still struggling with my self esteem, my perspective towards fitness and body image has shifted. 
- I've lost 18 lbs and it was the first year I was successful at losing weight and keeping it off. I have 15 more to go but I'm more motivated and have a healthier mindset to lose it.
- I finally started getting therapy for my anxiety and depression. I'm getting CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) and it was a huge step for me to reach out and get the help. I've always been a self sufficient person and hated admitting i needed help or asking for help. I'm happy I'm doing it now because after the shitty medication situation I realized I really needed to get professional help.
- Starting taking more care for my mental health. Rather than ignoring or distracting myself I've been trying to combat it. I'm happy I'm medication free for now.
- I achieved my goal for cutting out red meat entirely! I've been red meat free for over a year now. Becoming vegetarian or pescetarian has been something that has always been on my mind but never actually took the steps to do. But I managed to cut a huge part of meat consumption and maintain it. My next goal is to cut down drastically on poultry.
- I finally knitted a whole scarf. I've always wanted to knit a scarf but never did it. It's too short and kind of crappy but I'm happy I finally did it!
- I've rekindled friendships I lost the years before and it's been nice to reconnect. Although it's still hard losing people, it's given me the opportunity to become closer to others that are better fit for me.
- I took more steps toward self care. I went to the doctors, got exams, tests and just stopped procrastinating when it comes to getting important things checked. I've always been terrified of going to the OBGYN but I got a pelvic exam and I was proud I just did it for my health.

"Lows: this is kind of ironic but the eclipse was a turning point for me too but not in a good way. Aug 21st was actually my 22nd birthday, I had recently graduated from university and was supposed to go to grad school the following week. But I felt that it wasn’t the right time for me and rescinded my acceptance. The day of the eclipse, though, I realized that I was much lonelier and directionless than I had previously thought. All my friends from college had moved away. Despite my recently acquired cum laude degree I could not find a job to save my life and without the prospect of graduate school, for the first time in my life I had no idea what the future had in store for me. I had no direction, no job and no long term goals to follow and I didn’t have any close friends around for support. I spent the day of the eclipse making my own birthday cake and convincing myself that my life wasn’t a series of huge mistakes. I can’t say I have really gotten out of this low but I do feel much more positive about 2018.
Highs: I did actually graduate from University cum laude which is pretty awesome. I went on a cruise for spring break and one of my best friends got married. I also got to travel to 30 different stares as a part of a volunteer relief organization. 
It’s been a great year watching you Ingrid, Happy 2018!!",0.9937,287
"Lows: what I thought was just me and my shyness became actual anxiety and I stopped being able to go out as much as I used to and I got really ill the day after graduation :/
Highs: I got to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child multiple times and I graduated from university with a 2:1! :D

However, just so you know, I cry every time I get on a plane, even when he's flying it, so I get the fear 🤣 xx",-0.7537,97

My Lows:
1. Getting into a third car accident in 2 years, all of which totalled the car I had at the time, and financially dealing with that.
2. Feeling stuck at my job, which was very mentally unstimulating.
3. Being BEYOND stressed at my new job, which I thought would be good but turned out to be a horrible mistake, and feeling lost and stuck.

My Highs:
1. Moving out and living on my own, then moving in with my boyfriend
2. Traveling! I went to 3 new places this year which was so great.",-0.4443,129

"The same thing happened to me on a plane to France! We ended up circling and then being able to land but feeling the plane go back up was terrifying.

"This was the year that was pretty unplanned for me. I finished my graduate degree to find the job market not as ripe as when I started the program. I had to take jobs outside of my field and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t pretty discouraging. I had a really bad renting situation for the first 6 months of the year, a lot of my long time friendships fizzled out, and yeah just general stuff that happens in the news. The good things were i finished my masters! This year my worldview and beliefs changed A LOT. I gained a lot of confidence. I got to live downtown in a city I love and do a bit of traveling.

"YES, right with you with the Saturn return.  I'm 29...and a half lol. I read about it back when I was 25 and started studying astrology and I had just had a 9 year relationship end with somehow who I found out was going through HIS Saturn return in the 7th house of partnerships....so I was dreading this year for sure. It's had a lot of highs and lows, more than any year I've had thus far, but I've grown in so many ways and faced so many fears that I'm actually very grateful. I was literally stuck for years in my anxiety, didn't work outside of the house, couldn't bring myself to date after my relationship ended. This year I lived a totally different life, and I am so glad I was pushed out of my comfort zone.",0.817,155

"graduating from secondary school was definitely both a high and a low for me. a high because of all the celebrating and because of reaching another mile stone in my life. but afterwards came the lowest of lows because I was left on the other side of school with friends either working constantly or back in school at uni working towards their own dreams whereas I was completely lost. I didn't have a job, I had no idea what I wanted to study (still don't). it was hard going out with job applications after job applications only to either never hear from the company or be turned down. it was hard hearing and seeing on social media what all my friends were up to when I felt like I was doing nothing with my life at all. only now, half a year after graduation, am I starting to find my feet again on the other side of graduation. I got two new jobs that I love and I feel like I'm finally working towards something. what that something is I don't know yet, but it's a work in progress as everything is in life.
