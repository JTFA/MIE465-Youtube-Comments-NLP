"Come on man! That ""you'll get used to it"" attitude is arrogant to the extreme. Why should I get used to it an electronic device that it's supposed to make my life easier? Are dongles easier to use? Is that ridiculous price acceptable for animojis, since that's basically every YouTuber excuse. Is a obstruction on my screen acceptable? Lack of a fast charger in the box on an already super expensive device, acceptable? Lack of fingerprint scanner as an option, acceptable? There's a lot wrong with this phone and in my personal case I was one of the few who suffered those cold weather freezes and glitches so I returned it. Steve Jobs idea was for a product that's easy to use, intuitive, well crafted, designed to accommodate the user... Not the other way around.

Regarding the notch and the whole ""you'll get used to it"" attitude, it's true though, you will adapt to it. Just like how people adapted to Lightning from 30-pin connectors. Just like how people are now using Dongles on their MacBooks. It's normal, it's all in the business of making money. Companies don't really care about consumers, because they know that consumers will buy their products regardless if they market it properly. If you're trying to pick every little bad thing in a ¬†smartphone, there will never ever be the right phone for you. The iPhone X may not be the right one for you, but it may be for someone else. You also have to remind yourself that this is the first generation of its kind, there will be more like these in the future. Better ones, that'll address your issues altogether.",0.957,228

"M Morales 
Steve Jobs used to remove ports all the time, he didn't want us to stay in the past.
Cuz he always knew there was a better way to do everything. 
The notch isn't a obstruction it's a extension, cause you can put the statusbar icons in the ""ears"".
You DON'T HAVE TO use dongles with your iPhone. Some people will even ask why it doesn't have Usb-C.....welll cuz Apple is sooo closee to removing the lightning port. It's really not needed. 
Not having a fingerprint scanner as an option is totally fine... Face-id is amazing and you almost don't even notice that your phone is locked. The iPhone X is just different from all those Android phones that basically look the same: tin side bezels and a medium forehead and chin.
It's a unique phone and the best one",0.8928,157

"S Watson kk, have you ever heard of the emoji movie? Huge flop. How about Pixels? Critics hated it.  Animojis to me are everything terrible about Apple combined with everything terrible about communication, combined. But to deal with animoji, I've got to deal with emoji first.
Emoji: They're the ""good enough"" of communication. To me, it's what seems like communication, but fails to realise what communication is about. Maybe I'm ruined forever because the course I studied was graphic design, but to me, communication should enable you to express yourself, uniquely and authentically. Ultimately emoji are laziness in communication, using terribly designed tiny icons (most emoji sets look like they came from 2003) to represent all the breadth and depth of human emotion, and they nearly always fail. At a time when we're supposed to be more connected than ever, we obfuscate what we're trying to say with an icon drawn by somebody else, designed to fit into the style a larger set of icons. A picture is worth a thousand words is a lie unless pictures are actually thought out. Want evidence? How many emoji are there? How many emoji do people feel safe using? People limit themselves to a small set of emoji where the meaning of the emoji is already commonly understood, thereby  proving that the emoji are only rarely sufficient to accurately convey what people want to say, and in those cases, 90% of us use them to say the same things. The other 10% are speaking gibberish.
Going back to your original question, saying the other emoji apart from the paperclip are irrelevant was a joke playing upon the meme that is clippy from MS Office. Wouldn't it be ironic if you could map the paperclip emoji with eyes to your face on an Apple device using technology taken directly from the Xbox Kinect? What I mean is that unless there is cultural weight behind images, they're meaningless for most people. A paperclip by itself is a relatively useless icon, but a paperclip with eyes carries cultural weight. The same thing has happened to all the emoji that people commonly use ‚Äî along the way they have been given cultural meaning. Therefore, if you aren't interested in saying the same things as your culture, you should probably avoid emoji. I think kids these days understand this better than their parents, and with memes and Snapchat stickers become armed with a cultural vocabulary much greater than emoji will ever be. While everyone else says the same things in the same way, they cut through.
Ok, so moving onto animoji, you're essentially trying to deal with the problems of emoji not being able to express things well by using those same symbols and then combining them with the least democratic device ever made. It's $1000, it has no headphone jack (still), it forces a new way of using the phone onto its users while keeping the old comfortable alternative around (Windows 8.1 much?) on the most closed-in phone system around, creating a class barrier, a convenience barrier, a technological barrier, an adoption barrier, that all help prevent their ""fix"" for emoji from being adopted and democratised.
Basically you're giving people a tool that they're forced to use in a limited way (only on the iPhone X), to express a limited range of things (only these pre-selected emotions, thanks,) and will hopefully therefore have a limited lifespan.",-0.7704,650

"Sorry, animojis are just idiotic. Other AR applications such as object scanning or snapchat's filters allow users to share things with actual creative input. Animojis are a very limited subset of a limited set of characters that users can't really make their own. Unless I can be an animated paper-clip, it's not even culturally relevant. it'll get old extraordinarily quickly unless they add Clippy, stat. Other messaging platforms like snapchat allow the user to get creative whereas animoji seems like you'll just be sending the same dumb sh*t (literally) as everyone else.",0.4963,105
