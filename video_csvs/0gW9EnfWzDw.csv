"Honestly lol the only accurate points I've seen so far (i work at subway) are the part about staring at top left at 45 degree angle when toasting 😭😂😂😂😂 and the stingy but also heavy amounts of vegetables, the smack tf out of the mayo, and the cutting. Now honestly. I work for a franchisee. I like our food tbh and we make it pretty good (Except ham, turkey, and oven roasted chicken, that shit all nasty asf.) But our job is bullshit. I get barely minimum wage to do everything except manager work. My lunch is literally just a six inch (with no extras allowed unless u wanna pay for them) and I can't get chips or anything. Our subway and it's owners are just bullshit. Fuck it. Fuck my job so much. We don't even get good tips. Like today I got 63 cents (our owner always keeps a few dollars, and the rest is divided by the workers.. today it was divided by 4.) And some coworkers are stupid and assholes. And they text to a stupid ass group chat. And like our boss has so much audacity.. he sends us fuckin disappointed emojis when we fuck up the slightest bit.. I gotta quit already lmao.",-0.9875,244

"I have the opposite problem in almost every regard. Way too much sauce (I only want one strip, to get the flavor not drowning in a pile of sauce), always get veggie subs and the veggie patties are great (sized to 6"", so always the right amount), I get flatbread because the other bread is too thick regardless of cut placement, they pile on the spinach, lettuce is rarely ever good from anywhere. Usually my subs still hot by the time I drive home within 15 minutes.",-0.2037,101

I used to work at Subway so true.,0.5598,9
"I used to work at subway and while this is extremely over exaggerated, I can relate. The bread is hinge cut so it’s not completely down straight the middle so that the sub is easy to open 
Meats if dropped are always throw into the bin and cheese is to be placed specifically so that they can lay over each other so there is what they call “optimal cheese coverage” 
But the looking to the corner when it’s toasting is sooo accurate for a slow day. If it’s busy we have to go off and make another sub but when it’s slow and there’s only one customer is awkward or if you’re like me, you’re awkward and so you don’t really wanna have to make too much conversation. 
The salads have very specific amounts of grams to be used and that’s how many are to be used unless the customer specifically asks for more. The sauces are done in and motion unless you ask for one or two lines 

So I really don’t know who hurt you",-0.6731,205
