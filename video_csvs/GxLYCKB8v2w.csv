"Both girls are great singers as everyone agrees, but Klara has something extra unique about her compared to Johanna ( who sounds generic without Klara she would be nowhere in my opinion), that is when both are singing solo but the two voices blend so well together in harmony ...their new album will be a best seller, wunderbar! K's voice Gold J's Silver ...me? Cadmium :P miss K was born with the gift of an amazing voice , would prefer if she kept lead vocals to herself and let her sister back only.... only joking johanna your both great!",0.99,109

"I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night
As the lights flickered and they failed
I had it all figured out

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

I took a trip out to the frozen lake
And you felt so far away
But I could feel it washing over me
There's no escaping the harsh light of day

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

Stood out on that beach in Chicago
Woke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue
Wherever I went I always knew, always knew
'Till I didn't know",-0.8205,143

"I think you have to go even further back, to end of fifties and the beginning of the sixties. Harmonizing groups were very popular during these years, even if they modernized it there were of course no synthesizers back then. But the style is frorm that era.",0.5095,52

"Just had another listen ...this is melodically PERFECT , this is fucking perfect songwriting and singing , no praise does it full justice, Klara is super talented takes bit of doing to write songs of this quality if people think oh it sounds like something else then try and write one!!! it is NOT an easy thing to do ...whatever method she employs it certainly works , and then her singing is effortlessly brilliant , as a singer she is one of the best we will ever hear and think of all the great female singers there have been ...just the quality of that voice is superb ....hairs go up on the back of your neck when she starts off on this one, can I have yer autograph :P.....feeling like a piece of unwanted shit in the virtual company of this giant :)",0.9933,154

"So basically i had left my relationship with someone i didnt even love. In the very beginning i knew how it would end but still i have waited for it to become better by time. The desire for love got me like hell. So i wasted my fucking time with someone i dont even love.  Yesterday he called me and said to me that he is into someone and he wants to live through the things we lived together with her. Not me. When he told me this i was like ""Holy shit you are right. That is exactly what i wanted deep inside. But i tried to change it."" And we decided that it would be really great if we dont see each other again. While we were having this talk i was outside and i was having a walk. And on my way back home this song came on. I paid attention to the words;
Why do i do this to myself(why?why?)
Everytime i know the way it ends(seriously i fuckin knew)
Before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line(i just tried to deny it, you know)
and i started laughing and damn that was an amazing moment for me. Sometimes; timing is just perfect. And timing is what makes it so special.",0.769,252
