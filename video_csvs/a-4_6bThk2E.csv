There are no excuses and I do not say this to be mean in anyway, for I did not create the conditions of our existence. Hard work and personal responsibility DOES work within our system, even in it's afflicted state.

"An important thing to note about hours based on sales is that it destroys the myth that giving corporations tax breaks creates more jobs. When choosing how many people to hire, or how many hours to give part time employees, companies look at the demand for their product, and then pay wages for the minimum workforce able to meet that demand. They don't calculate the profit they will make and bring people in, they estimate the number of people needed to get the job done. A tax cut for people who don't make enough to spend as much in retail as they want would increase employment, but a tax cut for people who already make more than they need to get by will have a minimal effect, and a tax cut on the corporations will have no effect. Demand drives sales, sales require employees, it is that simple.",-0.8592,161

"As you say, your experience is anecdotal. The same stories occur in Europe, the question is, why so much more often?

Education quality in the US is more stratified than in other developed countries. Schools are not filled with children from diverse backgrounds. There are poor schools and rich schools, which translates to good schools and bad schools - more so than in other developed countries. Is it really fair that kids' education scales with their parents' income, even in public schools? How are you supposed to catch up in income to richer peers, when even before your teenage years you are falling behind?
Of course, after public school comes the expensive part of education. Even with cheap courses you still have to spend your time studying, so the true cost is the price of the course plus the wage you miss out on. Why is education so expensive, compared to other developed countries? Why is the level of education a person typically achieves more strongly tied to their parents' level than in other developed countries? Why do the poor in the US live closer to the poverty line, with fewer savings to spend on education and less time for study? Why, in short, is it harder for poor people to achieve the level of education they want in the US than in other developed countries?

It's true the US population is large. Japan is probably the next-most populous developed nation with half as many people, Germany the second-most populous with half of that. However, no single US state is half as populous a Germany. Why is it that when the states are taken individually and compared to developed countries, they still tend fill out the bottom end of the tables for income equality, health, quality of life etc.? In fact the problem gets even more interesting, since there is pronounced inequality between the states. Why does California rival the most developed countries, while Mississippi struggles to look good even compared to Eastern Europe?",0.5417,376

Today though, slaves willingly line up at the front door of almost every minimum-wage corporation in the world, just begging to be used, abused, and then discarded when they no longer serve a useful purpose. The only difference between the slaves of today and the slaves of old though is that today, the slaves are the ones who have to pay for their own food, clothing, housing, and care.

"Caring, empathy and trust are not gender specific but lets face it, there are many more men that chose not to enter into nursing until wages increased. Deliberate or not, this did historically occur. There are many more marginalized women that have not been given the encouragement or the benefit of educational institutions seeking to admit them as opposed to admitting more men. The funnel into becoming a nurse today we all recognize, is getting accepted into school. We also know that patients want nurses that look, smell, speak, etc like them. This means being male.To all the men that have entered Nursing and recognize that women historically, and without much recognition, elevated Nursing into the highly valued profession that it is today;  bravo to you. For all of the women that do/did this work, we have always wanted to work beside fellow nurses that were caring, empathetic, trustworthy and rolled up their sleeves and worked hard. When the ""number of men in Nursing"" is equated to how men are treated or as if there is something ""wrong"" with nursing/nurses presently practicing that affects the general image of male nurses, this is unworthy and I do not think reflects the majority of male nurses.

Nature might be a harsh mistress, but we don't lie in nature, we live in society. Or has the US devolved to the point of hunter-gathering since I last checked?

I'm sorry if you think you're being patronised. I can only say that I really think you and your fellow Americans born into poverty are missing out on the best the developed world has to offer. The US economy continues to outperform Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia or New Zealand but the benefits are reaped by few. Meanwhile the actual workers in the US are living shorter, unhealthier lives than their counterparts in the developed world, despite spending more on medicine. They are born in the same class they will die in. Their education is lower quality but paradoxically over-patriotic. Their crime is more prevalent and more violent, and so are their police to match. Of course their judges and their press are less free. In almost every measurable sense, quality of life in the US is worst than in these other places. It could be better, it should be better. But here you are making excuses for the system...

I'm sorry you feel this way. I am.",-0.9648,293
"Jharath Nethermoon,

I beg to differ. Underemployment rates vary but are hovering around 13% at the moment. Remember this is the percentage of people actively seeking more work, who have been unable to find it. Is there really enough full-time work out there for those 13%?",0.4497,54
"Jharath Nethermoon,

The economy is still feeling the effects of the recession. The jobs do not exist. Unemployment rates don't tell the whole story because underemployment (having less work or work below your education level) is widespread.",0.0274,43
"Jharath Nethermoon,

The fact is there are countries where the economy works for everyone and the US is not one of them. These are places with less widespread poverty, where poor people have equal access to education (so that poverty is not generational), where people live longer, healthier lives (and spend less on healthcare to boot), where living standards are generally higher across the board.

Where people have taken personal responsibility and, when they've reached the top, have looked back and insisted in more and better provisions for the people who didn't make it - because they recognise two things: 1. that they could have been in different shoes had they had a little less luck and 2. that a more equal society is a better society for everyone, both the poor and the rich, even from a totally objective economic standpoint.

The fact is that the poor in the US _are_ the victims of politics, and their solutions are political, not of 'hard work'. If you 'force yourself to go after it day after day' you will _not_ succeed in the US. Not as often as in other developed countries. Because the system is more stacked against you in America than in other developed countries - to everyone's detriment.

By the way, I'm not struggling financially and looking for someone to blame. And I'm not American. The system is broken - more broken than in other developed countries. Anyone can see that.",-0.6286,277

"Last fall, I was working in a call center in a small college town. I'm a student but I wasn't able to take classes at the time so I wanted to work a minimum of 20 hours a week in order to eat and pay rent. I was barely scraping by on what I was making, getting paid between $8.50 and $11 an hour. Every day I had to walk to work and check the posted schedule to see what project I would work on that day. I found, over the course of a few months, there were days I wasn't assigned to a project at all. It came to the point where I wouldn't be assigned to a project for 4 or 5 days in a row. So no work. No work, no money, no food. I applied for around 10 other jobs and didn't hear back from anyone. As a last resort, I had to move back to live with my mom until I started classes again and got scholarships and financial aid. I can't imagine what it would be like to be a single parent with such an unpredictable job, unable to pay bills or feed my family. Glad some cities are trying to make life more stable for people who haven't had the opportunity to go to college and/or are in tough circumstances.

"Ok I am going to copy past what I said before:

REASON 1: They are not trained because training takes a lot of time and many people are old, have families and other commitments. They also may not be able to handle academic style work. Another reason is that they may be scared of taking a loan out to invest in their own education because they are not confident they will graduate.

REASON 2: They don't like the lifestyle associated with the job. For example my country (NZ) has to get farm workers from other countries because nobody in the main city of Auckland wants to move into the regions... this means instead there are plenty of low skill, but relatively high pay jobs available, but people in the city quite frankly do not want to take the job. Give this article a little read so you can see what I am talking about...  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/99317031/why-small-towns-cant-attract-workers


And I am sorry, but I can understand reason 1 since some people appear to be quite simply not smart or disciplined enough for high skill work.

"When I grew up, one didn't worry about 'good jobs'. One got the best job they could and then learned to live within their means.  That meant no cable if one couldn't afford it. Or a cheap POS car.  Or living with your parents until one could afford to move out. Or not getting married and having kids.  I started as an office clerk and lived with my parents. I then took a couple of classes, paid for by my employer,  learned computer programming, and got a programming job and moved into an apartment with a roommate. When I made enough money, I got my own place and eventually got married. Sadly, we had kids before we were ready (those boxes say 90% effective for a reason) and then struggled for many years. But my wife went to nursing school at nights and got a good job.  In short, we lived within our means and improved our working skills to get better jobs.

Recently, I had a friend whose son started in a call center, learned some skills, got promoted into a tech support role, and finally bought a house and got married. So don't tell me all of the 'good jobs' need a degree.  My step-son did something very similar. My daughter lived with me for several years after she graduated, got a job at Pet Smart as a dog bather, they trained her to be a dog groomer, she used that money for college, and graduated with zero college debt.  All I paid for was one semester, she did it all on her own.  She is now married and has a home and two beautiful children. So don't tell me that the government needs to pay for college either.

The real problem is people want it all. As soon as they can, they want to move out, get a job, get a cell phone, have direct TV/Internet/Netflix, a decent car, get married, have kids, and expect their employer to pay them for their lifestyle instead of their skills.  Some idiot with a degree has told them they have to have a degree 4 years out of high school and didn't tell them the truth that they don't have the slightest idea what life is all about, and it's better to wait until you are 25 or 30.

if you want a good job, work for it. Go out and learn something beyond bagging groceries or stocking shelves at Kroger or Walmart.  And if you don't have the motivation or intelligence to do it, suck it up and learn to live within your means instead of expecting other people to pay you more than you are worth.  If someone else is willing to do your job for less than you are, then you don't deserve to earn more money.

Yes .. it's true that education is the answer. But this is the age of knowledge, education is at your fingertips. There are free online classes.  You don't need a degree to do most jobs, stop listening to that lie. You just have to learn something. Anything, it doesn't matter what. Then find someone that will pay you to start at the entry level doing crap go-fer work as you learn more. Pay your dues before you ask someone to pay you more.  Learn basic accounting, or plumbing, or electrical, or carpentry. And then keep trying to find a job outside beyond Kroger and Walmart. Because unless you get into management, your salary will always suck.  Go work for a landscaping company, then learn how to put down pavers or irrigation or concrete. Get good at it and start your own company.  Or get good enough at it you can manage people instead of doing the manual work.

Automation is the direct response to unions asking too much money for unskilled labor. It's people taking low-paying, unskilled jobs and trying to make careers out of them instead of using them as stepping stones to better jobs.  I got promoted in my first job because I found ways to make my job as an office clerk more efficient.  Then, when I was promoted again to a computer operator, I found ways to improve the efficiency of that job and was given tasks in accounting, where I learned even more skills. That led to writing computer programs to automate some of those functions, which enabled me to get enough experience to get a full-time job writing computer programs with another company.  In other words, I found plenty of opportunities to show my boss that I had skills and could do even more work. I became more valuable.

If someone isn't willing to provide skills that are worth more money, the only one they have to blame for staying in a job that pays low wages is themselves. And if someone is looking for someone else to fix it for them, they have just proven they don't have the motivation or intelligence to deserve a better paying job.",0.9861,939

So I can only look in my town, I tried outside of town but I don't want to risk driving to work, that's like possibly losing everything daily. Get pulled over, lose the car, job and then home.

"consider jobs in healthcare. Staffing is tied to the census which is evaluated on dayshift so you may be told to take unpaid low census day on Tuesday, be called in on your day off on Wed as ""a favor"" then have to come in 4 hrs early on call on Saturday before planned shift.This totally messes with kid interface. Then there is TX practice of hiring only perdiems and working them part and full time but no health insurance or limiting the number of sick days so you lose job if kids are sick and you get sick or you go to work very sick... in a hospital. or how about nursing homes in IL where you are told to work up to 20 hr shift !",-0.9615,135

"this was a fascinating video to watch as someone who is currently living this life of completely unpredictable scheduling and unlivable wages. what i've found is that i can never trust one employer to provide me all the hours i need, and that it's better to have two jobs: one that i know will schedule more hours, and one i know will schedule less. 

i hate doing that tho, bc it inconviences the people at the second workplace. bc often instead of using the people they already have, employers will hire more people in peak business times and schedule them for 8 or 10 hours... it's annoying to have that happen to you, and it's not even the new employee's fault (it's the employer's). then the employees feel they have to get a second job they know will fill in the gap....there's really no winning. to get by, you have to get a second job, bc everyone is getting a second job and hours are becoming scarce. all bc corporate wants to give themselves a raise at the end of the quarter..... it's disgusting.",-0.7449,205

you are missing the point. why would a company support people who have not factor to the company. this is a liberal stupid idea. if they dont need you for the hours they dont put you on the pay. everything they are taking about is a way to lose your job. trust me i MA passes a law said i had to give all my employees the same amount of hours... the people who could not do the shifts i needed. 5 hour shift does not cost a company as much money. 8 hour shift cost more per hour with breaks and other laws that need to be followed that are time and money consuming. im lucky in the field i am in most of the laws do not apply to me but the ones that do cost people jobs. min wage increases and laws saying i cant increase the medical bills or fines on false 911 calls for medical emergency sucks. i end up firing the people who dont meet the pay charts and hiring new ones.
