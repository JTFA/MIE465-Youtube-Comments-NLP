"+Master Corey Blu-Ray Channel No they didn't. This was never a diss record, let alone a Nicki diss record. That's what people don't understand when it comes to Hip Hop battles. These ladies will flat out say your name if they're going to diss you. You will know if Kim and Remy are talking about you, because they will say your name. They have no need for subliminals.",-0.7906,77

"Remy second verse was fire which the delivery was so different from the first verse, leads me to believe that she might have had some help writing it, again!!! But the rest of the song is trash. The hook is fire but let’s please talk & think about something else other than Nicki Minaj. Let’s not wrap our whole career around her, it shows weakness! Name dropping or not, we know who your talking about. Also we have the 2 biggest nicki haters on 1 song. It was only a matter of time. “Bitches (plural) ain’t humble enough” is that a shot at cardi too? Why are y’all trying to cut off your own people’s head? They NY also! Just because Nicki call herself Queen? Yo, her pockets, sales, time in the game & coming from the heart of rap, I think she earned the right so pass the Crown. Remy Is still the lyrical queen for the moment, which is a different lane. So stop trying to prove yourself! Kim this hook is the best thing we heard from you in forever, so just be humble and happy that you have radio spin again. If this was just a song or to someone other than your own people, Kim may have not been Mumbling with auto tune. Which was really ass! “why hop in some beef when you can just hop in a Porsche” Cardi said it best 💯",0.5898,286
