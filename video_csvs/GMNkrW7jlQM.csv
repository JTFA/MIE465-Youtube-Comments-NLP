Given all that, recent events where the FBI exposed its bias in protecting Hillary and thwarting Trump may have more meaning for you. But if you think there is no proof and that the GOP has to present it if there were, then maybe you should look elsewhere for info because you don't seem to know what happened or how things work. 
All that aside, SNL is going to be looking pretty ugly in reruns. I recall the third cast, who were awful and forgettable to begin with, spending good comedy time whining about Reagan being elected.

"Roy Moore has been accused of being a sex offender with under-age teenagers (technically not pedophilia but still illegal). That doesn't make him guilty, and many voters were skeptical of the timing of the accusations since he has been in politics for decades without being accused. Of course he could very well be guilty. 

He was accused after winning the Republican primary, but before the final election, meaning that his accusers waited until the only viable alternative to Roy Moore was a Democrat before making their accusations. They didn't accuse him when he was running against other Republicans who would easily have beaten Doug Jones had one of them beaten Moore in the primary. 

It smacks of political assassination versus legitimate grievances as real victims of sexual misconduct rarely wait until the politically perfect moment to launch their accusations. My guess is that the people deciding when the accusations were to be made were politicians, not the alleged victims.

The day of the election, automated phone calls were sent out suggesting people write in the name of a different candidate besides Roy Moore. The phone call was made with a recording of Alabama Senator Richard Shelby suggesting that people might do that very thing, but I doubt Shelby had anything to do with that phone call as it was a comment he made during an interview well before election day and there was no ""My name is Richard Shelby and I approve of this message."" in the recording. The way the phone call was structured would have made the average listener assume it came from Richard Shelby, a much respected figure in Alabama politics among Republican voters. 

The unprecedented number of write-in votes by Republican voters wasn't enough to get any Republican besides Moore elected, but it was enough to insure that Moore lost.

Just because dirty politics gets you the election results you like, it doesn't make it okay.",-0.9725,346

“There were no female directors nominated for a Golden Globe this year. It’s a snub women in Hollywood are calling the least of our problems.” Of course assault is more important. But this was like hearing a man tell me ‘shut up about us men not giving you women accolades as directors.Don’t you know your bigger problem is the way we assault you?’ We want both problems fixed! What about the OBVIOUS connection between the two issues? Try again SNL.,-0.9413,95
