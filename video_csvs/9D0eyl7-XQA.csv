Heck no! at most they might harm a few individual creatures, because they may need to bring them to the surface and observe, test, or dissect them to learn more about them and how they work, and how their ecosystems work. This knowledge can help us better protect the greater whole of sea life from real threats to it's existance, like pollution, oil spills, ocean acidification caused by climate change, etc. The scientists here are on the side of  protecting and learning about all this life, it's fossil fuel companies and other industry that don't care how their actions affect and harm the world around them.",-0.7813,148
