One of my least favorite movies I've ever seen. So now I'm not so hype about this movie either. But this studio did put out ""It Comes At Night"" and ""Green Room"" and I kinda liked both of those.

"THEORY TIME! I don't see the  daughter in the funeral scene, only the service in church. I think she dies and it's her burial, not the grandma's. I think people are glossing over the two shots of the brother and sister in the car, then the miniature model of that same shot, except of the daughter hanging out of the window of the car. Seems curious to me that the mom would make that into a miniature model. There is also a sound effect of a car speeding, and the glares at the end look like the reflection of a car's headlights. I think these things have more to do with the story than is being let on. I have a feeling the girl is/was special and the brother had something to do with her dying and he's being haunted by the grandma. Not sure what this has to do with hereditary traits, but it's fun to guess! Can't wait to see it! üòä",0.826,182

This is funny. The Witch had all the same quotes from various sources about how great it was. Then RT had the credit reviews score. And they and those quotes said it was amazing. Then people went to see it and thought what I thought. It was the most boring horror movie probably even made. Same type of trailer as The Witch. Same unreliable sources giving quotes of it being good. Probably gonna be loved by critics too. But hated by us the people. I think I'll wait for this one on Netflix.,0.6837,104

The problem with a lot of A24 movies is poor marketing. The Witch was more of a dark fairytale/folklore and not a typical horror but the trailer didn't really sell that, trailer made it look more like a natural horror film.
