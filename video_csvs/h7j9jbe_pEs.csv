"Dear Friends Jesus Christ has a perfect plan for your life. NEVER FORGET THAT! But it is up to you to let Him work in your life. He won't force you. He must always be invited. It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your active pursuit of Him more than anything else in your life, and in doing so NO ONE to Him is more desirable than YOU! He so eagerly wants you to come to that realization dear one. He truly does. This is your starting point with our loving Creator that will last for all eternity. May God bless you in the MIGHTY name of Jesus Christ our Savior. John 3:16 ❤️❤️❤️",0.9835,143

They sell Selenite carved into unicorn horn things.  I wonder if you could use the selfie light to make a glowing horn display?  Perhaps in a shadow box or glass jewelry box?  I wonder if you could mount it to an led flashlight and diy it to look cute.  Like a Goddammed unicorn crystal light sabre!  Ok I rly want to do it now!  :D <3,0.9096,72

"This is beyond cool!  Could you guys do the moon lamp idea with the selfie light?  Similar to that, you could also take an old globe and drill holes at the places you have traveled or want to travel and the light will shine through.  Or, you could use a spherical base like a globe, paint it navy or black, and cut out constellations from it as a star projector of sorts.  I’m not sure if that would work but it sounds possible.",0.205,94

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
