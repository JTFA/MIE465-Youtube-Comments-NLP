"Much depends on how your cables are configured. As I said in the talk, solid gauge wires  can actually reduce strain on connectors in vertical settings because they are self-supporting. Use judgement to make such decisions on a case by case basis. As to cracking, if your stripping tools or procedures are nicking the wire, then thatâ€™s your problem, not the wire. Use good tools. If you terminate thousands of solid wire ends, as I do, a thermal wire stripper is a good investment, and makes nicking not just rare but physically impossible. As always, different strokes for different folks...",0.3716,117
"Solid wire applies pressure to SMT connectors and break them off the PCB. They crack at the point where they were nicked with the stripping tool. Solid has its place, but I rarely use it.",0.0,39

This was definitely one of my favorite talks that I got to see in person <3,0.8225,16
"While I would definitely argue that both varieties are ""True"" musical instruments, you're not wrong that there's something special about mechanical action organs. in the US, we built them well into the 19th century, and even a handful later on before the days of mass production. Nowadays, mechanical action is making a comeback, and many new high dollar instruments are being built that way. I never scratch-built a mechanical action organ, but I worked on a fair few, and appreciate them. Cheers!",0.9357,96
