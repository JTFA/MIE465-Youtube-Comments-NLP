"Also, it's cool to generalize all Southerners as inbred. Yet, statistically incest takes place just about as often in the North and the West, and everywhere. The only really appreciable cluster occurred hundreds of years ago among the rich, as they used to inbreed like rabbits to keep their money in the family. Before that you'd have to go back hundreds of thousands of years where if your tribe didn't interact with other tribes, then those you mated with would be cousins or more closely related. Funny, isn't it, how cutting down Southerners with taunts of inbreeding is kewl, but just mentioning, say, Jewish folks in the way I'm mentioning them in this sentence is tantamount to threatening to being anti-Semitic, which is verboten, and the furthest thing from my mind. 

Bottom line: people who cut down Southerners should be shamed. Yes, some of us in the South eat too much butter, and we fry just about everything. For that all eaters should be educated. Unless you're a super fat pig, and you want others to respect and ogle your folds. In which case I personally won't mention your food choices and lack of exercise, and will just sidle away from you, try to get off your radar, like that. Thank you.",0.9198,242
