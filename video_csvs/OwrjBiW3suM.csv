"I am a man of science. However, I do not understand the belief and fascination that other people and scientist have with evolution. There is literally no proof or evidence to support it. There is the complexity of the cell which disproves it, by Darwin's own words. Then there was this very stupid statement in this video that we evolved to be able for a woman to carry a baby. Basically that since the baby is a foreign object, that women evolved so that they could carry or gestate their children. However, that is not how the immune system works. When a foreign object enters the body, our immune systems attack that foreign substance and destroy it. When that happens our immune system gets better at attacking that particular substance. That is why when we get sick we rarely ever get sick by the same substance. It is always a slightly altered substance that makes us sick again. Therefore, if we evolved the ability to gestate children then the human species would never have existed because women's bodies would have gotten better at destroying the newly formed baby rather than protecting it. The only way that any creature could have carried offspring, especially mammals is for mammals to have been designed not evolved. It simply cannot happen any other way, and to believe otherwise just makes you stupid. It takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does creation, as there is no scientific evidence for evolution, but there is for creation.",-0.8634,278

I work with pigs and cows. This animals tend to eat the afterbirth. It is some nutritions in it to help the sow and cow. Plus it take away much of the smell so it is harder for predators to locate the calf or piglets. Horses do this to. The pigs make a nest before girth to be alone and protected. Cows and horses want to alone so by instinct they walk away from the herd before giving birth. To protect the calf and foal and the herd from predators.

Like Olivia said, there isn't any definitive evidence that it provides any benefit to a human mother but that doesn't make it bad. A lot of people who do this do so because several other animal species will eat the placenta after birth in order to regain lost nutrients and feel that it's the natural and right things to do (not at all saying I agree with that sentiment though). This isn't necessary for humans to do but also not bad. What a silly thing for you to care so strongly about.",-0.238,131

"Yeah, I've heard about the foreign cells/immune problems theory before. It's certainly plausible with my family. My parents came from eight and nine sibling families, and my grandparents also came from large families. I was the last born of three in my family. All three of us and my parents have unique autoimmune diseases. Given that autoimmune diseases tend to run in families, it makes sense that there'd be something heritable about it, but it's clearly more complicated than the prevalence of certain genes, since the diagnoses are so different. It's also very telling that the majority of people with autoimmune disease are female, which lends credence to the fact that pregnancy might be involved.",0.7684,130
