"Battery technology has certainly improved. But batteries being incompatible between brands and even tool lines within a brand is something that really irks my potato.

Also pricing.
A DeWalt DWE576K corded circular saw would set me back about 190 euro.
A very comparable DeWalt DCS570NT, cordless, without batteries or charger, is 230 euro.
A DeWalt DCS570P2, same saw as the previous one, but with 2 18V batteries and a charger, costs 480 euro.

That's a 290 euro difference, which buys a hell of a lot of extention cord. Hell it even buys a 2kW continuous output Honda generator with cash to spare for an extention cord and petrol.

For working in my own workshop, where there's mains sockets on every wall and the ceiling, and 3 phase power available, I really don't see how I could justify the extra expense for cordless. 

If I had to buy all my powertools again and start over anew, completely disregarding my bad experience with NiCad and NiMH tools, I'd still buy corded everything all over again. Simply because corded buys so much more tool for the same money compared to cordless.",-0.9682,214

"I totally understand your reasoning and if I worked primarily out of a shop and not on the road, corded would be my #1 choice as well. $300 is not really that much over the life of a tradesman's career for the convenience of cordless. Lugging around a small generator is an option of course, like you said though I'd much rather carry a bag full of batteries than say 5 gallons of gas, mostly because of the chance of spilling in a work van.

I 100% agree about the batteries being incompatible and while adapters do exist for crossing most tools/brands and batteries they are not always up to snuff. Most of these tools are still relatively new in the world of construction so hopefully after some time we'll see some type of universal standard adopted similar to USB and most electronics. While I wouldn't go out of my way to replace all my tools at once, since you do have the convenience of working from a shop check out some of the storage systems some other YouTubers have built for their tools. Honestly if I had that luxury I would probably only have a cordless impact driver and everything else corded with some type of retractable/hanging system for power cords.

However, as an electrician it's very nice to pull up to a job site and not have to hassle/compete with framers/masons/concrete guys for the sometimes limited supply of temporary outlets set up. Something I'm personally saving up for is a new item from Dewalt, their DCB1800M3T1 is a 1800watt RMS/3600watt Peak portable power bank/battery charger. Adding 4 of their new 9.0AH Flexvolt batteries would provide me with an abundance of power and more than I would ever need for my use. Yes, pricey, but I always shop around for deals and specials and once you consider the price of gas over time it becomes an even better deal.

Something else I've just learned tonight about Dewalt, though they may not have it in Europe is their trade up program. The jist being they allow you to bring in any other brand of powertool and/or batteries and offer deep discounts on new Dewalt tools. Of course this is just incentive to get you to buy into team Dewalt's 20v line but it's something and at least in Dewalt's case their 20v line is compatible with the larger AH Flexvolt batteries. A cordless impact with a 9AH battery while a little heavy,  just keeps on going and going and going.",0.9565,466

"I've done a little research into this, many experts agree that battery tech has pretty much plateaued due to science/physics. Most manufacturers are focusing more on the chemistry inside the batteries and tailoring them to specific uses ie: low-drain, low-discharge and high-drain-high-discharge. The 18650 cell size is pretty much becoming the standard by Tesla entering the game. The giant battery packs underneath Tesla's electric vehicles are just these ""pods"" with 500 or so of these 18650 sized batteries and then 10-15 of the pods placed in a big, protective case that bolts to the bottom of the car.
I guess it can kinda be compared to computers and CPU's in the early 2000s. Every manufacturer was advertising increments of 100-200MHz they all hit a wall around 3.5-4.5GHz. These days you don't see increased speeds being a selling point. They have moved onto other features to stand out.

"The FlexVolt circular saw definitely has good specs and going by YT videos it's almost able to keep up with a Skil 77, which is impressive for sure. Except that Skilsaw is a good step down in power from what I'm used to.  

And again, according to YT videos the Flexvolt is about $100 US more expensive than the Skilsaw. Though for a framer that might still very much be worth it. 
Over here in Europe DeWalt Flexvolt is basically priced like corded Hilti, Festool and Fein. Which is very stiff competition to go up against. And in my case, where dust collection is a requirement for the job, any circular saw that puts itself in Festool price ranges is probably going to lose due to the amazing dust collection on the Festool.

"Which Black and Decker brushless impact driver was rebranded as DeWalt? 

Stanley Black and Decker is the parent company that makes DeWalt, but in no way is DeWalt a rebranded version of the Black and Decker line. Some of the Black and Decker line is a rebranded Craftsman tool. Also owned by Stanley Black and Decker.",-0.4215,61
"While fanboys of brand certainly exist, I find when I'm talking to others on job sites most would use any brand that gets the job done. Most however do say that they have X brand but Y brand makes a specific tool they would like that X brand does not. They settle/make due because the thought of buying into another line is not an attractive option for 1 or 2 tools that their brand doesn't have. This is my dilemma now, Milwaukee makes a small 12volt SDS drill I would love for the occasional anchors I have to set in concrete. I just really do not want to buy into or carry around another set of battery/tool combos.",0.7061,129

"Yeah, I primarily work out of a workshop. The machinery needed to make furniture isn't that mobile to begin with. And when I do have to install things in a home, I usually work in homes where people already live, or which are days from being moved in to.

So having power at hand is never much of an issue for me. I'd rather spend the extra 300 on a saw on Festool for their amazing dust collection. And for that same reason I need a proper shopvac, again something which isn't readily available as a cordless unit.
And since I have to deal with a vacuum and the hoses that go with that, there is no real benefit to having a cordless tool.

But like I said, I can completely see why a framer would want a cordless saw to trim a 2x4 rather than schlepp about with cables and all that jazz. Or in your case when you're fitting conduit, I can totally see the benefits of a cordless drill.

I have a cordless screwdriver. Not even an impact driver, just a very simple driver. So far my little Bosch PSR7,2LI has served me very well. The only real concern I have about it, is that Bosch doesn't make it anymore, so when the internal battery dies, it's anyone's guess whether or not I can still get parts to fix it.",0.9542,259
