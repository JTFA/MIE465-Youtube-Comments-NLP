"Seriously?? This made me really question the American society. So many people haven't ever held a baby? Especially a 49 yr old! Where I come from there would barely be anyone who hasn't held a baby. Babies at a gathering are an excuse for everyone to hold and play with them! And eventually also, to give rest to the mom. Are we becoming machines? Is our excessive fascination for robots not just about curiosity. Have we started resembling or aspiring to be like them? Not investing much of emotions, limited or no deep bonds with people, looking out just for self, ...",0.7306,117
