"1.) This is the Internet. I could claim I'm the head of the CIA and you couldn't rebut that. Also, you running a company doesn't even mean anything in the context of the discussion we're having. It's completely irrelevant!

2.) I don't give a flying fuck about the little differences regarding technological intricacies. I give a fuck about the dangerous possibilities that can arise from having an always listening entity in your house that's connected with the internet. If you and all the other sheep don't see a problem with that, then you deserve to be monitored. If you seriously don't think the NSA records everything you say on devices like the Amazon Echo, then you are simply blissfully unaware of the harsh realities we live in. Even if it's technically not wiretapping, I think you do possess the mental capacity to understand what I mean in correlation to the altercation we're having regarding the topic at hand.",0.7311,175

You don't know how the technology works. There has to be a way for the NSA to actually tap alexa, there isn't. NSA recorded phone calls through batching, not tapping. It's not a technological intricacy, it's a huge fucking difference all together and a completely different thing compared to tapping. They can't record your speech when there's nothing to record it, they saved phone calls in batches, how hard is that to explain to you? I guess a lot since you're too stupid to understand how the NSA phone calls worked and the difference between wire tapping dip shit.
