Casey Simon   i agree with everything you said  but vonbraun got his liquid fuel rocket engine  ideas from Robert Goddard who was testing liquid fueled rockets  beginning in the 1920s .And the 5 F1 engines on the saturnV were built by rocketdyne first tested in the 50s,0.1901,48
"Casey Simon Actually, Russian rocket engines are better. Higher thrust and efficiency, the Atlas uses an engine design based off the NK33 engine originally designed for the N1 moon rocket. Most modern US rocket engines are based off Russian engines. Had we kept developing and improving the Apollo and Saturn designs instead of the shuttle, things would be different. As cool as the shuttle was, it was a flawed design that set our space program back. Von Braun had designs and plans to continue Apollo Saturn to the moon and beyond, perhaps we could have been to Mars by now.",0.9206,111

David Farris sure it was sure it was.  So vonbraun sat at NASA with his thumb up his ass? The Saturn 5 wasn't copied vonbraun invented it. And your claim the shuttle was flawed doesn't wash either with over 250+ launches only two were lost. On the other hand the n1 rocket constantly blew up so why would America copy it.  On the shuttle there was no flaw where as the Russia buran flew once then it was abandoned and later found in a warehouse in the desert. If you listen to Russian trolls they also claim they invented  time travel and gravity.  The falcon rocket launched today did not use any Russian engines and the international space community verifies it's engines thrust is the most powerful rocket engine to date.  The n1 had 36 engines the Saturn 5 only 7 engines 5 on the first stage one on the 2nd stage and one on the 3rd stage. Your claims that America copied the Russian engine rd180 is absolutely absurd and your claim of the shuttle is even more prosperous bc the launch numbers alone dispute your claim. Project paper clip after ww2 vonbraun along With his team was brought to the US so how could America copy Russian engines when vonbraun was the father of rocket technology and designed and built the Saturn 5 rocket in the united states. I'm surprised that you didn't claim today's launch was faked like the moon landings. O yea America is going back to the moon and ofcourse will rub Russia's nose in it that America actually did land on the moon and then now Mars is with in reach. Now if your claim that the flaw of the shuttle is because it cannot land on the moon that's not really a flaw it was purpose built to put satellites in space as per Reagan's starwars program in the 80s. But hey if it makes you feel better thinking America copied Russian engines go for it.,0.9335,349

"When I was born man had not left the earth and now private citizens are planning to populate the stars. Those who believe private investment in things that are important is never going to happen. This just shows that technology can move forward and still keep profit in mind for thr future. Private industry can do the many of the same things NASA does at a reduced cost, and can do things NASA wouldn't attempt on its best day. Can you see NASA launching a Tesla? 

This can be more exciting than even Apollo, so those of you under 50 who have no idea what Apollo was just pay attention. History is being made all around you so don't blink or you'll miss it.",0.8479,133

chandlerh2 I just looked up your point and you are correct. Dammit Jim I'm not a rocket scientist. ðŸ˜‚  I also do know jack parsons a known satanist perfected solid fuel rocket engines by using the pentagram star in the fuel layout and jpl once stood for Jack parsons laboratory not jet propulsion labs as it is now. Though on rocket engines as with say nightvision devices there is only one way to make it function by use of a micro channel plate a tube and photo cathode. Rocket engines are the same way can only follow a certain criteria I think.,0.7506,108
