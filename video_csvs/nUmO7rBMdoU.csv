"For those wondering why we stopped having those awesome pockets: there are several reasons why, but the most titular ones are attributed to fashion and men. First: men began to fear that their wives/daughters hid secret love letters and/or money to run away from them in those pockets (keep in mind that these pockets could also be hidden under pillows and were therefore very useful for secret keeping in an era where women's privacy was non-existent, which scared The Men even more). Second: in the Regency era (think Jane Austen novels/1820s) dresses became slim and empire waisted with no practical way to access pockets, and so came along the recticules: small purses that would be carried around in hand and were therefore not private. And from then on it just went downhill. (Addition: the Victorians were the first to introduce fake/decorative pockets to women's fashion. Assholes.)",0.7131,174
