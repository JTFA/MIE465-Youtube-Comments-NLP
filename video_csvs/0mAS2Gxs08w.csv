Young's foot is stuck behind Zaza's knee and draging him along. He falls, tries to stop the fall with his arms extending but Zaza's left arm gets blocked by Westbrook's leg flying up, so he lifts his arm over Westbrook's leg when it is too late and Zaza's already coming down on Westbrook.

I'm siding with the Warriors on this one. He's a 7 footer who can barely make a layup with his HANDS. You think he can do this kind of coordinated shit with the rest of his body? This isn't Bill Lambier, this is a scrub. He doesn't mean it. At all. 

That being said, he is absolutely a liability. And the fact that he can't control himself means that he's an even WORSE liability, because there's no chance of him improving. It's not like people get MORE coordinated with age.

He could've ended Kawhi, Westbrook, and KD's (his own teammate) career.

"The New Testament Scriptures on Hell.
Wages of Sin is death. (Romans 6:23). There is a way that seems right to a man but, its end is a way to death. (Proverbs 14:12).
We are not talking about the physical death but, the Spiritual death. The second death. We earned the physical death when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden.

(The teachings of Jesus according to the Gospels). But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And who ever says to his brother, Raca! shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, You Fool! shall be in danger of Hell fire. (Matthew 5:22). If you right eye causes you to Sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of you members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Hell. (Matthew 5:29). And if your right hand causes you to Sin, cut if off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for you whole body to be cast into Hell. (Matthew 5:30).
But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 8:12). And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell. (Matthew 10:28). And you Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades: for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you. (Matthew 11:23-24). And will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 13:42). So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the wicked form among the just, and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 13:49-50). Then the king said to the servants, bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 22:13). Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of Hell? (Matthew 23:33). For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 25:29-30).
Then he will say to those on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. (Matthew 25:41). And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. (Matthew 25:46). Where their worm dies not die and the fire is not quenched. (Mark 9:48). He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.

(Mark 16:16). And I say to you , My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has power to cast into Hell: yes, I say to you, fear Him!

(Luke 12:4-5). So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom. Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. but Abraham said, son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented. And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us. Then he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment. (Luke 16:22-28).

And come forth--those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation. (John 5:29). If anyone does not abide in me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. (John 15:6).

(Apostle Peter): For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to Hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked. (For that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds). Then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, and specially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. (2 Peter 2:4-10).

Afterward destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of Eternal fire. (Jude 5-7).

And when I saw Him (Jesus), I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death. (Revelation 1:18). And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the Pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the Pit. (Revelation 9:2).
Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worship the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, He himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb (Jesus). And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. (Revelation 14: 9-11).
The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. (This is the second death). And anyone not found written in the (Book of Life) was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:13-15).
They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. The devil, which deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. (Revelation 20:9-10).
But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is (the Second Death). (Revelation 21:8).
