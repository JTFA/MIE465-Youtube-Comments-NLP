Again the words of Dave Chappell not mine. As for Robin Williams was nothing more than a crazy addict with amazing tweeker behavior. Why people where surprised when he killed himself is beyond me. He was a complete confused drug addict, meth cocaine, adderall...... Robin Williams does not matter at all. He was nothing more than a tool. He would do anything for money. Anything! No ethics what so ever. He is a whole different story. Take a look at his cocaine infested rants on any TV show. White people think this is humor.

(Daves words not mine) make him wear a dress. Sure it may seem like entertainment but to another black man it is a bit offensive. Go though the list of top black entertainers ..... all of them at one time wearing a womans dress. Yet   White actors do not to this. Matt Daimon? Jude Law? Vin Diesel? No dress....watch the interview on Opra. See what happened when Dave refused to wear the dress. Then come back and ask why are people freaking out. If the black man won't put the dress on, he won't work anymore. Tyler Perry had no problem with it, neither did Wesley Snipes or Chris Tucker the list goes on but you don't see Nicolas cage in one or any white action star for that matter.",-0.7051,209

I don't understand how people don't see that and don't understand that it's sick.
