I don't like this album for some reason idk different sound maybe?,-0.3632,13
"I enjoy this new music but they completely changed their sound. It’s definitely more mainstream friendly, I just wish they would have kept a little bit more of their old selves. I liked the lyrics better in their old stuff. I think they need to strike a better balance between being really mainstream friendly and sticking with their genuine edgier selves...because their darker stuff is who they really are.",0.9838,78

It's a shame they'll never again release songs like 'Over and Over'. I miss that raw energy and emotion they used to put into their songs. These days it's just bland generic pop punk that's made to appeal to 13 - 19 year old emo/scene kids.,-0.0258,53
"It's another day
Wanna get away from here
There's a plane out on a runway
Gonna run away from here
'Cause the rain is so terribly dull
And it bores me
Yeah, misery adores me

I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe that we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?

I'm done with small town politics
I need to make my way to where the action is
I'm done with it, so the question is
Are you coming with?
'Cause baby, if you like, I'll take you there
Imagine all the places we could go to disappear
Or we could turn the light off and go back to bed
Stare at the stars on your ceiling and pretend that we're somewhere else

I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe that we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?

We don't need a God to take a leap of faith
Listen when I say that if we don't try (that if we don't try)
Then we won't believe (then we won't believe)

I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe
That we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?

I wanna do the things that you only read about

"Same though. Their Life's Not Out To Get You sound is my favourite. Musically they sound better like that. It seems like they matured a little more in this album but the lyrics also became more generic. I really miss Ben's old raw voice too. It's too clean in the new album. Anyways, I still love the new album and have high hopes about the 4th album but I wish they stuck with the pop punk sound instead of a poppier punk.",0.9502,90
