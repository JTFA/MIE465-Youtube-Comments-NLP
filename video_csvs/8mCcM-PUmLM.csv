"I could be wrong on this but I think most people consider Siouxsie Sioux to be more of a post-punk artist. Kind of like a reaction to it a few years later since punk started a bit earlier then the 70s. The post punk bands kind of ushered in goth and the direction of the early 80s for spooky people.

"Punks weren’t angry with everything they were expressing who they were because society wasn’t understanding and so with trying to express themselves they turned towards music, with music and clothes they were able to show themselves but society being what it was turned it around to seem like a bad thing with angry people, unacceptable clothing, and every other bad thing including drugs but it wasn’t all that it was more and it wasn’t just a phase for some people it was a true lifestyle. I️ grew up with my parents being punk rockers and was around all their friends I️ got a huge understanding for the truth about punks and took on the same sort of life.",-0.6249,133
