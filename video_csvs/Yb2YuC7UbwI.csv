"@The King of Random I've been wanting to do a experiment with bottle rockets and how they react in a vacuum and I too was wondering how I could ignite the fuse without breaking the vacuum. I'm a union HVAC technician so the first thing that thought of was a hot surface igniter, they're used to light the burner in a furnace, they're also called glow rods, when a current is passed through the element it begins to glow bright orange, just figured I'd throw that out there, not as if you guys weren't aware of them anyway because I'm sure you are, keep up the great work you guys are awesome.",0.9246,120
"@The King of Random a bit off topic sort of but I was curious what you think of the Tesla roadster that was launched into space, many people are saying they believe that it was faked because the materials of the car wouldn't be able to survive being in space, what's your take on this?

"I think a lot of these wouldn't burn that well in space. When you ignite anything, it's giving off not just solid particles of smoke, but also gasses, which could influence the reaction because the container is so small. If you wanted to better test how they'd behave in space, you'd want to use a much larger chamber so that the gasses would all move away from the reaction.",0.6565,76
