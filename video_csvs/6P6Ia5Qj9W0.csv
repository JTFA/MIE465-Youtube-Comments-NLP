"+Somedude Watchintv Sorry, yeah, at this point I really can't tell which ones really just don't get it. My experience with You Tube has taught me that there are a great many ""Sheldon Cooper's"" in this world. That is to say, they lack the ability to detect sarcasm, and likely don't understand what it is at all. Beyond that, that there would be a prank performed on this sort of scale is just something that should be so obviously ridiculous. I know not to take any of that for granted though. There are always a few, or more, that will take you seriously :).",0.3862,120

Watched it on the premiere. Sadly yes. I was hoping they wouldn't go there since they did it with Han Solo in the last movie. But appearently they thought it would make for good story telling.
Basically Luke has a bad hip. And so he falls over and lands on his lightsaber when he enters the Millenium Falcon. It's a bit more dramatic than Han's death. But personally I feel like it's not a very satisfying end to his character.",-0.4971,108
