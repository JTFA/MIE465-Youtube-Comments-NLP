The one that stood out to me was the part about 'where' and 'what.' The video seems to be saying, as I recall, and by my limited understanding, ""example ASL 'where' BSL 'what,' meaning ASL 'where' W-H-E-R-E meaning BSL 'what' W-H-A-T"" and the subtitles put that same meaning into a much shorter sentence in written English, ""'Where?' in ASL is 'What?' in BSL.""",0.5122,147
"I don't think a uniform sign language can happen because languages change and adapt. A famous difference over here in Israel (at least 12 years ago when I learned basic ISL) - a place's name was based on its appearance in other cities, but in its own city, the sign was the number of the bus leading there.

I'm not deaf myself nor do I use sign language, so I'm not 100% sure about the details.

Slang does develop, too. If I were deaf and in the US I'd probably adapt the word ""Trump"" for ""stupid"" or vice versa, because that's the common opinion in my social circle and it's funny. 10 years on, if someone signs ""you're Trump"" to a Brit, they may not get it. This is one of the ways language evolves locally.

In spoken language, winter in Israel is much easier and warmer, so we don't use (and in practice, have) as many words for rain and snow as common English does.
So I don't believe a universal language CAN survive beyond conventions and other special events.

It's also sort of like all Brits changing to RP. Could be interesting but it won't happen.",0.9599,230

"It's interesting seeing how other sign languages use their hands. As an Australian, I use (rather haphazardly) Auslan. Auslan is a mostly two-handed sign language, with the right hand doing the bulk of the sign, whilst the left hand is used as more of an aide (meaning handedness is more obvious). Even fingerspelling in Auslan is two-handed. There ARE one-handed variants of signs, but they're considered improper, and informal, and are somewhat looked down upon. 

Just making a point to say this video felt odd to me, as the signing here (BSL?) used either only one hand, or used both as a major part of the sign, which is far flung from what I'm used to seeing. Odd is good though, because odd means it's new to me.",0.6542,152

"Thinking it makes life more interesting isn't a good justification for preferring to have different versions. I'd argue actually being able to more readily communicate with people from other countries and cultures is far, far more interesting, and doing so would be significantly easier if there was a shared language. This is of course with exception to the fact that having something like that is nigh impossible and, if it did exist in this moment, would ultimately have regional divergences develop over time anyway.",0.8232,91

To be fair. A HUGE percentage of conflict erupts (which leads to deaths) from verbal or written miss-communications. The reason for language being different is be course it was created in different places with no communications with other tribes/cities/countries. If the only reason we don't all speak the same language is be course it's more interesting. We are all Fools.,0.3871,71
