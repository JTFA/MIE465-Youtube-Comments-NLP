"Always good to see Chef Ortega.  Excellent episode. 👍  With that said, Ortega is indeed an incredible chef and deserves all his awards and recognition of course but not enough credit is ever given to Tracy.  She gets a mention here and there but really, she is the reason all this happened.",0.3662,58

"If you think they just sell ""rice and beans"" you've never been there.  It's gourmet Mexican food.  They are one of the few places in Houston that you can buy chiles en nogada and they do it better than anywhere else I've eaten it in the U.S.  Also, Houston is a very diverse city and it makes sense that it's not only Mexicans eating there, although I don't think I've been there when there hasn't been someone speaking Spanish with a Mexican accent ordering food.",0.4404,95
"It's a great story, but when you see more white customers than Latinos it's telling of how far removed from association of its roots it's become. Rice and beans are the cheapest thing to buy and every mexican restaurant accompanies it along something else and they want to charge 12 to 15 a plate. Fuck off.",-0.4118,60

"Sally Vee  as far as I know that is completely inaccurate, yes the Portuguese do have another name for it. But that style of cured sausage has been around since Roman times, anyway the pepper which is used in chorizo originates from Caceres and the ""original"" place of birth of chorizo is said to be Galicia, which could be misunderstood as Portugal to some people since it's so close. 
I am not trying to be mean or anything, I just feel very protective about Spanish food culture",0.1477,95
