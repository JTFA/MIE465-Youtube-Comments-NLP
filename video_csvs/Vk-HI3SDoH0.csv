"Except the studies you are referencing were done on very small sample sizes and are FAR from conclusive. Due to the abnormally high suicide rate in post op trans people we should conduct MUCH MORE research before pushing these concepts through mass media. Forcing science before it's ready always ends badly, just ask the lobotomy, which had plenty of studies showing how it would ease suffering for the mentally ill (Medical journals praised its use). I'm not saying discriminate against anyone or ignore science, what I am saying is that Science is a great tool that requires time to find the truth, due to the relative recency of the research into trans matters we really don't have anything conclusive yet and could be putting peoples lives at risk. What we should be doing is pouring all this media money into more studies rather than activism.",-0.5267,156

"Idiotic is a society that bases itself solely on emotions rather than scientific research.There are plenty of studies that show that starting hormone treatment during puberty actually decreases the risk of mental issues in adulthood for transgender people. 

One of the many that pop in my mind, conducted by Annelou L.C. de Vries Et al. and called ""Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment"", involving more than 50  transgender Dutch youth, concluded that delaying puberty for had a significant positive effect on their health, compared to their transgender peer who didn't undergo the same treatment early on:

""By young adulthood, anxiety, emotional distress and body image concerns were no more prevalent among the transgender group than among the general public, the researchers determined. Also, quality of life and happiness levels were on par with their peers, gender dysmorphia was no longer an issue, and no patients expressed regret about the transition process, including puberty delay.""

The risk of basing legislation of emotions is that we are actually hurting these people, not making them better. More search is always needed, but the prospects support this treatment, not the contrary. And i applaud their parents, because despite their believes, they are doing what is best for their children!",0.905,240
