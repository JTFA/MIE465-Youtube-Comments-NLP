  Nobody that cares about basketball thinks Melo was ever on the same level as Lebron. Go spout off empty statistics to some casual fan that will be impressed by your knowledge.
  Didn't ROY go to Dwayne Wade who also did everything but pass or play above the rim at Lebron's level? How dare you even mention Melo in the same breath. Wade got MVP's stolen from him by Steve Nash and Kobe, literally carrying his team , solo. While Melo was constantly losing playoffs, scoring no points because teams actually play defense in the postseason and he's an empty seat otherwise.

  Secondly, I don't give a fuck how many votes Wade got. Fans that actually watched the games back then knew he should have got those two MVP's and he was contributing in all phases of the game, day one, as a rookie, while YOUR boy Melo never once played half the game(defense) for a full shift. let alone a whole game.

  I'm not going to mention it and then not give a higher rank because of it. It matters. There is always the asterisk. From Lebron being 18 to Kurt Warner being 30, it is always mentioned in the conversation.
  And again, Lebron is #1 not because of stats but because he was doing everything day 1. Keep naming players and I'll keep shooting them down based on the giant holes in their games that Lebron was at least mediocre at (jump shot %)if not already elite(passing, defending, athleticism).

I agree that Simmons doesn't really play similar to Hill. The main comparison with both is that they had a good all-around game. 

But Grant Hill was by far a more polished scorer than Simmons. Ben is obvious bigger, but I don't know if I would say he is more athletic than a young Grant Hill.

 Before the injuries, Hill was a very explosive and dynamic athlete. Ben is more similar to Magic because I believe he is a true point-guard, not a forward pretending to be a PG. 

He is stronger and more explosive than young Magic, but I feel Magic had much more flair and a better court vision, even though Simmons has already shown great awareness and feel for the game.",0.9867,172

I didn't think Lebron won ROY that year because I have 0 respect for those awards. The MVP nor ROY never goes to players that should get it. I never stated what years I thought Wade should get the MVP, just the players that stole it. You, therefore must have researched it after I mentioned it. You just Trolled yourself.
  I don't care what 'analysts' like Steven A. Smith said about Melo because they, like you, watched basketball for 30 years and still don't know anything about basketball. The other, majority of analysts who actually see what they are looking at, all knew Melo was a bum from day one. They would stay pleasant but never once seriously considered him for any award ever. Dwayne Wade and Especially Lebron were obviously HoF from day one, BECAUSE THEY DO EVERYTHING. Not just shoot weak J's that would be contested in the playoffs.
  I actually have Wilt listed as the greatest player of all time. The problem with giving him ROY is that there was no older generation of big men when he came in, to compete with him. When the league started drafting players that were closer to his size and talent(Kareem Abdul Jabar) is where he proved to be the greatest. No one remembers that Wilt blocked the Sky Hook regularly or that he was old and slow when he dominated the Championship series against Lew Alcindor.
  Name the player that you keep alluding to, so I can shoot holes in his game. I bet you won't because you know by now that I don't give a flying fck about your empty stats.

And everybody knows that your biggest improvements are usually seen at the beginning of the season as a result of offseason training. 

Aside from this, Magic has probably won this argument with relative ease. Not many players can say they led a championship team as a rookie, and winning a Finals MVP for it too.

Answer: no, he's not the best all-around rookie. He's an incredible player from the get-go, like many other have been before him. Hope he stays healthy and becomes the star, or superstar, he's meant to be.",0.8039,121
