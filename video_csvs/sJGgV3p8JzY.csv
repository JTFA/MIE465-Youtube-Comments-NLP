"Fresh laid concrete
Melodies blowing
Don't care where we're going
But the day is wasting
Just keep moving
And take it all in

The rumble of voices are the bass to our song
The horns are just on the beat
Honkin' along
Let's be the harmony
But no note is wrong

And let's take the city
And make it our song
Our song
Our song
Let's take the city
And make it our song

Pencil tapping
Feet speed walking
Cars just driving
Daydream gazing
Just keep moving
And take it all in

The rumble of voices are the bass to our song
The horns are just on the beat
Honkin' along
Let's be the harmony
But no note is wrong

And let's take the city
And make it our song
Our song
Our song
Let's take the city
And make it our song

Everything going on around you
Just close your eyes and disconnect for a moment or two
And hear

The rumble of voices are the bass to our song
The horns are just on the beat
Honkin' along
We'll be the harmony
But no note is wrong

And let's take the city
And make it our song
Our song
Our song
Let's take the city
And make it our song
