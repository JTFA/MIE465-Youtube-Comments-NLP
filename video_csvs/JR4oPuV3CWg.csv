"*_THANK YOU_* for sharing the thing about the rice. I work in a phone repair shop and _literally_ the only thing putting your phone in rice does is get fucking rice stuck in your headphone jack/speaker port/charge port. If anything, it actually just replaces the water that's already in your phone with _starch_ which is *_WAY_* worse for the motherboard because of all the impurities in it.

Honestly, (and this isn't a shameless plug, lol) the best thing you can do for a water damaged phone is *NOT TURN IT ON* and bring it to somebody who knows what they're doing as soon as humanly possible. If they open the phone, dry it really well with a clean towel, and leave open under a heat lamp overnight it'll be good as new 99 times out of 100.

(PS. - An interesting tidbit: If you put your phone in 100% sterilized water it should hypothetically work just fine, even while submerged! It's actually the _impurities_ in normal tap water/salt water, and the added effect of the corrosion of the metal on the motherboard _because_ of the water, that screws up your phone. Not the water itself! :D)",0.9313,232

"1. toothpaste high in fluoride works as dehydration to your skin (dries the oils in your skin just like pimple cream, result is not same for all but IS effective) 
2. the small amount of ammonia in urine does sooth slightly but only IF vinegar is not available at the time 
3. heat from a lamp or fan can cause the water to get deeper into the circuits and corrode connections within the phone, rice absorbs moisture (maybe not as well as some other things) but is a common household item that works
4. you are right, dont use candles to clean your ear, most effective way of cleaning is a few drops of hydrogen peroxide which will dissolve and loosen the wax in your ear making it extremely easy to clean/rinse out, you will feel and hear a bubbling sound and that means its working! (2-3 drops per ear, UP TO 10 minutes each, do not apply more than 3 times a day)",0.9451,184

"Best method I have tried for cleaning out your ears (or treating swimmer's ear)... 50% heated water, 50% rubbing alcohol.  Place cold (room temperature) alcohol in a small glass (a shot glass filled less than halfway works well).  Heat the water in a microwave in a separate container, then add an amount equal to the alcohol in the glass.  This should result in the mixture being warm but not hot... test by dribbling a bit on the back of your hand or your wrist (NEVER PUT THE MIXTURE IN YOUR EAR WITHOUT TESTING THE TEMPERATURE FIRST).  If the temperature is suitable and not uncomfortably hot to your hand, it's safe to pour it in your ear, which you should have someone help you do (you can also use an eyedropper).  Hold the mixture in your ear for 20 or 30 seconds, then turn your head so it can drain out.  Repeat as often as is necessary.  It will almost always releave the clogged sensation you often get with swimmer's ear (the heat will melt away the ear wax and the alcohol will disinfect).  In fact, it's worked 100% of the time whenever I have had to do it.

No matter how much anyone tries to convince you to substitute hydrogen peroxide for the alcohol... NEVER PUT HYDROGEN PEROXIDE in your ear or on any wound.  Hydrogen peroxide actually damages human tissue.  Instead of disinfecting a wound or swimmer's ear, you're potentially making the infection worse by making the wound or irritation worse.",0.6354,289

I know it costs money but you really aren't helping anything by letting it dry. The people that just let it dry after the device has been fully submerged usually come in for other issue a month or so later, and we find that the corrosion has caused massive issues with chips making the repair cost as much as the phone.

"I do ear candling. I don‚Äôt pretend to know why it works but it does. I got my first session while in training at massage School. It is unbelievable soothing and calming. In 13 yrs every person has fallen asleep. I have burned a candle side by side with one in an ear. The one bit in the ear did not have build up. I guess the build up to be lymph. The medical community does not understand lymph or facia very well or it true roles in the body. I have had desperate people come to me with ear issues if ringing, pressure, stuffiness, and itching after going to numerous specialists. I too have went to Drs and had many tests done to no avail. I‚Äôm, and my clients are too, told it‚Äôs psychosomatic. One, professionally done, ear candling solves these issues that modern medicine can‚Äôt even find. I do one twice a year on my family to keep our ear, canals and sinuses clear with a lymphatic massage does simultaneously. We never get respiratory issues at all now. EVERY stinking year we all got colds, sinus infections, strep, or some jazz. I became a massage therapist 12 yrs ago and began changing our lives. It‚Äôs been 7 yrs since anyone was sick in my house and we all work in the public. Public school, public holistic arts center and my husband works at a state facility open to the public.

"Infections can be on the other side of your eardrum or even in your Eustachian tubes.

That said, hydrogen peroxide definitely does clean out your ears.  The problem is it also kills a few layers of skin and is very, very harsh.  It *can* cause damage (though it normally doesn't).  Basically, if you're desperate and want to use it, use it sparingly.  Do not use it often or you'll make yourself more open to infection.  

Also make sure you're using just the regular drug-store hydrogen peroxide (3% solution) that has been pre-diluted to a safe level, don't use the 35% or higher stuff!  

As an experiment, pour some hydrogen peroxide on your fingers and let it sit until the fizzing stops.  That is what it is doing inside your ears.  (Also, I'm not responsible for damage to your skin).",-0.884,166

"The phone thing started with the revelation that iPhones have a sensor in them that detects how much moisture it's been exposed to. Normally, it's triggered if the iPhone has been rained on or dunked, and doing so would void the warranty.

The problem (the story goes) was that some places (like Texas or Louisiana) are sometimes so humid that it triggers the sensor (and still voids the warranty!) even _without_ rain or dunking. And a workaround was to pack the phone in _salt_ to reverse the gauge. It doesn't fix whatever else is wrong with you phone, but at least reduces the chances that your iWarranty is voided by swampy air.

I'm not sure if that sensor still exists in i6 or later phones, or how Apple deals with it, but this is where the stories started about packing your electronics in desiccants. Given that I overworked an HP laptop, and the warranty was voided by a _detected droplet of tea_ (that is, a nearby tea-spill) there is certainly a history of tech companies being difficult with their warranties, especially when it comes to liquids.

These days, some electronics (my phone, a SONY) _are_ intentionally waterproofed so as to remove the question. I think a line of i7s may be waterproof as well. It's about time.

"Toothpaste is an effective treatment for one off spots due to it's antibacterial qualities and it's ability to absorb oil

Peeing on Jellyfish stings works to an extent, it's what to do if there's no running water around, jellyfish stings are alkaline in nature and pee should maintain a neutral PH helping to relive the alkaline burn.

Covering your phone with rice works as it's dry and absorbs water (Even kitty litter was better? You mean that thing that is literally designed to absorb liquids?) Rice is the go to as most people have it in their house, more people than have kitty litter.

* like the hopi ear-candles are not fucking regular candles, thick wax ones, they're specifically made, hollow,and _that's_ what causes the pressure vacuum.
many places worldwide use this therapy.

* the rice thing sounds dubious af.
 once I was sitting by a canal bank with a mate in t summer, and dropped my nokia fone into it.
two guys who were drinking nearby rescued it for me, n I got them a six-pack of cider (tinnies).
mind u, this was not a smarrfone, an old skool nokia, when t batry would last for days.
I got it home , took it apart, stuffed toilet roll into every gap I could see,and left it on t radiator,turning it every few hours.
it resuscitated nicely, though t ringtone was a bit dwanky,I still have the fone, but don't use it.

* since people don't usually carry baking soda or vinegar to the beach with them, they panic n think piss, sometimes (everyone's piss is different,ph, etc) may be more alkaline and work.
best thing to do us get out of the water and to a hospital asap.
though pissing oneself in fear in that situation is perfectly acceptable (or wanting to piss _on!_ the cunting jellyfish,ugh.).

* and the *_biggest load of bollocks_* ,
is the toothpaste trick,
it _works_ (and well,too!), that's been touted as an ""insider modelling beauty tip"", since the frigging _nineties_ .
plain white toothpaste,smeared just around the zit, acts as a face-mask would, drawing the spot to the surface where it can be squeezed and/or treated with other remedies.
using a good concealer with anti-zit properties works well, but if you pop it, don't slather make up on it, clean it with soap n water, and antibacterial cleanser or wipes, then dab it dry with bog-roll, and if there's still fluid seeping out, tear a small bit off the toilet roll,and put it onto the spot, like you would for a shaving cut.
when removing, use warm water as tearing it off will just re-open the sore area.

this is first-hand advice, and it works, also for others I know both in film/stage and other such industries.
so they can look faaabulous on the catwalk, or a nefarious trial..
..though one could illicit sympathy from the jury by pointing outvssid zit saying that it's scurvy,
because the institution hasn't been providing enough fresh food.
in which the jury _might(?)_ respond emphatically.
just _wash off_ the toothpaste, or they'll laugh, hey.",0.9637,519
