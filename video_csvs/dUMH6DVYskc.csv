"Sureshort cure Steve Jobs's biological parents were Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble. His adoptive parents were Paul Jobs and Clara Hagopian.

His biological father, Abdulfattah ""John"" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. March 15, 1931), grew up in Homs, Syria and was born into an Arab Muslim household.[10] Jandali is the son of a self-made millionaire who did not go to college and a mother who was a traditional housewife.[10] While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities.[10] Although Jandali initially wanted to study law, he eventually decided to study economics and political science.[10] He pursued a PhD in the latter subject at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble (b. August 1, 1932), a Catholic of Swiss and German descent, who grew up on a farm in Wisconsin.[11][10][12] As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.[13] Jobs's full biological sister (Mona Simpson), notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: ""it wasn't that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a Muslim. But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it's not that unusual.""[13] Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's official biographer, additionally states that Schieble's father ""threatened to cut Joanne off completely"" if she continued the relationship.[11]

Jobs's adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs (1922–1993), grew up in a Calvinist household,[14] the son of an ""alcoholic and sometimes abusive"" father.[11] The family lived on a farm in Germantown, Wisconsin.[11][14] Paul bore an ostensible resemblance to James Dean; he had tattoos, dropped out of high school, and traveled around the Midwest for several years during the 1930s looking for work.[11][14] He eventually joined the United States Coast Guard as an engine-room machinist.[14] After World War II, Paul Jobs decided to leave the Coast Guard when his ship docked in San Francisco.[14] He made a bet that he would find his wife in San Francisco and promptly went on a blind date with Clara Hagopian (1924–1986). They were engaged ten days later and married in 1946.[11] Clara, the daughter of Armenian immigrants, grew up in San Francisco and had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war. After a series of moves, Paul and Clara settled in San Francisco's Sunset District in 1952.[11] As a hobby, Paul Jobs rebuilt cars, but his career was as a ""repo man"", which suited his ""aggressive, tough personality.""[14] Meanwhile, their attempts to start a family were halted after Clara had an ectopic pregnancy, leading them to consider adoption in 1955.[11]",-0.9688,606

"This video fails to clarify: 

The Son must have at one point or another, input the PASSCODE into the iPhone, while obviously looking at it, allowing the iPhone to LEARN about both of their faces....thats the major part of this video that is missing. 

They did not acknowledge, nor did they do a factory reset, setup the iPhone using the mom's face for Face ID and then have each try without ever inputting the Passcode on video. 

That would define the result of FaceID at work.",-0.6124,97
