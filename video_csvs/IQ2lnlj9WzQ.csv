"She's a great drummer. Lovely start - then, so sad, a useless ad executive decides ""more is better"". 

What a waste of talent - and of ""funding circle's"" money.

Overpaid executives and bureaucrats are the ugly face of capitalism. The over-reliance on so-called executives is the scary bit here.

Listen to ""Inna Gadda Da Vida"" and Rare Earth's ""Get Ready"" for drumming superlatives. Or Gene Krupa and others.

What a bunch of ....",-0.2754,114
