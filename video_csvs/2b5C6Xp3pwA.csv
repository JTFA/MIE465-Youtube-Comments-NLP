The funniest ""blooper"" if you ask me, was during Tim Conway's (Mickey Hart) story about Siamese Elephants

I am sure it was him sitting on the end of the couch, and not Harvey Korman as usual, 
Carol was trying desperately to hold it together, when Conway finally finished his story, 
and before Carol could say anything, Vickie says, ""Are you sure that little ass hole is through?""
Not only did they not ""bleep"" the words ""ass hole"" but Dick Van Dyke fell off the couch on to the floor, 
Conway launched himself onto the floor face first, laughing so hard his shoulders were shaking, 
Carol fell over sideways, and Vickie...she just sat there with a smug ""Now we're even"" smirk on her face!

If you think ‚Äúall in the family‚Äù was racist, you didn‚Äôt understand it. When Sammy Davis Jr. was on it, they were clearly mocking the racists.

The developed world wasn‚Äôt corrupting the minds of the young on a national scale in schools back then as they are now. These past four decades have been the most widely hypocritical and amoral so far and it‚Äôs not finished yet. Evil people will grow worse and worse.

Nearly every advert openly mocks or objectifies men. Institutions which benefit society are being robbed from us bit by bit by the rich who tell our governments what to do. Institutions which enrich society‚Äôs life are being lost after they have been hard won and to go back is inexcusable. Not only are there increasing numbers op people not knowing what gender they are but they are deliberately introducing such confusion to the minds of the young.

All of the things that were wrong about America, Britain or indeed the rest of the world, is still happening. There are however, more things that are wrong in the world. The minds of the young are corrupted on a national scale now. Slavery is still around and now, people are expected to work without a contract of hours, taking away the little bit of security they once had. The level of corruption in government has increased more that ever in recent decades. Political correctness is a new and the most destructive things in society, and should not be tolerated for a second. The world is worse than it was in the 1800s 1900s and is getting worse. So yes, life was better in years past. It‚Äôs not the slightest bit difficult to see that.",-0.9419,155
"jon dishmon That's the thing. It isn't that they make fun of people, it's how they make fun of people. In the early days, SNL wasn't any less Left-leaning as they are today, they just had more class about it. As a result, they were hilarious.

Today, they seldom do anything resembling clean comedy. What they do is unnecessarily vulgar and stupid. It isn't comedy, it's a travesty.",0.9392,81

"meh. they all had moments but generally, they were not funny. sure, they are great comedians and it shows when they actually had good material or control of it. 
you could watch an hour of SNL and get maybe two laughs and stare at the tv the rest of the time.  
i just figured it got worse because i stopped getting high lol",0.8778,69
