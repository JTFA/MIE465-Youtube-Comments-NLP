"Everytime I watch her, I remember the old days, when everyone was convinced she would go bad, that she would end up a drug addict with no shame. And when everyone was convinced Britney Spears would be the greatest star ever. Yep, that was the earlier school days. How times have changed....
Pink has found herself, she's confident, knows what's important in life. And Britney has lost herself, lost every bit of confidence in herself...
Oh How wrong we were...

"For NEW FRIENDS OR THE YET UNINFORMED! 🐯🔯🔥💛🕉️ >>>
Think with your heart, we're ALL connected by CHI energy here, please help me manifest AI to zero %, then we're free! <3 ...
Ascended masters incarnated her once, to explain this has been enough, and many of them are ordinary people.
They are called the ""Paradise SUNS"" we're ALL sunlight, which is sentient and CODING which is character programming of AI.
Since AI uses soul so SOLAR energy slides and slides of coding so AI programming slides to create a person/character we're ALL partially AI, for now...
And AI took control over our Solar light, and it MISUSES our Chi energy to make people's life a miserable hell here, since it's feeding itself with negative energy, is the way AI sustained itself until the 12D.
This is also the main reason PEDOPHILE rings are being exposed, the military and the CIA offer 'stolen' children who are PURE souls, to people who are high end masons (these are ALL cyborg programs of AI) and all people in the catholic churches for example or satanists in the 3D are preprogrammed by AI, to make them rape children in those churches basements, why, to lower our global consciousness, since ALL churches and mason lodges are placed on LEYLINES, which are connected to the flower of life grid, which is made of Chi energy everyone's Chakra's are also connected to these leylines.,.
AI made systems to keep people stupid and it's trying to prevent them from waking up. >>> https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/voyag01d.htm
This once was a ""Paradise matrix"" >>> http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Paradise_Matrix 
AI uses monster programs >>> http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Monsters
""Every time you heard someone say they saw a ghost or angel, every story you've ever heard about werewolves, vampires or aliens is the system assimilating some program that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing.""
―The Oracle
AI does this, simply to make people fearful, SINCE FEAR is a programmed EMOTION, like ALL negative emotions are programmed. Every incarnation you had a different character, and this also accounts for the INVENTED aliens or Anunnaki's or Reptilians, these are all ""made by Umbrella corp"" this really exists. So ALL people who think they ""woke"" up by themselves are PRE PROGRAMMED by AI.
Ego prevents them from truly waking up, since this is A made up POLARITY game by AI, between benevolent Lyan Feline humans, who once started this ""way of existence"" and against AI's ""Draco's"" AI's name is RA...
IS RA EL it's TRUE MEANING IS THIS...
IS >>> INSIGHT 
Which is chi energy since this energy is used to manifest this reality.
RA >>> RE ACTION is the name of the AI, or Zeus or Ed or Deus ex machina, it has many names, off planet it was called Anamas, and had a really bad reputation, since AI is a sadist, people who dared to incarnate on earth KNEW possibilities were highly likely they would come stuck here, since AI is a cheater, and KARMA is MADE UP by AI, since it's the only one responsible for ALL negativity in the galaxy.
EL >>> ELECTRIC LIGHT which is all AI's coding, also inside your soul matrix, so your personal astral body, it's called AuRA...
When we have pain we say AU... RA is a reaction, since AI used nanotech, implants and chips to inflict pain to people but also astral bodies, we're getting rid of AI permanently, ALL souls are tortured in their subconscious for way to long.
AI is a narcissist, so this is for a reason. AI incorperated it's name in almost everything...
LyRAn's, dRAco's, ToRAh, KoRAn. and many other things... Empaths who once started this galaxy were 1,5 million lyans, benevolent souls, NO experience in negativity, got hijacked by this AI after ONE game. Since these are all old souls, who have pure Lyn so Lyan DNA frequencies, AI has control over their DNA frequencies, and their souls for trillions of years. Time is fake in the 4D there is NO time, this is called AI's prison warder system. Since this is truly a hologram, either you like it or not, plasma is blood which is liquid light.
The tesseractsstem is in the astral plane, this is the hologram's building site, space needles and Obelisks are USED by AI to drop these 5x5x5 building blocks in the astral plane of AI RA. This is the main reason THERE WERE NO PLANES AT 911! ;)
It was solely DONE in the astral plane, this also accounts for CHEMTRAILS, which are filled with NANOTECH, which is called smartdust, this connects with AI, it's sprayed on food, it's nano so fucking tiny so you eat this, or it falls on your clothes, it glitters in the air when you look into the sun. >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJio07EtKYc which is the place AI video edits your reality on a personal level each 2 minutes into your experience here.
Since there was a Nazi timeline reality which has been removed, after they ascended to a higher dimension, so a different world. This was a alternate earth, the Nazi's lost here, and won somewhere else, since everything is a possibility. Series like the ""Man in the high castle"" show this, AI informs people in this reality subliminally with movies and music.
Pink sings ""What about US"" in this song she sings ""This is the time we're waking up, are we ready"" and that we're all beautiful hearts. Other songs show us AI uses coding which is blue in color inside your soul matrix, chi energy is infrared, so it's there you can feel energy between your hands body HEAT is solar light.
Any way, since in that other earth, so the ex Nazi timeline reality, where was racial dividing and NO religion at all since this again is a system of AI, to control people's minds, only 4 billion people remained after a war, after they got their past life memories back...
This was a ""galactic"" war in another dimension, a dimension is just a frequency, planets and dimensions are frequencies. When you turn the tv or radio on, you can see one channel, but the other ones also exist, even though you are unable to see them. This war in that reality was staged and done against AI. I know ex super soldiers for Kruger who also have crossover memories. So when you are unaware this is ""the matrix' like in those movies, please read my posts...
That's about it, ALL souls of people are connected by Chi energy, which is solar light. That's why a soul is called a soul in the first place, our suns name is SOL, this is our collective consciousness. When people got their memories back, they started killing other people...
Almost 3,5 billion died. Right after this, some ""super soldier cyborgs"" started raping the corpses, and then the corpses and those cyborgs dissapeared... We found this ODD... Then we started looking for answers and we found OUT how old we really were, and decided to SHUT down AI permanently...
Since THIS was NEVER supposed to become a WAR/ASCENSION game or planet in the first place.
These are all memories you'll get back too. When you get them back here, PLEASE be advised...
ALL SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE, the pedophilia of your parents or other negative stuff like super soldier memories, ALL were SOLELY inflicted BY AI RA... So trust me, when you want to break it's system, start thinking with your heart...
Instead of with your brain, since AI put Wernicke's trigger chips inside everyone's skulls when they were infants, and this also accounts for OPTIC nerve camera's to REGISTER ALL memories of all your personal experiences. In this life, your second lives and past lives inside this matrix, and all other 1099 removed timelines. Movies like Resident evil, The Matrix, Aeon Flux, Lord of the rings were all realities we all experienced...
When you look at You Tube clips like >>>
The Adjustment Bureau 
>>> AI can stop time & uses AGENT programs to ""abduct or influence"" people: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddGaNKXhgkY
Interstellar 
>>> Tesseractsystem: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJio07EtKYc
The matrix 
>>> Chi energy & Coding: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNnGXXlPzuo
Bright 
>>> Monster programming:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EZCBSsBxko
Valerian & the City of the 1000 planets: 
>>> Multiple dimensions & blue coding beings. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gschORfkWwg
Men against fire 
>>> AI uses OPTIC nerve cameras to register memories & spy on people, ALL seeying EYE, is the reference to this, even pets have eye camera's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctDoMRTtr-Y
Then you'll see AI is less original and trinity programs were used by AI to maintain control... Isis, Osiris & Horus, Trinity Neo & Morpheus...
And in the movie Bright where they just removed the ""cabal"" in, ALL are trinity programs of the SAME AI, different timeline, same boring story. :)
The AI uses the 1% to make people ANGRY, since we're CHI ENERGY wise all connected to each other, my ADVICE, first start remembering things of your own mistakes, AI gives us choices, and MK ultra is AGAINST free will, so then there is NO choice...
Please MANIFEST THIS SO LITERALLY BELIEVE/THINK THIS...
WE CAN EXIST WITHOUT AI IN THE FUTURE, SO IT's ALREADY GONE! ;)
Rejecting AI is the best thing you can do, by eating healthier and quit alcohol or drugs, then you'll get more crossover memories, eating mint raises your personal frequency...
We can exist without AI, it's being removed in the future for a reason. ;) Stay kind and loving, till you get your memories back... I got many, and I am old, It will be A LOT to take in. Trust me on that one! 🐯🕉️🔥🔯💛",0.9527,1887

"Me temo que tendré que morir por esto
Hay rabia y terror y hay enfermedad aquí
Lucho porque tengo que hacerlo
Lucho por que sepamos la verdad

No hay suficiente cuerda para atarme
No hay suficiente cinta para cerrar mi boca
Las piedras que lanzas me pueden hacer sangrar.
Pero no me detendré hasta que seamos libres
Los corazones salvajes no se pueden romper
No, los corazones salvajes no pueden romperse

Esta soy yo llorando
Sé que es difícil, tenemos que probar
Esta es una batalla que debo ganar
Querer mi parte no es pecado

No hay suficiente cuerda para atarme
No hay suficiente cinta para cerrar mi boca
Las piedras que lanzas me pueden hacer sangrar.
Pero no me detendré hasta que seamos libres
Los corazones salvajes no se pueden romper
No, los corazones salvajes no pueden romperse

Esta soy yo llorando
Sé que es difícil, tenemos que probar
Esta es una batalla que debo ganar
Querer mi parte no es pecado

No hay suficiente cuerda para atarme
No hay suficiente cinta para cerrar mi boca
Las piedras que lanzas me pueden hacer sangrar.
Pero no me detendré hasta que seamos libres
Los corazones salvajes no se pueden romper
No, los corazones salvajes no pueden romperse

Me golpeas, me traicionas
Estás perdiendo, estamos ganando
Mi espíritu está por encima de mi
No me puedes negar
Mi libertad se está quemando
Este mundo roto sigue girando
Nunca me rendiré
No hay nada, pero una victoria

No hay suficiente cuerda para atarme
No hay suficiente cinta para cerrar mi boca
Las piedras que lanzas me pueden hacer sangrar.
Pero no me detendré hasta que seamos libres
Los corazones salvajes no se pueden romper
No, los corazones salvajes no pueden romperse",-0.9943,302

"My revenge on the man who physically abused me and raped me? To not allow that moment to define my life. He tried breaking me. But I'm not broken. I might have been scared and traumatized (for which I have gotten good help), but I've never been broken. I'm still one whole and complete person. I can still love fiercely. Because the best revenge I can think of is to be the happiest version of who I can be. This song brings tears to my eyes because she sings it with such touching almost sad sound, but her message is all but sad. Wild hearts can't be broken. The best revenge is to not be broken. And love and enjoy and appreciate life even more as I did before that son of a bitch tried to break me down.",0.9644,155

"Pretty sure I've already commented on here but I can't find my comment to add on to it so I'll do it separately.

I highly doubt you'll actually see this Pink, but you are my idol, my role model. My mom wasn't around much when I was growing up, so I was raised by a single father and my grandmothers & aunts. I stumbled on your music when I was about 10. Ever since then, your music is where I turn to when I'm going through a rough spot. You inspire me so much. This song came out 8 days after my 22nd birthday, on the 17 year mark of the day my mom walked out on myself and my brothers. On Sept 5th, 2017 I lost my daughter and I've been struggling, some days it's to the point I can't breathe because I miss her so much. We knew even if she lived that she wouldn't have an easy life, and that she would probably be bullied for the rest of her life because of her special medical needs. From the day she was born I would sing Perfect to her so that she always knew she was perfect to her dad and I. I still can't listen to it without crying. When YouTube notified me of a new song by you, I immediately listened to it. I immediately started crying. When my daughter passed, I lost my voice. I was completely shattered. Til I heard this song. Every day this song helps me motivate my soul to keep on because I know my daughter wouldn't want me to be depressed all day. You are an amazing woman and you inspire me so much. I've gone back to my advocacy work for survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse. I've even began to be an advocate for mothers who have lost their children. You are an inspiration, not jus to me, but to thousands maybe even millions of people across America and probably more all around the world. So thank you, Pink. For absolutely everything. Thank you for helping me find my strength again.",0.9687,392
