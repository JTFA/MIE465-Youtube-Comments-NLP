"No, The Farse Awakens was just as terribly regurgitated garbage as The Last Joke. That movie is total crap, with a totally idiotic plot filled with Deus Ex Machines in the form of the most stupid ""coincidences"" to make Jar Jar's poor writting keep going with the plot, like having Poe VANISHING in the air, leaving only his jacket, so BB-8, who coincidentally were found by a Force sensitive Mary Sue, could recognize Finn, a former Stormtrooper who didnt want to commit atrocities for the Empire anymore (I mean, the First Order), who he decides to run away, and to do that he goes on a killing spree of his former fellows Stormtroopers. Back to BB-8, or rather R2-D2 2.0 made to sell toys, Finn's jacket belongs to Poe, so it's so convenient that Poe TELEPORTED away when the ship crashed... But dont worry about Poe, like a good magician he'll magically appear on the Resistance HQ later on, despite his mission being taking BB8 to the Resistance, which means that Poe said ""fuck this shit"" and left BB-8 behind on Generic Tatooine without giving a shit about the map of Luke.

Speaking of all this mess, who the fuck is the First Order? Who the fuck is the Resistance? What are they resisting against? Wasnt the Empire destroyed when Palpatine was killed? Wow, I guess all that celebration with the teddybears called Ewoks was a little premature eh?

Anyway, back to coincidences: Finn and Mary Sue were so luck to find the Millenial Falcon, who coincidentally was staying still on Generic Tatooine, so that Han Solo would conveniently find them, and conviniently tell Mary Sue about the Force. Also, Mary Sue knows more about the ship than Han, and he sees her as a daughter already, even without any good reason for it. Finn desires Mary Sue too (too bad she only sees him as her black friend), and even the villain, Emo Vader, wants her for himself.

Oh yes, speaking of Emo Vader... Not only is he a man-child having his period, but he's also coincidentally the son of Han and Leia.

Also, for all the fans of Star Wars, nothing like seeing that all the love between Han and Leia turned into DIVORCE.

Oh, it's sooooo great to see all the heroes of the original trilogy turned into bitter losers, whose struggles and sacrifices were made useless... Basically, Jar Jar Abhrams SHITTED on top of all the original trilogy, and made every hero from it to be a stupid old and bitter dick, and all their accomplishments became nothing.

Bet to coincidences, it was a struck of luck for Mary Sue to find Han, because he'll take her to Orange She Yoda, who coincidentally have the light stick of Luke Skywalker, who conveniently gives Mary Sue allucinations. After that, she runs, coincidentally gets captured by Emo Vader, but conveniently Mary Sue is too fucking awesome to be mind raped by Emo Vader, but conveniently she's able to mind rape the single Stormtrooper left to guard her, even thou she had never heard about the Force until about half hour before. Meanwhile, the Empire, I mean, the Generic Space Nazis 2.0, destroy the ""New Republic"" with their bigger and newer DeathStar 3.0, because nothing says ""oh, such an awesome movie"" as making idiotic shit that is bigger and bigger and bigger... Oh, so fucking impressive...

Oh yes, and it seems that this entire New Republic is just 5 planets, conveniently placed side by side, so that our super hyper mega ultra DeathStar 3.0 can destroy it all in a single shoot.

Of course that, conveniently, Finn was a janitor inside of DeathStar 3.0, which obviously means that he had access to all kinds of military Secrets about a planet sized base, and also that he has enough knowledge about planet-sized bases, to conveniently be able to inform La Resistancè about the weakness of the Station. Because, you know, that's totally the kind of thing that the Generic Space Nazis 2.0 would be telling to all their janitors.

So, our heroes rush to destroy DeathStar 3.0, and meanwhile Mary Sue gets into a glowing sticks brawl with Emo Vader. She easily makes Emo Vader to be her bitch, but coincidentally a Deus Ex Machine breaks the land, so Mary Sue wouldn't have to deal with any kind of moral dilemas about killing Emo Vader or not. Also, a good Deus Ex Machine to save Emo Vader for EP 8.

"The Farce Aweakens sucked dick and they lost me there. The Last Jegay sucked even more. And Episode IX is going to be a total disaster.

Now you miss George Lucas. I'm dying to read the original story treatments. I'm sure they are infinitely better than this shit that Disney is feeding us.",-0.9442,59

That's what Star Wars really is now, just another stupid love story between a pathetic goofy girl that everybody desires for some reason, and a bad boy, who'll be cured by the power of love.

I believed in you and you didn't disappoint.
If I was Vivian from Pretty Woman i would be saying to you haters, ""You work on commission right? Big mistake. Huge. I have to go shopping now.""

lol , whatever not true (i am in the present.) but you will be sorry. It will be cool. Better stock up on sunglasses. and lol better get your checkbooks warmed up there will be toys like you wouldn't believe. 
ok maybe not but    you  never  know. Start pinching pennies because there might just be that rush you always wanted. (I must be crazy no...I am...but what the hell...I have no friends anyway.)
I hope I'm lucky because the internet humiliation aimed at me will be painful.

"Unlike The Last Jedi , JJ knows what to leave on the edit room floor. Last Jedi has so many unnecessary scenes (which should have been in the extended version) and a few lines of dialogue that were missing in key scenes which would have added to the experience.

"Well, his has his work cut out for him.  He did a very job on the first one and really should have done the entire trilogy, but the second one train-wrecked the franchise at this point.  It did horribly overseas and even the recent Jumanji lasted longer in the theater than the Last Jedi.  It was a failure and utter garbage littered with tons of SJW crap.  Shame really, but Abrams did a fine job with the first one without any of that nonsense in it because he is a FAN of the series.  I'm confident that he will do his best to save it.  My guess is that he will have to use time travel to erase everything from that movie...talk about Dr. Who!  LOL!",0.7835,140

"While TFA was a rehash of ANH, it at least set up a lot of interesting new subplots to explore in the new trilogy. But now thanks to TLJ, all that is ruined, and TFA is now left to just being a rehash. Even better, TLJ has added nothing new or exciting for the future and has effectively killed any excitement for episode 9. They're going to need a hail mary to save this train wreck of a trilogy. Thanks Rian Johnson, for subverting all of our expectations of having of having a good movie. You truly deserve an entire trilogy for yourself after the wonderful work you've done...",0.9466,120
"Why does everyone think he's just gonna rip off Return of the Jedi? The reason The Force Awakens is so similar to A New Hope is because J.J. decided to go the safe route to bring fans back to Star Wars. Now that we're back, he can now go in a more original direction.",0.5849,61
