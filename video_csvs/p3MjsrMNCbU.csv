He can literally do Pavarotti's vocal solo in Miss Sarajevo. And I challenge anyone to find a more beautiful falsetto than Lemon. Speaking of vocal solo's, Bono's masterful vocal solo in With or Without you is outstanding. Bono is old now and his voice is probably 1/3 of what it was when he was in his 20s to early 30s. But even now he's a vocal tour de force. As evident of that absolute master class's performance of Every Breaking Wave from EMA's or whatever. Freddie is probably the best, but Bono gives him a run.

"Goddamn dude.  

Every once in a while--not often, esp these days, but every once in a while--the world recognizes, celebrates, and raises up into view for all to see (and hear) a True Great.  A Master.  Someone who has talent that the rest of us, even if we spent our whole lives trying, could not emulate.  And our reward for this entirely proper universal acclaim is that we get to live in a universe which is now little bit better than before:  emotiomally richer, artisitically complex, and just more beautifully vibrant than before the Master's work was part of human cannon.

Why does everyone agree on the greatness of Freddie Mercury?  For the same reason that no one says they hate Mozart, or that they don't ""get"" Da Vinci's artwork, or that Ella Fitzgerald is overrated, or that Daniel Day Lewis just picks the scripts that make him look good--nobody says those things because as dumb as the human race can collectively be, we know a Master when we see one.  And even when the art isnt necessarily to our taste (like Queen for me, actually), it is still incredible to witness a Master at his or her work.

I was truly lucky to see Freddie perform at Knebworth in 1986, he's last live concert with Queen before his death. While that voice was amazing, his ability to work an audience was equally as impressive, he really was the ultimate showman.

As you get older, it's often easy to look back and think things were better when you were younger. I think when Freddie Mercury was out there banging out songs though, they really were. Nobody has done it better since :-)",0.9849,123
