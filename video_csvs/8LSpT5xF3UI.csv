More like the city of degenerate scum how riot, set fires, flip cars, destroy lamps, and ruin businesses in order to celebrate their victory in the Super Bowl. Seriously tho considering the way their fans acted they didn't deserve the win.",-0.0204,53

The concept of ""delayed gratification"" exists by an INDIVIDUAL'S CHOICE.

"Have you ever seen footage of the Flyers parade in the spring of 1974?  People were standing ON Broad Street - you couldn't see the street - and touched the players who were sitting in cars.  A couple of Flyers had their jacket sleeves torn away by fans..  So, while there were probably more people watching on the ground level at that point of the parade in 1974 than during subsequent parades, authorities couldn't let that happen again.  Not with today's concerns about terrorism.",-0.765,91
