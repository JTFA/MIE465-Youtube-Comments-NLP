HE'S NOT ACTUALLY SOLVING THE RUBIK'S CUBE
If he was, I would like to know what method he used.
It seems like he just used a bunch of twists and turns and ""solved"" it and made music at the same time.

Great video tho.
Just mention that you didn't actually solve it while making the music. I don't like it when people make false claims.

Maybe you can solve the cube. But I couldn't see any familiar method being used in the making of this video.
