What I want to see from Jennie is her giving 200% to her live performances and 100% on her practice. I feel like her practice vids are better than most of her live performance she barely moves a lot!

"She was so uncomfortable in her dress that she couldn't do any proper dance moves. She is never lazy. She worked as an apprentice for six years before making her debut. Most of her team members who had practiced together during this time gave up, but she endured and made her debut. You're lazy? Although costumes were not suitable for performances, the costumes shown at the awards ceremony were more impressive than regular performances, and YG needed to rate them higher than the performances. I think it's too harsh to accuse her of being lazy even after she performed in such a costume.",0.8196,113
Since no one is talking about Jennie I'm here to say that she is absolutely beautiful and she sings very well. Some of you are saying that she is making no efforts to dance but it's been a long time since As if it's your last came out and they keep singing and dancing to it. Maybe Jennie is just tired and maybe tired of dancing on it again and again and we can all understand it. Let her live she is a human and she can be tired too. The four of them are absolutely incredible and beautiful and sing very well and you can't say bad comments about them because I think they are giving us all they can give and I'm fucking proud of them. Appreciate all of them for the incredible women they are,0.9375,143

"Sometimes I wonder if Jennie is YG's relative, because she can afford that lazy attitude onstage. There's a reason why even tho Blackpink is good, they can never catch up to TWICE. In Twice even tho Tzuyu is average in dancing or singing, barely has emotions, she gives her best. Jennie's equivalent in TWICE is Nayeon, but Nayeon is ahead of Jennie in terms of SINGING/DANCING skills, effort and charm (https://www.instagram.com/p/BgGVbiZl_C1/). I always wonder if Jennie thinks she's the prettiest kpop idol and relies on that expecting to be like Seolhyun-level popular, if not Suzy level.. because it doesn't work that way. Seolhyun does a lot of fan-service & openly a sex-symbol. Meanwhile, Jennie doesn't like doing aegyo, so you'd expect she's a badass onstage.. but onstage.. she's such a weak performer without Rose and Lisa spicing things up. Her lazy attitude, the way she chooses which performance deserves her BEST, is dragging the team down. Compared to Red Velvet who always releases songs & does variety.. and then Twice who has energetic members, shameless in fan service and has catchy songs, Blackpink isn't exposed much except ON-STAGE.

 Jennie needs to step up, because the visual is Jisoo.. if Jennie wants to be ""Suzy or Yoona-level"", then she better be ENERGETIC like them in variety shows. They are 5'7 feet ball energy, shameless and busted their asses running in shows, dancing their butts off, before they became icons.",0.99,280

BTW, just asking, maybe i'm wrong or maybe not. But, why Lisa as my ""knowledge"" and listening some live videos, is she lipsync in that song? (As if it's your last) i think in the other songs is lipsynching too... (Nothing personal, just a doubt).
PSD: I don't like famous girl group with a very talented girls have to lipsync live.
