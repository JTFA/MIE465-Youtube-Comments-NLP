Twenty-one North Korean cheerleaders imprisoned
AP , SEOUL            Sat, Feb 18, 2006 - Page 4

Twenty-one members of North Korean cheering squads who traveled to South Korea for international sports events are being held in a prison camp for talking about what they saw in the South, a news report said 17 February 2006.

Citing a North Korean man who recently fled to China, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said the 21 young women had been detained about last November 2005 in the same prison camp where the man had been held.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service didn't immediately confirm or deny the report.

In 2002, Pyongyang sent hundreds of female cheerleaders to the Asian Games in South Korea's Busan, where their tightly synchronized routines drew worldwide attention. The North sent similar cheering squads to South Korea in 2003 and last year.

The defector, whose real name wasn't given, said the female cheering squad apparently violated a pledge not to speak about what they saw in South Korea, the Chosun Ilbo reported.

Citing another unnamed defector, the newspaper said the cheerleaders had pledged before going to South Korea that they would treat the country as ""enemy territory"" and never speak about what they saw there, accepting punishment if they broke the promise.

Pyongyang insists it doesn't abuse human rights, but it has long been accused of holding political prisoners in camps under life-threatening conditions. It is believed to hold between 150,000 and 200,000 political prisoners",-0.9172,284

"Those cheerleaders the media LOVED from North Korea are actually SEX SLAVES
http://therightscoop.com/those-cheerleaders-the-media-loved-from-north-korea-are-actually-sex-slaves/
Feb. 23, 2018 10:37 pm by SooperMexican

One of the more disgusting things we saw during the Olympics is how the mainstream media fell over themselves to praise North Korea just because they wanted to make Trump look bad. They just loved the North Korean cheerleaders and how they were so well trained and seemed so happy.

Except they‚Äôre actually sex slaves who are raped by the North Korean officials:
https://nypost.com/2018/02/23/defector-claims-north-koreas-cheerleaders-are-actually-sex-slaves/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPTwitter&utm_medium=SocialFlow

    Members of the North Korean national cheerleading squad ‚Äî who have been featured gleefully rooting at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics ‚Äî are systematically forced to have sex with high-ranking members of Kim Jong Un‚Äôs twisted regime, according to a disturbing report.

    Behind the scenes, the troupe ‚Äî dubbed the ‚ÄúPleasure Squad‚Äù by insiders ‚Äî are forced to perform sex acts on party leaders during their trip to the Olympics, a defector with knowledge of the sexual slavery told Bloomberg News.

    ‚Äú[The] troupe came here and performed with dances and songs, and it might seem like a fancy show on the outside [but] they also have to go to parties and provide sexual services,‚Äù said defector Lee So Yeon, a military musician who fled the country in 2008, during Kim Jong Un‚Äôs regime.

Shamefully, the South Koreans weren‚Äôt as stupid as our media is, and they saw right through the North Korean BS. 
http://therightscoop.com/south-koreans-cant-believe-mainstream-news-is-fawning-over-north-korean-propaganda/

And this too:

    Yeon‚Äôs account of the sexual slavery piggybacks on past reports in which female defectors from North Korea have described being ‚Äúselected‚Äù to sexually service members of the political party.

    In 2010, defector Mi-hyang said she was only 15 years old when soldiers in green uniforms stormed her classroom and chose her to become a sex slave for Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un, according to Marie Claire magazine.

    She was forbidden from seeing her family and forced to spend 10 years sexually pleasuring him, according to the report.

    Lee Il-nam, a nephew of Kim Jong Un‚Äôs father, who defected in 1982, also detailed some of the ‚ÄúPleasure Squad‚Äù parties in his book.

Well that‚Äôs horrific. Try to cleanse your brain of that terribleness with this hilarious video of a Kim Jong Un impersonator crashing in on the cheerleader sex squad:
