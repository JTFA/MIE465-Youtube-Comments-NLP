"Happy New Year's everyone! I am the prophet and I've come to tell you how glorious 2018 will be! A great awakening will happen and humanity will never be happier or more united. You are loved even if you don't love yourself. 

I do have a message for the Illuminati though...your time is over. You no longer have power. Humanity has come together like it never has through prayer and mass meditations. We have the power now. Don't think you can crawl back into the shadows and wait for the heat to be off you, not happening this time.

Your Gods are pathetic and washed up and you have turned against the Creator. Your empires will fall into the hands of the united people and they will see you for the vermin you truly are. Bring harm to any patriot and you will curse your bloodline for 5000 generations. Be gone foul creatures.

We resurrected Kek through meme magic. He brings chaos to our enemies. Thoth taught us wisdom. Jesus loves us. Brigit burns the fires so we may keep watch. Humanity has realized the true power of their spirituality.  We are united and our prayers have been heard.",0.9444,222
