H00 DINI I listened to that section 10 times before I read the comments thinking the same. It's unfortunate no YouTube comments are taken seriously. That deviation from the original song is where his voice really shines. It's just a few seconds...but someone needs to tell him to get to that vocal intensity more. It's unique and will elevate their performances.,-0.5574,68
