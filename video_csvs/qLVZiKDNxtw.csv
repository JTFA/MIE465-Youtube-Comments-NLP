5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.

6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.

7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.

8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.

9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.

good questions andy,0.4404,3
he didn't say anything bad at all about Taylor and even when asked to clarify that he was Team Kim he didn't even say that either he chose to say 'theres no such thing as teams' like. its a game where he HAS to choose someone and he clearly has nothing against taylor and only chose Kim cause he's closer to her that's all. like calm down swiftie,0.8641,72

"jamelandi 
Do you see me arguing with you over who’s team Taylor or team Kim? Exactly, so try again. My only stance here is on Sam. Sam’s persona seems FAKE AF. Idc if he knows who I am because I’m not begging for his love like you are begging for Kim’s 😒 ... you people are weird and strangely obsessive.",-0.6037,74
"jamelandi no the thrill of it all got worse reviews, reputation got fat better reviews and was placed higher on the majority of year end critics list. Sam Smith’s Music is simply commercial ballad music made for people who think they have a better taste of music then they do when reality it’s just a pure boring snooze fest.",-0.128,66

"ok I know what he said was kind of shady since he and Taylor have been seen together many times, but ffs can interviewers stop asking EVERY celebrity on their opinion of this feud? it just creates more drama if the celebrity being asked has to “pick a side” 🙄",-0.8546,54

steve Reputation’s US sales outsold his worldwide sales in a DAY and sold 2.2M worldwide in 3 weeks. meanwhile his album hasn’t even sold 1M copies yet. he’s over.,0.0,39
"steve honey here’s the thing. Taylor is a business woman. She keeps the people entertained. People buy her album because it’s very close to her life. They listen to her music to get gossip and try to find out what she’s doing in her life and who she’s dating and stuff like that. People like drama, it’s a fact. People like Adele are very personal. Those artists write songs and are sold very well because of the talent. Taylor,( of course she has talent and is a beautiful young woman) sells THAT MUCH because people want the drama.",0.9623,121
