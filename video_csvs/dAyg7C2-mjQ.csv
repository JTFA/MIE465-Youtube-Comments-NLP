364 dislikes is so insensitive. This type of abuse happens to young girls and women all too much. And when they feel like they have to be remain silent. Not only their dignity is violated but their voice is too. So for for every dislike on this subject you are telling a victim to remain silent.,-0.7962,61

As evil as this is, it's an opportunity to make things right going forward. Don't let the opportunity pass. The world is listening and is ready to support efforts to force the needed change.

"A long story short: The gymnastics girls liked Doctor Larry. Then some lawyers understood big money can be obtained from suing Michigan State University, the United States Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics, and they spoke to the girls. Girls turned around and discovered they had been badly ""raped"" (often in front of their family). Fortunately MONEY can heal EVERYTHING, even the guilt of enjoying some shy furtive genital rubbing. Poor NASSAR is pennyless BUT taxpayers' pockets are deep. Softporn star Aly RAISMAN jumped on the gravy train. NASSAR is an irrelevant pawn. MONEY is the only worthwhile target.",0.34,115
"Alex’s williams Larry Nassar, the team doctor for USA gymnastics sexually assaulted multiple athletes during ""treatments,' for things such as an injury. This doctor convinced these girls that when he was doing god knows what, that he was helping their injuries heal. So they kept quiet for years. The first report against Larry came out in 1997 and USA gymnastics basically ignored it. Larry was also a doctor at MSU and abused patients there as well. The Karolyi's, who ran the national team for almost sixteen years are also being sued by a former gymnast who states that they physically and mentally abused the gymnasts during their camps. It's believed the two also knew of the abuse and while they did nothing about it. The Karolyi ranch has just been closed down because of all this. Valeri Luiken (Nastia's dad) took over as the new national team coordinator when Martha Karyoli retired after the 2016 games, but he also recently quit as well. So USA gymnastics is just a mess right now and I wonder if there will be a team for the 2020 games.",-0.7717,206

I also think it would be a good idea to get a women doctor the exam the girls but if they the board of USA gymnastics insists on having a male doctor someone from the board to accompany every girl to an appointment.

I was raped at 18 years old passed out in a bed at a friends house. I had no idea that he had just had sex on me until it was finished and he was hitting my face asking me if I was on the pill. I reported it to the police because I didn’t even know who this person was let alone gave him consent. They did nothing but talk to him and I was left to be humiliated by having to pluck my own pubic hairs out. I had to take the morning after pill. I had to take medication afterwords in case he had an std.  I had to have an HIV test periodically to make sure I was clean. It affected me so much that I gained about 150 pounds and I hid from the world because the DA did nothing. Now this was in 1988 and it wasn’t a widely  talked about “thing”.  I am now 47 and I’m still hurt by this. I’m not a victim I’m a survivor but it’s with me forever and it’s a part of me and part of me I wish wasn’t with me.,0.3403,224

It seems like the common sense solution is for club owners to take responsibility to eliminate all opportunities for an abuser to offend by setting up strict staff policies.  1. Never be alone with a child who is not your own. 2. Staff must always be in appropriate public areas of the facilities or in offices equipped with video recording equipment. 4. Coaches don't let children sit on your lap.  3. Parents travel to and from competition with their own children.   As for elite or national team competitions where there are national team staff or doctors working with the athletes simply never allow anyone to be alone with an athlete.  As a coach in the sport for 27 years it just seems like common sense stuff to me. The parents also need to take more responsibility for communicating with their own children as to what is appropriate and what is not in a coach athlete relationship.,-0.1446,168

"So, abuse has to hit you in the face to see it? The Olympics has been abusing children and destroying childhood for over a hundred years. For 8 1/2 years I drove a cab in Denver, Colorado and I got people regularly from the Olympics Training Center in Colorado Springs. People will tell a cab drive things they would never tell anyone else and boy did they have a lot to say. This sexual abuse is nothing compared to the hundreds of stories I've heard. You can start with brutal training at around 5 years old. 

Russia and its former ""republics"" went public about this and nothing was done, not even investigating. Like everyone else I use to enjoy watching the olympics until I started hearing these stories. I haven't watched the Olympics for over 40 years. It's become a political pissing contest between countries and not a set of values intended to bring nations together. People should have seen the writing on the wall of what a modern Olympics would become if they took just a little time to study what the ancient Greek Olympics really was.

America has become a sex obsessed nation and now we see it being used as heavy artillery by the leftist feminists. Do you really think females are the only ones being abused in nearly all areas of life? The biggest perversion here isn't sex, but we are so attracted to yet another display of female innocents being destroyed. This extremely well organized political strategy is totally one sided. Do we hear about female abusers, no. Do we hear about female blackmail, no. Do we hear about female false accusations, no. Do we hear about prostitution (including homosexual) in the military, no? Do we hear about the destruction of so many families from simply being accused, no. What we do see is a massive attack on heterosexual men and the insane practice of guilt by accusation. 

You are so ""disgusted""? You know damn well what goes on in the Olympics mega business, but it's safe to attack one man. Of all the sexual abuse of both female and males, only one goes public? The Olympics have become so big that only a country can fund it. If all the types of abuse and neglect were to go public no one could keep up with it. When hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake, negative public exposure is totally controlled. Hell, those powerful people probably thought this tremendous public exposure will boost the Olympic in South Korea.

You won the gold and you were still a little girl. Your coach is/was Chinese born in China and was a coach for the Chinese Olympic team. He's a real sweetheart I'm sure.  If you want to know how significant that is take a good look at how children are treated in China. How about telling people what happens to those who don't win the gold? Their lives become focused on only one thing that is more machine than a human life. When all is done there is nothing to show for all that effort and sacrifice. What is ""DISGUSTING"" is it's all done for a mega business. Why don't you make a very short list of say 50 disgusting people (including your communist coach) in the Olympics that aren't sexual deviants? How does it feel to be a feminist political soldier?

"Some of the parents failed their children too. You can't tell me that this went on for twenty plus years and not one of the parents knew something about this situation. In my opinion, some of the parents turned a blind eye in order to get their children further in gymnastics.

"Thank you for making this video. I’m also a victim of sexual assault but it wasn’t with a coach.. it still hurts my heart so much to see these girls and women come forward and speak their statements on tv. My dad watched many of them with me and he knows what happened to me so he’s very protective over these situations, and he would sit in front of the tv and cry and then get pissed and want to kill that man. And I can’t blame him. Just like the father that went at Larry Nassar. I don’t blame him. I’d do the same for my child because this situation hits me so closely. It’s so terrible to hear that you said you wouldn’t even put your own daughter in USA gymnastics. There needs to be a change, instead of focusing only on winning. Because that’s probably why a lot of the girls didn’t say something sooner, because they probably thought they’d lose their chances winning a medal and in fear of getting kicked out. It’s so sad that hundreds of girls and women have to come forward for something to finally happen to him and whoever that first girl/woman was, I give you so much credit and love your way. You are brave. All of you are brave. And I love you. Even though I don’t know any of you. This is a time for women and girls to come together and be strong and not be afraid to come forward. Your life and mental health is more important than a gold medal. Because after sexual abuse, your entire life changes. You can’t trust anyone. You are so limited to having relationships. You sit here at night and for some reason think, “maybe it was my fault..” Which it’s NOT. And you have to live with that abuse your entire life. A gold medal, or any medal for that matter, is not worth the trauma. Just like Shawn said, speak up and don’t be afraid. You have millions of people backing you up and we LOVE you. It’s so important that is women, or men, unite through this. Let’s get other predators locked up for these crimes. Because they ARE crimes. If you are going through a similar situation, or notice your child or sister or friend having problems and mentioning things about sexual abuse or any abuse for that matter, PLEASE report it and talk about it. You can’t get help unless you come forward to someone. ANYONE! A friend, family member, a teacher, a police officer, a firefighter, or even just a random person.

"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  

Jesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... 

Jesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.

Jesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV

Acts 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV

Jesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP

Jesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP

Romans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV

Romans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV

1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV

And REPENT...

Acts 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP

Jesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP

1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV

From what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.

Please get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…

And don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.

"What the real problem here is, is one of power.  The person in power commands us to interpret reality as he/she tells us to interpret that reality.  Dr Nassar calls it ""medical treatment"" when he reaches inside someone's body cavity and insists that everyone agree with him, that this is ""treatment"" and not molestation.  This violates not only the privacy of one's body, but is an invasion of one's mind.  One is being told that something obvious, is not what it obviously is.  So of course that creates deep distrust.  The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston went through this a number of years ago, when a group of priests began molesting young boys.  The very same priests who pretended that celibacy was somehow holier than sex, were molesting little kids and then commanding the kids to help them lie about it.  Reading through the 170-odd reactions given here, a great many people now distrust the entire USAG governing body because it did nothing to stop the molesting from continuing.  I'd say the starting point for reform, is to get rid of all forms of bullying from the organization.  No child should be pressured to participate in a sport that the child doesn't want to play.  Start from that point...nobody ever develops real talent unless they love what they're doing, so much, that they keep wanting to do more of it.  Once we accept that it's okay to quit the sport if it's not for you, then we can get serious about how to develop the skills of people who want to be in the sport.  Somehow, a lot of people ignored all the signs that this molestation was happening, because they wanted to believe the bully instead of the victims...and the victims felt pressure to conform, rather than speak the truth. Shawn and her husband seem like sexy people...they don't get in our faces and brag about it, but it's obvious that they do what people do when in love. Between themselves, they know that they're having sex because they want to.  What Dr Nassar did, was not only to have his way with his victims, but to force the victims to help him lie about what he was doing and why he did it.  A lot of the harm those victims feel, is that Dr Nassar convinced them there was something abnormal about how they reacted to being molested...and everyone around him seemed to reinforce that.  Only the truth is capable of undoing the damage caused by such lies.  Let's never pressure anyone into going along with a lie again.  Starting right with that initial lie some kids learn...they stay in the sport because their family likes them in it, even though it's not what the child really wants to do.  If USAG develops a truthfulness culture that can accept any truth, including ""I'd rather do some other sport than this"", it can prevent the deception from rising to this extreme.",-0.1016,556

"What we can do to change this: Stop silencing women, let them speak, don't discount a woman or girl's opinion in favor of a man, elect more women into positions of power ESPECIALLY in arenas which house all-girl groups, educate yourselves and others regarding marginalized groups; learn about how historically up to as late as the 1980s, women were not believed, nor were children, when they complained of abuse as so many people in power were men who did not want things to change and wanted to keep benefiting from the system in place, stand hand in hand with people of color who also have been marginalized by systems that support and promote only white men in decision making endeavors.

"What's disgusting, Shawn, is that the parents of every single girl, pushed their girls to idolize gym beyond God, their virtue, bodies, others, anything and anyone. Then after the molestation, over 100 girls, 1 girl at a time, became accessories to other girls molestation because they didn't want ""their dream"" to be negatively affected. Narcissistic idolatry. Google those two words. Nassar couldn't have done this for 1 week without this demonically sick parent driven idolatrous construct. THAT is how evil works. A million abortions a year and 500,000 dead in Syria and you're bitching about the USGA after supporting the serial rapist Clinton family at the 2008 DNC?

Shawn, are there any articles or resources that explain the situation from the parents point of view? I can’t find anything, other than they did not know it was happening because that evil being positioned the girls such that they couldn’t see it. Let me be clear again, it is not the parents fault, but I think it is important  piece of the puzzle. Part of the overhaul of the system needs to include the parents of the gymnasts. They were victims too and I think that they need more control and access than coaches and other USAG staff have.
