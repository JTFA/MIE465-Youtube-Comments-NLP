I watched it recently and it is just so heartwarming and lovely to look at, I think you'd love it because its all about the fairytale magic of wearing a beautiful Dior dress! Its not a Christmas film but it is just the sweetest film called Mrs Arris Goes To Paris. Its on Youtube here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW2jfdJxOEg . I really recommend curling up with a hot chocolate and watching it you will love it :-) xx from Melbourne Australia",0.9831,116
