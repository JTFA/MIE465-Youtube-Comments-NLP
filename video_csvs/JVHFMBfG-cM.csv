"1) When Amy squealed, I (internally) squealed, because I too, thought that was an absolutely brilliant birthday gift. For someone who's into a thing...if you have the resources, DO THAT THING (or that themed thing) for that person! You rocked it out Mayim!!! 2) I'm all for saving sex until marriage, so one of the things I appreciate about Sheldon and Amy's relationship, is that it's one of the closest examples in mainstream primetime of any intimate action having a greater impact BECAUSE of the wait. Sheldon and Amy's first kiss rocked so many viewers because you saw the gradual build to it over the course of years. Same thing with their first time. People cared more and were happier to see it happen (and it seemed to matter more to the characters), because it wasn't rushed and you saw the growth. Probably an unpopular opinion...but idc. xD",0.9824,177

"I loved this episode, and I loved hearing your comments on it! I get so tired of seeing sick characters who look better than I do on my best day, so I was genuinely happy about the fact that Sheldon and Amy truly looked ill in this episode. It spoke volumes to me that you both care more about the art of acting and getting a moment right than what you personally look like. I also loved how romantic Sheldon was willing to be, and seeing the two of you jump high at the end (when you were heading to the bounce house) as a throw-back to our younger years when these sorts of shots were common on TV. It made me laugh so much! :D

"I too am so impressed with both Amy and Sheldon's character development. I don't believe real life offers fairy tale endings for anyone, however, individuals can purposely mature out of a quirky and imbalanced state of just 'existing' though life. 

I am greatly disappointed that the writers introduced an invisable  baby character. Up to Haley's birth,  the show had a true concept of life-relatable reality for the viewers. This episode worsened the Haley phenomena. Not a single immediate family member was invited to the child's 1st birthday. A 1st birthday is a monumental event in American households.  Bernadette's strong and ever increasing influence upon Howard has caused him to grow out of his  child like mentality. By now, Howard's fatherly instincts and desire to not repeat his Dad's mistakes would have induced Howard to plan the party of the century for Haley.  These oversights by the writers cemented the hypothesis that Haley is nothing more than a figment of imagination.",0.9,176

"I wonder who they will get to play Sheldon's brother when he comes to the wedding? I was thinking they should get the actor playing his dad on Young Sheldon to do it. :o)

Also, I think it would be fun to have a ""cross-over"" episode where they get the actor who plays young Sheldon to play him in a ""what would it have been like if everyone knew each other as kids"" episode. and find some young actors to play everyone else. Thinking along the lines of ""The Cooper Extraction"" but instead of no Sheldon in their lives, what if he was always a part of their lives since they were kids? :o)",0.8924,127

Kudos to Mayim for being real about what a person looks like when they're sick.  I usually just shake my head when a 'sick' character appears with slightly touseled hair and no lip gloss.  That sure as heck isn't how *I* look when I'm sick.

As a mayor fangirl of basically everything I like, including TBBT of course, it's so interesting to get an insight into she show and your thought process. I've always wondered what kind of character actors need to have in order to forget themselves and only focus on the character, and that pushing past your insecutities line explained that a bit to me. Thank you so much for your honesty!",0.915,92
"Mayim, I seriously doubt the show would have lasted this long (or I would still be watching ), if you hadn't been cast as Amy. Another actor would not have had your unique, real life character to make such an impact. The physicality you inject and the comedic delivery of your lines is perfect. The amazing relationship between Amy and Sheldon, has been a constant joy to watch all these years. Of course all of your cast mates are great and I don't mean to take anything away from their talent, but personally I think you two have elevated the show so much. Thankyou Mayim and Jim. For all the laughs and the quirky love moments!",0.9672,129
"Mayim, the episode was beyond amazing! You and Jim - again - were absolutely terrific. Even though your make-up was making you look very sick, your beauty was still shining through.
And the development of SHAMY is too sweet for words. Their relationship is in my opinion the best that I've ever witnessed in my 23 years on earth. And I know that those are fictional characters but this doesn't mean that we don't learn important things about love, intimacy, friendship and life..
What I especially keep learning from Sheldon and Amy is that your true ""soulmate"" is the person you will do everything for and  the person with whom you enjoy spending time the most. I see this since season 4 with Shamy, long before they had an intimate relationship. And yes, seeing Sheldon eager to make love to Amy makes my fangirl heart screeming. And yet I don't mind the annual coïtus activity because this is another beautiful, weird part about their relationship that most of the people - like the other characters from the show- just don't get it. 
In conclusion: I love you Mayim. :>",0.9957,212

"This show has always been so fun and such a joy to watch!  I loved this episode!! When you and Sheldon were laying on the bed and he brought up the idea of intimacy, I thought I would die laughing!  He seemed so typically man!  The look on your face is one we have all made while sick, after tending children all day, or for any other reason!!",0.8781,78
"This was an awesome video.
I'd be really interested to see you sit down with someone and talk about how Aspergers is portrayed on the show. I know people go on about how Sheldon has Aspergers, but after watching the show for the long time, it seems like all the main characters (except Penny) has Aspergers. And it's one of the reasons why I really like the show. It shows how complex and different people with Aspergers can be, and not just how people tend to portray as a straight white male who is awkward and quirky.",0.8884,107

You blogged about the episode but you aren't using that as a script to make a longer YT video? Shame on you! And a few vids back you said you are short when you're actually about average height for a female. I ran across your channel when playfully looking for fun with flags. :-),0.7871,58

You have no idea how happy I am once a week when there is a new episode!  Otherwise, the show is on n I have seen repeats as many as 5 times n it never ever gets old.  I always have a chuckle or laugh outloud.  People must wonder what is going on in my apartment?!   Keep up the fantastic work.  No one can play the character as you do.....so best wishes from Canada Mayim/Amy!!!😍",0.9864,121

"is the show starting to wrap up?
I mean it seems like the writers want to finally fit everyone except Rajesh (who is made fun of for his femininity and portrait as probably secretly also gay... which is kind of homophobic...) to fit into societies social constructs and norms...
also do you think this show celebrates geek culture? Because I only see it as making fun of it so that hippsters and not really geeks can laugh at to extremely nerdy people...",0.9663,90
