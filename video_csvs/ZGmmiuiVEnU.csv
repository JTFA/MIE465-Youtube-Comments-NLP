"1 Corinthians 6:9-18

9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will NOT  inherit the kingdom of God?
 Do not be deceived:

neither the sexually immoral, 
nor idolaters, 
nor adulterers, 
nor men who practice homosexuality,
nor thieves, 
nor the greedy, 
nor drunkards, 
nor revilers, 
nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

  18 Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
 
   All must REPENT from Sin to enter thy kingdom of God.",-0.1791,105

"For those saying that this movie celebrates 'the bad guy,' you clearly missed the point of the whole bloody film... the whole point si to get away from the 'Villain' vs 'victim' narrative. Tonya is someone that has been labelled the 'villain' and Kerrigan as the 'victim' ever since that incident. They are both true and not true titles, both fail to capture the true nuance and complexity of both them as individuals, and of the event itself. They both have been owned and played off of each other by the media ever since, both reporting the facts of the case and pitting this fantastical fairytale piece of villains and victims when life isnt that simple. And if you watch the film, it isnt celebrating Harding at all, it makes it clear that Harding is an unreliable figure and that the truth isnt clear. Yes it doesnt consider Nancy's side of it, but its called I, Tonya for a reason- this is the story that treats her as a complex human being, an individual to like and to dislike, with flair and flaws in equal measure.

I said that Hollywood celebrates bad people like Polanski so no-one should really be surprised by anything when it comes to Hollywood. As for my feeling ""icky"", I'm not sure what I believe when it comes to Tonya's story but I don't agree with people benefiting financially from a crime they committed or were an accessory to.
