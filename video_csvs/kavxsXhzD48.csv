"Could you please do something on Crowley's Mongoose and it's greater meaning. Perhaps you could talk about not only it's symbolism to real life but it's importance to the themes of Promethea.
The following is the version taken from Alan Moore's graphic novel Promethea.

We come from mirrors,
We come from smoke,
Aleister Crowley tells a joke,
Which, if it's understood, they say,
Will make all magic clear as day...
There were these two men, sharing a railway carriage. They didn‚Äôt know each other. They just happened to be travelling together. One of the men had, resting in his lap, a cardboard box with holes punched in the top. After some time spent contemplating what might be inside his travelling companion‚Äôs box, the other man at last could not contain his curiosity. He said, ‚ÄúExcuse me, but I couldn‚Äôt help noticing your box. Does it contain some variety of animal?‚Äù The other man, though obviously surprised by this impertinent intrusion from a stranger, smiled politely as he answered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely right. There is indeed a creature kept inside this box. And furthermore, I may reveal, the animal in question is a mongoose.‚Äù
The first man, who‚Äôd initiated the enquiry, was astonsihed by this revelation. Spluttering with surprise, he sought some further explanation of this certainly provocative disclosure made by his strange fellow-traveller. ‚ÄúA mongoose? Sir I must confess I had expected it to be perhaps a cat, or rabbit, not a creature so exotic and outlandish. The animal you mention so excites my curiosity that I must beg you, sir, to tell me more. Where are you bound with such a specimen, if I may be so bold?‚Äù The other man, who sat with the perforated box on his lap, shrugged wearily as he replied, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs something of a personal matter, as it concerns a family tragedy. However, since I‚Äôm confident I may rely on your discretion, I suppose I don‚Äôt mind sharing my unfortunate account with you.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù the man went on, ‚Äúthis sorry tale concerns my elder brother. He‚Äôs always been what I suppose you might refer to as the black sheep of the family. He has for many years indulged himself in a predictable and commonplace array of vices, of which the worst is his fondness for strong spirits. His drinking has progressed until he is now in the final stages of delerium tremens. My brother now sees serpents everywhere, which is the reason I am taking him this mongoose, that he may be rid of them.‚Äù
‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù the other man interjected, looking puzzled, ‚ÄúBut, these snakes your brother sees‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt they imaginary snakes?‚Äù
‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù his fellow traveller replied. ‚ÄúBut this,‚Äù and here he gestured meaningfully to the perforated box set on his lap, ‚Äúis an imaginary mongoose.‚Äù


It's all about magic as creativity and imagination, not unlike Neil Gaiman's Dream and if you haven't read Promethea, and you really enjoyed The Sandman I highly suggest Promethea, this happens in the twelth vol/issue.
Thanks for the amazing Nerdwriter and have a good day! ^-^

However, many of my friends quite liked the film and enjoyed it but they haven't seen as many movies as I. so I'm kind of torn.

"I love you videos. Freshly subbed!! Please...i have trouble explaining to people how bad Guardians of the galaxy 2 and thor ragnarok were. And the problem comes from arguing against die hard fanboys and because the movies are bad from a movie quality perspective, and not material adaptation to which they love to cling. 

My biggest dissapointment of 2017 is that guardians 2 was praised as a top 5 movie of the year, while an actually well made movie like King arthur:legend of the sword, was shunned because ""it didnt adapt the material propperly"".  

If i may ask/suggest maybe a video on either why guardians 2/thor ragnarok were bad movies, or at least how king arthur is actually a good movie. Thank you and keep up the awesome work",0.5972,150

"I'm at USC's film school right now, and I'm so happy to have seen this video - we had an intense semester learning several different components that go into making a film, but the most draw-dropping discovery was definitely how sound was worked into film, from design (backgrounds, dialogue, sfx, adr, etc.) to foleying, sound mix, music, and the works -- watching films or just walking around and truly listening to what's around you, how many different sounds are going on, how coarse or dry they are dependent on the texture of the ground and so forth, the subconscious effect it makes - wow",0.9487,121

"Irreversible is a film that combines an intense visual and auditory connection. The soundtrack is actually designed to make you feel nauseous at certain points.

Just saw this.  I'm a huge coward where suspense and horror films are concerned and when I see one at the movies I miss most of the action because I shut AND cover my eyes. But at home I can see these movies because the music that in the movies told me to close my eyes at home tells me to turn off the sound. It's amazing how without sound the film is perfectly innocuous. Once it made me wonder if deaf people were fearless. Did Ernest Becker ever address this in his book.

To be honest, it's easier when it's a low-budget anime, where they can generally tell much more story using the sounds than with the visuals, as the visuals are more expensive. A high-budget anime starts telling the story mainly through the visuals (and how they distort reality), and live action tends to rely a lot on the actors' facial expressions.",0.8718,96
