"I can see an argument for Monsters Inc. being more of a gray area, but we are talking about a single film there (the prequel doesn't have ""Inc."" in the title so it doesn't really count).  It was also being referred to in both manners pretty much from the get-go when it came out.

I've never seen or been aware of any official commercial, advertisement, TV show, movie, etc. in which, when pronounced out loud, it is pronounced ""Bros"" instead of ""Brothers.""  Also as someone who grew up with the original games, in the hey-day of NES, when it was the biggest console around and Mario was the end-all-be-all in gaming, I never heard anyone pronounce it that way when casually talking about the game.  Any short-hand version of referring to those games would typically come in the form of dropping ""Bros."" entirely and just referring to the games as Super Mario/Super Mario 1, Super Mario 2, etc. (that even occurred in some actual ads).   Relatively speaking, pronouncing it as ""Bros"" is a really recent development.
