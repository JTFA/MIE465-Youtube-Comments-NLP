I just bought 18 no-name brushes from Amazon for like $20 and they are fabulous and unicorn colored 🦄💖. I do have some more expensive ones from Zoeva and Mac too, but the cheap ones are amazing especially the eye blending brushes. 
Unless they clean the house and drive the kids to school, I’m not spending $ 360 on brushes.",0.9428,77
"That give away looks amazing, I just got into makeup channels and yours really helps. It would be awesome to win so that I could get a start on a makeup journey, if you will.",0.9392,39
"That moment when a millionaire is selling flimsy-cheap looking-overpriced brushes that look like paint brushes I used in my 3rd grade art class to glaze pottery. And let me say this now: she’s overselling these things, they really aren’t worth that price. It looks like something you’d get from the dollar tree. 

Okay another thing, silver metallic paint and bags don’t scream luxury, they scream tacky generic, trash(unless it’s actually used sparingly) let’s be honest here, matte is still beautiful and it’s not a literal eye sore, now before I get ripped to shreds over a fucking opinion, understand I’m objected to my own opinion. Then again, why do I care?

Don’t waste your money on cheap looking art supplies and just get something from Sephora, get some Brushes from Amazon, and spend that left over money on your education. Then you can even learn about what makes cosmetics, make your own and make them hella cool. You never know, you could end up more famous than Kylie and freaking KPop idols(okay I take that second one back) don’t limit yourselves to something small. The sky isn’t the limit, your imagination is.
