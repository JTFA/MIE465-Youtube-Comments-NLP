How does being a better driver prevent the vehicle in front of you from stopping suddenly without warning?,0.5324,19
"I agree any 'driver' could have easily avoided the impending crash.
We seem to have two options here, 1. Of braking a lot quicker and harder, and 2. That he could have already been aware of his surroundings and therefore knew to change lanes.

But I think you may be missing a pretty important point.
The car was FULL of technology (cameras, screens, techs!) there were 3 in the back and one interviewing from the front, and they are obviously all people who are tech experts MEGA interested in the conversation. 
The lapse of concentration to act in a safe manner in what I'd call standard everyday driving (as lets face it, other cars are constantly trying to kill us), was DUE to all this tech happening stuff. I suspect the driver if on his own would have had a lot more concentration focused on the road ahead. But in THAT environment? It is similar to having 4 naked women in the car talking about sex! As TECH stuff is their excitement not girls.

I mean no one had cameras facing out of the car looking for all the hot chicks! They had their cameras filming the screens! HOT STUFF, and the REASON why the driver had a lapse in judgement.
Note: 4 naked girls in your car does not automatically give you the right to crash, but we would FULLY understand if you did ;)",0.7431,267

"I have been driving on the road doing delivery driving for 30 plus years and have even driven a semi truck fully loaded. I have seen my share of incidents on the road.

Which he clearly did not do. This is my opinion and I think he should have been able to get out of that situation in the first place. I understand what you are saying, but I also look at the other side of the coin and think yeah maybe this could have been avoided. Everyone has an opinion and you think mine sucks, so be it. At least there were no injuries and things can be fixed and learned and move on. That's how real life works.",-0.6249,167

If the guy hit the brakes he should have also check if clear to  changed lanes which in this case it was to avoid rear ending a stop vehicle. I have done this before when some idiot decided to stop in the freeway exit ramp to yield to other frontage access road traffic.,-0.836,81

Why didnt he just break the car himself so he didnt fuck up the other persons??? And dont say the breaks couldnt break fast enough cause i have a 2015 and the breaks could have avoided that,0.308,40
"Why not just put sensors on the road that cars will follow like a train track instead of following painted stripes,  self driving cars will not have this problem.  The only thing the car will need to focus on is lane changes and objects in front of the car,  which was unfortunate this car didn't seem to sense & avoid.  I still feel in the future auto drive feature should be mandatory at least in the high way at some point in the future when all issues have been solved - they still cause less accidents than humans even today.",-0.6632,105

"You are such a moron for thinking he could of changed lanes that quickly in a highway. Do you actually drive often? They were doing a review of the car that claims to self drive and clearly failed, nobody expected this to happen. You cant just lane switch last second like they do in movies , it could of been a lot more worse if they got hit by an oncoming car, this was probably the only good option was to go ahead and rear end the car.
