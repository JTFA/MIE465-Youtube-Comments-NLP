"So first things first ""The Beauty Inside"" was originally an American film that came out the same month and year that the book ""Every Day"" did, August 2012. Yes, South Korea made a remake of ""The Beauty Inside"" 3 years later. The thing is though ""The Beauty Inside"" is based on a person whose appearance changes everyday...race, age, gender, etc. While ""Every Day"" seems to be about actually living a each day as an already existing person of the same age. So my point is...Calm the hell down and just enjoy the trailer. Watch the movie or don't watch it. I don't even know why I wasted time explaining this. Who are you people? How'd I get here?...",0.8708,147
