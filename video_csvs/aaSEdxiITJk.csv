"While enjoying it, I hope people can watch Call Me By Your Name with a critical eye too. The difference between the two characters in age and their differing positions of authority both are leaving a sour taste in the mouths of some. Also the casting choice - and rationale behind it - of having straight actors (once again) play the roles of gay characters is something that should be questioned. Even the perspective and telling of the story itself alongside the casting shouldn't be accepted without consideration. For example, what might these be saying or neglecting to acknowledge about lgbt identities and the struggles of lgbt people in this society in relation to the dynamics and workings of oppression and the privation it causes necessarily?",0.5083,135
