"All i want to tell you is thank you. Thanks to you and your body positivity I managed to open a youtube channel, despite the fact I'm not thin.

I love your channel and every video you post!",0.9687,76

"Being fat is hard. Just as any other viewing of a persons identity. Ofcourse that is wrong, ofcourse what’s happening should be happening. But I’m glad your friend has some thick skin! This is going to not only uplift her but make her worth more valuable. Regardless if they’re talking about you or not, as long as they are you are doing something Great! She’s gotta keep her head up, this really could be a chance for her to voice her view. She has a chance to stand up for everyone else just like her. I hope she does it! 💜",0.9821,121
Body positivity is a good thing however if ur a size 0 or a size 100 covering up ur curves is more respectful to yourself and more positive than walking around half naked just saying...women and girls these days think showing off and leaving nothing for the imagination is a positive thing when in reality you are disrespecting yourself on so many levels,0.9537,65

"Excellent message. Honestly, I really thought you were going to mention how messed up it was that you joked about eating a bunch of chicken nuggets on Instagram and People jumped on you for “body-shaming” yourself and how it’s messed up that people just assume that a big person talking about food has to be negative in some way. Kinda disappointed you didn’t bring it up. You even used that particular post in the thumbnail.",-0.3197,86

"George Lopez is notoriously known for stealing jokes from less known comedians, in fact I heard a story how he literally stole a joke that was told outside moments later at a comedy club. So, am I surprised he would want to attach himself with a shitty meme repost... nah. He’ll probably claim he originally made the meme.",0.1027,66

"God bless you Loey. Been following your content for years now. Love what you're doing. You asked why 4 years ago body positivity was celebrated and its a joke now. Ive done a lot of thinking about that myself. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that the community has been cooped into the leftist ""progressive"" agenda. The movement has been politicized. And I feel like that SJW kind of culture is really falling out of fashion fast. I think its unfortunate that body positivity has been politicized. But we have activist liberals who cant help but think they must stand up for us because we are ""oppressed"" or something to thank for that. I know you don't say this, but just because im fat, doesn't mean im ""oppressed"". Im just fat. And there are plus sized conservatives too that need support and love, it all just sucks. It shouldn't be about politics, it should be about just being cool to people. 

My 2 cents.",0.9693,194

Hi Loey! I am a 14 guy who has bigger boobs than any of his classmates. I can't even be in a tight shirt because people make fun of me that i should wear a bra. I hope more people would watch this video and accept that some people have problem in thier life and can't choose what they will look like. I can't change that i have big boobs and i have acne and i am 6'2 and i look really weird next to my classmates but i am just another human person. I hope everybody who is reading this will be happy and loved and it doesn't matter if you are fat or slim.,0.9625,124
"I always feel insecure about being skinny. People used to ask me if I was Anorexic and always told me to eat. I'm slowly filling out which is good but I have a fast metabolism and it's not my fault if I'm skinny. 

I literally feel like you'll be bullied or harassed for being big, skinny, thin, fat or anything. You can't win. I just wish everyone was accepting no matter what body type, not just skinny and not just big. I love you Loey ❤",-0.9517,96

I don't even know what I would have done had my mockery been as wide scale and public as that disgusting meme. Truly heartbreaking and yet inspiring, it motivates me to remind those who are in my life that their bodies are beautiful and I wouldn't have them any other way!",-0.884,98

"I hate that that's a thing. I always see awful comments on videos or pictures that consist of a ""fat"" person. Or people make fun of someone who's barely overweight as well. You don't know what it does to a person, especially someone who has really bad self esteem. I was made fun of for being overweight, which at the time I was in a bad place, so of course it messed me up. I started starving myself because this stupid joke that went from pe to everyone else in the school. Even a year later people made fun of me. I wish there was a better society, but sadly this is our society. 

PS, I really love your videos ❤ I just never had the courage to comment /-\ Kay bye 😳",-0.623,150
"I hate this behavior. Why do people care how other people look? it's like they need to do it to feel proud. Because they might be skinny, but being fit doesnt mean as skinny as a stick. I dont care how other people look, but i also dont understand how people that probably dont notice that their ""comment"" offended many many people, write it anyways. I hate the word ""over weight"" because what does overweight mean? Is there a specific weight to reach? Ive never been so shocked on how people think that fat people are bad. Are they touching you or even making contact with you in any way to offend you? NO! So you dont need to say they are bad. If anything, they respect you and are one billion times better than anybody that says they are fat. At least they embrace their beauty and dont disrespect skinny people. They are their own person and you cant do ANYTHING at all to change them. I am disgusted by the social media community by starting this crap. I love you Loey for pointing this out. Keep on inspiring me.",-0.4479,216

Damn I did it, I went on a rant. Sorry.",-0.9118,110
"I have truly missed these types of videos ! And have felt my whole life the humiliation and shame of my own body, by seeing things on the internet, tv, memes and even my family. When I was young, I was big, and actually lost a lot around 18, I hadn’t seen my grandfather in 4 years and no one knew I lost the weight, and when he saw me, he said, “ wow, you’re cute now...” and even tho I was thin, I couldn’t help but to think to a man who practically raised me with my grandmother, so all that time when I was a little you found me ugly because of my body? Because of these types of comments and jokes, it really affected how everyone else outside my family treated me, and even worse how I allowed men to treat me as I got older. Took a long time to get passed, and sometimes still affects me.",-0.8352,188

"I think body positivity is not meant for fat people, ever noticed when a beautiful plus size woman has a picture posted, you will always find ""Stop Promoting Obesity!!"" commented below and liked several times. why does it bother people so much that a ""fat"" person dares to have confidence in their body, body positivity should include all bodies.",0.944,70
"I think it's kind of backlash to all the talk about body shaming and body positivity. As I think in the past we would have just been seen as freaks and ridiculous by default, but now more and more people are becoming aware that it isn't ok to laugh at - well, minorities in general. And not so long ago ""nobody"" had yet heard that fat people can live happy lives. Those who say the meanest things also often tend to be the loudest.",0.3983,92
"I think things are different now than they were four years ago because people are getting more ridiculous and being a victim is trendy. I've never seen somebody out right be rude to somebody just because of their size, that doesn't happen anymore because people just want to get on with their own lives and don't care really. But there are people who feel like if you don't want to date me then there's something wrong with you and you're a jerk. That's just not true it's a preference thing. I'm not saying that there aren't some assholes out there, there's assholes everywhere.",-0.7969,110
"I've always been incredibly underweight and told that i needed to gain weight however anytime i would put some on i'd get teased or have comments made about how i was carrying the weight and so i'd stop eating again and try my hardest to lose the weight again, i'm finally now at a weight that i'm healthy but i hate my body with how much i put on so quick, but that's only because i went from not eating and being so stressed out that my body was just eating away itself to eating and being happy.. My point of all of this is i'm not big but i'm still so ashamed of my body because of society, watching your body positivity videos, even though they aren't based around my body, they still help me so much, so thank you for opening up and showing the real truth behind body positivity instead of trying to say it's all rainbows and butterflies!",0.6906,170
I've always liked the bigger girls ever since I was a kid. Their so soft and fat 😘. I could cuddle all day long with a fat chick.,0.4215,31
"I've had the opposite experience. I for the longest time couldn't gain weight I was born with a lot of medical issues and couldn't hold onto protein or anything needed to gain weight. It made me feel like shit because girls who were thick were seen as better and I wasn't the kind of skinny girl that people noticed so I was so insecure for awhile. On the other hand my friends with ""not so attractive"" bodies would tell me I was lucky to be skinny. But no I was unhealthy. I have finally now been able to gain weight. Having my daughter recently changed my hormones and made it possible for me to get healthy. Now I'm 5'2 and 135 pounds before I got pregnant I was down to 100 pounds my healthy weight is 125 and I'm so happy to be over that. Love you Loey. Keep doing you fuck what society says. You're dope af!!",0.3448,174
"I've seen an abundance of the plus sized women I follow posting videos where they are visually upset and feeling angry that people keep making fun of them, and while I'm not plus sized currently I was at one point in my life and I was constantly bullied and made fun of because of it which has stayed with me now making me feel unworthy. It breaks my heart seeing Alex cry in that video over something someone said and it makes me mad that celebrities think it's funny to make fun of people they don't even know. I think it's important to keep talking about how all bodies are valued and worthy. FUCK anyone who rags on people for their weight. I don't care if you think it's ""advice"" people know how their bodies look, you can go home now.",-0.74,150
"If anyone is reading this,, I have been through so much recently with my weight and my skin and I just felt worthless. I have depression and anxiety and I have been judged for it but people who haven’t had that don’t understand and people never know what everyone goes through because everyone is beautiful but sometimes people don’t know that.if you are fat,thin,got acne,anxiety and other mental issues embrace it because that’s what makes you different♥️♥️",0.6858,98

"Just come on here after a long day, like a lot of the comments that I've just read, I've been feeling very insecure about myself recently as well. I love the fact that you can say that you're the same because at the end of the day in  reality you are a human with feelings just like us Loey!! <3 Watching you're videos about body positivity and self love and all of that is what opened my eyes and helped me to start accepting myself for who I am. Not that I stopped exercising. Because I didn't, but I have learnt that I am a larger individual and probably wont ever be completely stick thin because I have and I will be open because I feel safe commenting this here, I have ovarian cysts and that makes it that tiny bit harder for me to keep fit and up until this point in my life that I'm at now where I'm making healthier choices in my diet my eating habits have not been the best but even though I'm rambling and taking a massive detour from my point. My point is that I really needed to see this video and I completely agree with everything you said Loey, the way the world and internet looks at larger/fat people these days and the attitude it has towards us is disgusting. I've posted less and less of myself over the years as the internet has changed. But overall thank you for making this video. thank you thank you thank you so much <3",0.9817,277
"Just remember, Loey, people who choose misery tend to seek it in others, usually because they think they have some fault of their own & can't handle that self-imposed solitude. ""Misery loves company,"" right? The best WE can do is encourage them find the positive in themselves, so they will, hopefully, learn to recognize it in others. ❤️",0.8255,71
"K advice for all my frendos here who might be a lil or rly chubby. Here's what you gonna do. 
1. When someones comments negatively on what youre eating reply w ""How does that affect you?:)"" if they reply w the ""I just wanna help you"" bs  reply w a calm ""I appreciate it but i do not need your help. If i do in the future I'll let you know."" If they do wanna help cause theyre your friend reply w ""I appreciate it but what youre doing rn is not helpful. If you want to help me ask me first on how and I'll let you know""
If they are as dumb as to keep going in case these^ dont work stop talking and bring in your mind the ""ASSHOLE METER"". It is a great device only accessible in your brain in which you can rate ppl according to how much of an asshole theyre being. You can have your own scale too! 
And remember, what if youre a lil or rly chubby? There's more of you to love:)",0.9763,206

"Loey, I really needed to hear this. I remember the first time I posted a selfie on instagram, and there were so many downright rude people saying awful things about my weight (I was 13.) It really took a toll, and until I turned 19 (this year), I never posted another picture on the internet. I hate when nonfat people feel like ""fat"" is the only term to describe me. I'm an honors student, a writer, and all kinds of things. Why do people (even those who know me) think that I'm nothing more than fat. I hate it so much. I'm at a good place right now, but I haven't always been, and I wouldn't want to tear someone down.

And in watching your try on haul videos for plus size clothing, I realized that I too could wear cute clothes. Growing up I was always told what I could and could not wear because of my weight. But after watching your videos I realized it was up to ME. I bought my first crop tops this year. Being 20 I guess that’s kind of insane. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Omg!! Loey I love this! I’m a health coach after losing 42lbs myself.  I hear my clients say a lot that they are scared to go to the gym and making a change not just to look a certain way but just to take control of their health cause people will criticize and taunt them for working out and it breaks my heart!! You are so spot on! Love your body in every way you are and never  let anyone tell you you are not beautiful or handsome cause you don’t have the “perfect” body!! Hurting and taunting someone is never ok or funny!!,-0.9277,121

"Sadly fat shaming is the last acceptable discrimination there is. I don't know what the plus size community can do to turn this around. Every person cannot be 6 feet tall and 85 pounds. I think the fashion industry has a lot to do with this as most of the models are stick thin. I don't know how they can say Ashley Grahm is plus size, to me she is ""normal"". Why can't every woman see her self as being beautiful? With role models like the Kardashians that doesn't really help and all the young girls look up to that nonsense.  No one should be shamed whether there body size is large or small or no matter what color you are or if you have a handicap. It needs to change! I'm sorry Megan was so hurt. How can we band together and change things?? Sorry to rant but it's all hurtful. Sorry you were also hurt.",-0.967,174

"That is so upsetting to me. I've been overweight most of my adult life, and if someone did that to me, I don't know what I'd do :(  People like celebrities who have such a vast audience should NEVER post anything like this. People who look up to celebrities then feel ok to do the same thing. It's like Trump - he's a racist pig, and people now think well hey, if it's good enough for the President of the United States, it's ok to do the same.  Everyone is beautiful in their own way, and nobody deserves to be made fun of. Kharma will come back to bite these people on the butt!! xoxo",0.9441,128

"That’s disgusting. I can’t believe that someone would ever do that. We’re all humans and we’re all different for a reason. We are all beautiful and loved, always remember that. 💖",0.6597,44
"The fact that we, as a society, have normalized mocking my Renaissance beauty, full figured/curvy girls, (as if it's not bad enough that they dont have a plethora of pictures in and on covers of beauty and fashion magazines representing their beautiful selves; and not already struggling with insecurities, depression and suicidal thoughts) really breaks my heart. What hurts most is how people cannot fathom how much it hurts that people don't take my curvy girls seriously; to the point where they are not even seen as human. That infuriates the hell out of me. I'm not plus size, but I take personal responsibility in uplifting my Queens of all sizes. We're all royalty in my eyes 👸🏿👸🏾👸🏽👸🏼👸🏼💖",-0.7621,144

"The grass Is not always greener. I use to be heavier long story short I developed allergies and intolerance with a bunch of issues put me down for 3 years trying to figure it all out, I lost a ton of weight. I’m super under weight now and more insecure then ever so. It’s all about confidence and heath. As long as your healthy. And don’t have any health issues due to under or over weight then you are fine. It’s about vibes not skin.",0.7436,101

"The video of the girl dancing went viral last year, & then there was a story about her. The girl who was like 15 years old at the time has a brain disease. It disgusted me when people started making fun of her like that... & then to see what people have done with it & created this ridiculous meme. So disappointed in the world.

Humiliating them for our entertainment is disgusting. I love that you made this, thank you loey.",0.9182,83

This is where I don't feel many  comedians are funny anymore.  At all.  It's such a weird time where people are at war with each other and we don't even know them.  We don't know each others story and it would be so nice if this could stop.,-0.2896,52

"Unfortunately, we live in a society that articulates that big people are not good enough. When I was bigger I was the joke. Society treated me like I was a nobody. Sometimes people are obsessed with outer appearance that it makes their insides ugly. That's why I try to encourage young women especially the ones who are still in the stage where they are developing mentally to stay off of social media, because social media pushes out and unauthentic image that they define as beautiful. I'm very glad that the woman that this effected did not turn his emltions into sadness, but cyber bullying needs to end.",-0.6257,116

Well when you make videos about it to me it isn't raising awareess. The awareness is there...people are aware ...hense why it's spoken about so often . Don't like I don't speak about it . Negative or positive . It's not bringing awareness ...it's just making more people speak about larger people.,-0.096,58

"What i absolutely hate is that people just assume that when someone is fat they live unhealthy.. most of the time this isn't even the case.. some people get chubby bc of a sertain medicine they need to take.. some people just have it in their genes and can't help it.. and sometimes they even have an (mental) illness.. pls never ever judge somebody before knowing their entire story.. and even when someone loves to eat! Leave them be! It's not your body so stop saying mean things! (Sorry for the bad english, i'm dutch) i think everyone is beautiful size doesn't matter!❤",-0.7257,119

"You shouldn´t point out things about peoples appearences if they can´t fix it in ten seconds! ~ from tumblr, I don´t know the exact source though
I think this is an important measerument, even for people who are trying to be body positive. I don´t care if you think it´s funny how a person walks, how a person dresses, how a person looks when they are doing sports. People are not born for fitting in your standards of attractiveness. Chubby/fat people don´t need to be told to ""dress for their size"", tall people don´t have to not wear high heels, poor peoples clothing are not something to laugh about, a person in a wheelchair is not unable to participate in activities, a person who wears a lot of makeup is not worth less than a person with no/natural makeup, ... I could go on and on but the thing is: You can´t just assume someones personality by their looks, but I know you have disgusting character traits if you make fun of people or insult them.",-0.3792,214

"i get that obesity and being overweight should never be promoted, but these memes aren't making people aware of health issues, they are making people with these health issues seen as jokes and it's disgusting.
