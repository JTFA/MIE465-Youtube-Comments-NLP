"14) Hardin suggests that the commons be sold as private property... when his original allegation was that the tragedy of the commons is precisely because certain individuals were using resources as private property. This suggestion to move the commons perhaps to the hands of a small number of specific individuals is little more than feudalism when the history of feudalism is rife with civil unrest.
15) The intellectual dishonesty increases as pollution is discussed. Often it is government regulation that is supposed to keep ‚Äúrational thinking individualists‚Äù from polluting. See: oil spills, fracking, planned obsolescence, privatization of nuclear waste disposal, etc.
16) As a closing point about pollution, he says that population and technology calls for a redefining of property rights. This is interesting, considering the problem would diminish greatly if property rights were not a factor in the first place.
17) His next point is a falsehood concerning legislating temperance. He claims that a native american could kill a bison, take one part of its body, and leave the rest to rot. This is not what native americans did. native americans used most if not all of the body of their kills as a sign of respect to what we would see as the commons. ‚Äúhe was not of any important sense wasteful‚Äù is an obfuscation.
18) Hardin then goes in to the ecological systems of nature by offering the notion as a farce, then saying that the notion can only be understood in words. This is another obfuscation. Recently the wolves were introduced to Yellowstone. This meant that the sick herd animals were hunted down, which diminished their numbers such that a certain tree could flourish, which in turn beavers could return to yellowstone and use for dams, which fomented the return of a myriad system of rivers, lakes, and marshes rich and diverse with life. Hardin has no understanding of ecology, at least at the time of the writing of his essay concerning TotC.
19) As an end note about legislation, he speaks of corrective feedbacks. This is stark contrast to his denial of the solution to the problem that I stated in 2).",-0.9156,405

"8) Points out that zero growth is what qualifies a population as being non-prosperous, then states contradictorily that it is an unknowable fact whether or not the result of a positive growth rate is of an optimum capacity and purpose. No conclusion can be drawn from growth alone in a population.
9) Misappropriates Adam Smith's phrase ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù. That phrase was used as an argument against neo-liberalism. The choices of corporations to extract natural resources is not an ‚Äúindividual freedom‚Äù. Furthermore the idea of monarchist ‚Äúcorporation sole‚Äù is an intellectual dishonesty. If the decisions of the ruling class affect others, it's not an individual decision, it's coercive through the means of the state.
10) The example of everyone being a farmer seeking to make a gain is unrealistic and truncated. It assumes again that everyone is competing and that there is no reason for some of the population to take up other occupations. It is a false assumption that every human is as rigidly individualistic as a stereotypical merchant.
11) For each farmer to practice unsustainable infinite growth of their herd is symptomatic of unregulated capitalism, not gains for the public good.
12) He then goes on to say that individuals acting individualistically does damage to the common good. This is circular reasoning as anyone who takes the public good in to account will not behave like a stereotypical merchant, which would suggest central planning.
13) Hardin goes on to mention maritime law and the tragedy of the commons, when overfishing is directly from of lack of regulations and a purposeful business practices to make maximum profits as a function of time. This is the tragedy of the market, not the commons. It is also worth noting that kings and queens, who are corporation soles, do not travel overseas and across boundaries with a passport.",0.8643,341

"A significant percentage of corporate leaders and politicians today continue to fail to understand this concept. Every major challenge facing our species today is essentially a Tragedy of the Commons. Short term advantages are encouraged and celebrated by individuals at every level of modern society even if the long-term consequence is that our species (and many other species, too) goes extinct. 

For example, removing government regulations that prevent mining companies from dumping mercury, lead, or arsenic into the ground will have a short-term outcome of marginally decreasing overhead costs for a few companies by removing the need to spend money on hazardous waste disposal services and infrastructure. However, the long-term consequence of removing such regulatory law would be mercury, lead or arsenic leaking into groundwater aquifers, then into streams, rivers, eventually the ocean, and finally in the bodies of an entire generation of citizens who drank the contaminated water, consumed food grown near the contaminated water, or consumed fish who also ingested these chemicals. Blood concentrations of these contaminants will elevate over many years of ingesting small amounts. A generation or two later and the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as cancer, kidney-failure, birth defects, neurological deficits, and early deaths will drastically impact nations, health, quality-of-life, and eventually entire economies could suffer. 

Critical thinking and the ability to think in the long-term and about abstract concepts are essential mental tools that have to be learned throughout a person's life, growth and development. 

We must stop rewarding and promoting people who prioritize short-term financial gains over long-term human health, wellness, and economic stability. Other issues that are Tragedies of the Commons include human-induced climate change, nuclear arms proliferation, and growing international income-inequality. Videos like this one will help people learn how to think in the long-term, and I am always happy to see content like this on YouTube made available for free to everyone online.

"The TRIUMPH of the Commons:

Each fisherman is motivated to take as many fish as possible? Not so. People in tribes and small villages understand cooperation. They survive by only taking as much as they can eat. Why would a culture waste time and labor gathering more if it can't be used? This was recognized by explorers from so-called ""advanced"" societies when they discovered the more ""primitive"", ""stone-age"" tribes. Typically, due to the ability for the sea or ""commons"", as described, to supply food, the villagers spent their time in more productive endeavors, rather than a futile attempt to hoard rotting fish. Fish don't store. Hoarding takes time and labor. Fish are fresher when caught daily. The greater benefits of following social norms of the village are obvious to the villagers and only strange to the greedy and hoarding outsiders.

It is the uncooperative, hoarding ""civilized"" folk that come from the outside and try to take advantage of the good nature of the villagers. 

The video has a fallacy. The presenter assumes that villagers think like sociopaths and psychopaths. Where sociopaths are more common in the ""civilized"" cultures. 

Commons is normal in almost all stone-age societies. And they have been surviving nicely for tens of thousands of years. If there was such a fallacy in operation, then villages and tribes would have killed themselves off.

The story just describes the problems caused by unregulated anti-social, sociopathic behavior. The tribes and villages had systems in place to protect against that possibility, which was rarer in their culture anyway.

Because the ""civilized"" westerners had WEAKER protections against the sociopaths and hoarders, the assumption is made that the villagers and tribes also were so weak. Another logical mistake.

The tragedy of the commons has been called propaganda to support the taking of ancient lands from natives, ignoring that the natives had been living successfully together on the lands for thousands of years. Using the word ""tragedy"" in a context where it often is not, is propaganda and advocacy for a particular point of view. The tragedy of the commons is a projection of western and ""civilized"" culture problems onto other cultures.

It seems hard for western and civilized cultures to believe that other cultures have success with working together, co-ownership and sharing - such concepts are anti-capitalist and must be deemed ""tragic"". That's the REAL tragedy!

Too bad most people are so self-inclined they will of course see themselves as the good/fair person and everyone else as the selfish one.  You guys got any videos on how to recognize how we are all selfish and rude?,-0.875,61

"Very sad to see this video. remember folks, ideas kill and this video is certainly killing. the authors confusion of what is commons (communal property) and what is private fatally leads to terribly wrong conclusions. he even insinuates that taking antiotics is bad for mankind in the longrun! this idea that the needs of the many out way the needs of the few, when taken to its ends, always leads to genocide, famine and cataclysmic destruction of civilizations. the solution to the tragedy of the commons is just the opposite of ""take what you need"" the solution is obvious. privatization. each is responsible and suffers for the resources under his own keep. the degradation or growth of that resource owned by the individual will personally  hurt or reward that individual. any deviation from this system will kill without fail.",-0.9896,157

"We can then dig ponds and cultivate the fishes, making the farming biosphere to enlarge the commons wider while maintaining the balance.

"What do you mean common? Everybody suffer from it no matter how rich.
The poor will take as much water and food as they can.
The common will take as much extra food and stuff as they can.
The richer will take as much wealth benefits as possible.
The richest will take as much money and resources as quickly as possible.
They don't care about the longterm gain later, they want results now just look at the soviet union, Russia, India and America.
In Russia business men kill their people for more over the top profits.
In America business men cheat and lie as much as possible to get quick buck and increase their value and money.
In India business men want to take and sell resources as quickly as possible for profit like with Jadav Payeng's forest as he grew it for years and they saw profit in the trees so he had to stop them personally. Same with poachers wanting the animals coming to his island forest to eat and live so he has to fight them too.",0.9237,194

"Why Garrett Hardin's essay on the tragedy of the commons is an false premises

Attacking the source as an intro: Garrett Hardin was a grantee of the Pioneer Fund (Hardin is one who engages in genetic fallacy)
1) TotC was written in the 1950s, when technology was not what it is now
2) Pre-emptively rejects solutions to the problem of the tragedy of the commons out of hand.
3) Tic-tac-toe analogy is reductio ad absurdum, presupposes that all parties are competitors rather than cooperative allies.
4) Reiterates refusal to consider solutions by ignoring technological breakthroughs.
5) Posits that resources are finite, ignores resource management and renewable/recyclable strategies of energy production and waste removal.
6) Conflates research and development as a waste of work calories
7) States that incommensurables cannot be compared yet the ruling class can afford any such activity that consumes work calories mentioned before.",-0.9493,166
"Why are there so many delusional comments thinking that private property will prevent the tragedy of the commons? Private corporations are currently the biggest polluters on the planet. Exxon Mobile lied about climate change for decades so they could keep making profits and could keep polluting. Fossil fuel companies try to spend as little as possible on safety measures, leading to giant oil spills every couple of years and often threaten water supplies (just last year, 210.000 gallons of oil leaked in South Dakota). Privately owned cattle farms are the ones feeding them loads of antibiotics that we should really only use to save human lives.

Can any of you delusional capitalist apologists answer the following question: Why would a corporation with a fiduciary duty to their shareholders (this basically means they are legally obliged to maximize short-term profits) lower their profits to protect the commons? And if you can concoct a valid reason, why would this corporation not be out-competed by other corporations that don't protect the commons and thus are more efficient?

Private property and profit-driven thinking is the problem, not the solution.",-0.1801,202

"Yea but socialism has never worked... riiiight?

The greed of the few will ensure they are powerful enough to ignore the will of the many. The few have convinced the many that they should all ignore any idea that benefits anyone that can be seen as not contributing to the few's way of life.

This will not change in our lifetime. Greed has taken deep roots and the power of the few has grown to such proportions that even if every person on the planet gave up everything they had, it would not matter, as the few have much more than that due to their never ending greed.",-0.4958,116
