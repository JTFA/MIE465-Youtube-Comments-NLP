"Honestly never had a foundation match me EXACT like Fenty!! I don't understand why all brands don't specify undertones -- they'll  have 50 shades of pink in the light range and shades of orange in the darker range, if it exists (which has been my experience with Tarte complexion products). SMH at Tarte b/c this foundation otherwise would have been a HUGE moneymaker for them if they had a great shade range! Everybody loved the Shape Tape name! 

On the other hand, I still side eye Too Faced because if they needed help from Jackie to create darker shades, it means their entire team is white galore. That means they literally have no one in the company who is a person of color to help create shades. Really?? And they should reach out to their customers and ask them what kind of problems they've had with darker shades in other brands. They make it seem so hard to create, as if black people don't have undertones?? Y'all got hella money, there's no excuses.",0.9697,196

I am a fair skinned biracial girl (I have a black dad and a white mom) and even though I pass as white I have a extremely hard time finding a foundation that matches. So this was a slap in the face for someone like me who can go from an ivory shade to a caramel shade. I cannot imagine what this felt like for others,0.7558,70
I am so sorry that you have to go through this. I am disappointed in tarte and agree with you 100%. Tarte should be ashamed of themselves and not be so damn quick to release their foundation when they do not have a variety of shades to cater to deeper skin tones.  Your real reviews are so appreciated. Thank you 😙 💋😙,-0.1937,68

How do you provide a concealer with deeper shades but can’t provide a foundation that can match? Lol like I’m real confused.",0.6007,116

Ppl will complain about everything and anything . The foundation it's self isn't that good to be making a big fuss about.

We should not STILL be talking about brand inclusiveness in 2018, they have ZERO excuses, not with Fenty, NARS and a few others providing so many shades.
