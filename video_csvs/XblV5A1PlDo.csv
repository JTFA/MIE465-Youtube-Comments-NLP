"Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Another night I'm barely holdin' on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been livin'
All that's meant for me?

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

So I don't look down, I don't look back at all

I remember growing up listening to Three Days Grace and really loving their music. This new stuff is just shallow and corny to be honest. I have no problem with a new creative direction but when you throw your lead singer out like trash at least have the decency to change the bands name.,0.8292,57

"I usually don't comment but, man, this song is ass. And yes, we all know the band essentially died since Adam left - this singer is not as good. However, they did write one good song - Painkiller - (though it would sound better if Adam sang it) - but the rest were terrible. In summation, this song doesn't suck because Adam isn't singing it - it sucks because it is horrible. Sounds like a B-side of some Imagine Dragons rap pop: KEEP CLIMBIN THA MOUNTAIN!!  fuckboy music.",-0.9505,103

"Lyrics! [Intro]
Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain

[Verse 1]
Another night I'm barely holding on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been living all that's meant for me?

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still surviving, keep climbing
Keep climbing the mountain

[Verse 2]
The higher I go, the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still surviving, keep climbing
Keep climbing the mountain

[Bridge]
So if I'm not already too far gone
And if I feel a pulse then I can carry on
When I'm lost and wanna fade away
I tell myself to live, to die another day, yeah

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just surviving
Keep climbing the mountain
Even when I feel like dying
Keep climbing the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive and I keep climbing
Keep climbing the mountain, the mountain",0.9109,301

So, I was on my bus one day, coming back home from school, and there's this kid on the bus, let's say Bob is his example name, because I respecc privacy. Bob thinks he's a god at roasting, but Bob is very meh, sometimes it doesn't even make sense. Bob attempts to insult me by saying my hair is greasy and covered in dandruff more than hair, and then turns to yell at my friend because my friend kept annoying Bob by flicking the puff on his toque, (Canada, bitch!) and as he's about to tell him to ""Frick off"", (Lol Bob am babby) my friend yanks his hat off, revealing hair that _exactly_ matches Adolf Hitler's hair, and I say ""Well, you have the hair of someone who must've had grease and dandruff in their brain"", and he defensively puts the toque back on, slowly and awkwardly, now very quiet",0.7395,194
