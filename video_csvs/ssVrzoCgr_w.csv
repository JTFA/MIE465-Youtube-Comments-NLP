"There isn't a single woman - particularly in Alabama - that should stay quiet in response to Roy Moore's run, and what Brooks said (whilst trying to run away).  ""The Democrats are going to do damage to this country"" is HARDLY an acceptable response to being asked about the sexual harassment allegations against Roy Moore, and whether Brooks was going to continue to pledge his support.

Here's the message Brook gave: Which party has more power is far more important than the integrity & honour of those who serve this country - irrespective of party.  Oh, and never mind that we all CAME from women - they take a back seat to politics.

I'm just appalled.  All women would be, and so would more decent men.  Women of Alabama - Brooks message & Moore's behavior is aimed at you especially.  Rise up - speak out.  That's not a man you'd ever want as your boyfriend/husband ... never mind running your state!",0.8443,181

As for the kiss, they were rehearsing a kiss - ok he was a pig about it - another attempt at humor, a prank. This was an isolated mistake and he apologized. To equate Franken with Moore is not fair at all. Just compare their records as a legislator and as a person. Franken is a humanitarian; Moore is a racist, guntoting hypocrite.",0.1793,132
