Are the best the most hated, put down
Is it the bar they set
That whiners can't reach

A diamond soon to be fit
For a priceless ring
Lose its shine from a buffet
I know the night's dark but it's
Not quite finished, 
And the sun ain't up yet

That's hardly enough light you can follow
As time bleeds and
Life's leaving you blackened
