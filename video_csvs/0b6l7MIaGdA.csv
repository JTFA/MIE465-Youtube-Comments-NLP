"Congratulations Alabama.
America was able to watch the ""Trial and Conviction"" of someone ""Accused"" of a crime, as laid out by the most corrupt media known to man. We watched them lay out their case of ""Guilty before proven innocent"", that proved successful enough to get their guy elected by convincing you ,'the jury'. of his guilt. And by also causing those who may have voted for him, to stay home on election day. Because GUILT would not allow them to take the chance, just in case he may be guilty like the trusted media says.
   Then we got to see some of those celebrating this momentous achievement, Live on air, confess to coming with others from around the country to illegally vote in Alabama's election ""To get our boy elected"". And others claiming to get back in line to vote multiple times for Jones.
 Where was all the media coverage on that? 
So convince yourselves of taking ""The moral high ground"". And never stop for an instant to realize you were just ""SHEEP"" . Being used as a pawn. And not realizing that this election was decided for you, by those you so sheepishly follow. ...The Main Stream Media.",0.8802,235

"I am afraid that the celebration of the results of the Alabama Senate race is terribly premature.  Roy Moore has not conceded yet.  Once the right-wing media recovers from its surprise. it will begin churning out stories of voter fraud in Alabama, with lots of veiled references to the near unanimous black vote for Doug Jones.  Roy Moore will appeal the vote all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court will make him Senator, just like it made George W. Bush President in 2000.

I do not WANT to believe this will happen, but I did not want to believe that a creature like Donald Trump could ever be elected President either.  And Trump has already prepared the ground for Moore by all his talk of voter fraud in his Presidential election.

We are living in a post-Trump-election, post-Republican-majority-in-Congress America.  There is nothing Republicans in Washington will not not do to get their way.  They stooped to backing Trump for President.  They stooped to backing Moore for Senate.  Why would they not stoop to this?  As I said, they already did it for Bush in 2000.

Why do they do this?  Because they have been very well paid by the wealthiest individuals and corporations in America to believe that what is best for America is what is best for the concentrated wealth of America.  They view the people of America as being largely lazy parasites who, if given their way, would destroy America with Socialism, which they see as being equal to George Orwell's ""1984""",0.9574,285
