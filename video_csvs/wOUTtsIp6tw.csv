If you trained any animal properly it will leave the area when you point away. My dog is a hundred pound boxer/bulldog and I can leave a steak on the couch and walk away because she knows if she grabs it she's going to get her ass kicked. Raise them right from a young age with a strong voice and the occasional smack and you have a great large dog. ummm come to think of it its the same way you train another kind of bitch.,-0.1513,92
