Evolution has hardwired into our brains as a defense mechanism a preference for those who resemble us   What's important is the thoughts that follow this recognition.

"Can I just say how much I LOVE THIS VIDEO?! I'm Mixed Race. My mom (who is Indo-Carribean) is a beautiful brown and my Dad (who is Dutch-American) is a Creamy white. I am Olive/Tan complected (sidenote: Jackie girl, I feel you on the whole getting pale in the winter thing.) For people who grow up in a mixed race household, 'seeing' color is not a bad thing. Color is a daily part of our life. Having parents with two different colors, is and was my normal. Its only when you step into the world, do you realize your normal is not everyone else's normal. Like, when People make a surprised face when I tell them who my dad is. When I have to loudly say ""Dad"", whenever we go to restaurants and grocery stores without my mom, so people know I'm his daughter and not his 20 something girlfriend. The fact that I've had to explain my ethnic background to every person I meet since I was 5. And yet...I love my skin color. I love being apart of two cultures. I love that I have my dad's eyes and my Mom's coloring. I love my both sides of my extended family, who constantly told me, how beautiful me and my skin were. I grew up with people who were European, Asian, Pacific Islander, Black, Latinx and I got to experience their food and cultures. I grew up with two Amazing Parents who constantly supported and loved me. 

And yet, people still want to say ""I don't see color.""
 .......

I'm not going to lie. Even now it gets to me. I have spent my entire life seeing and being seen for my color. Their is nothing wrong with my or any one else's color. We are all enough, just the way we are. The problem is not our color but how the world perceives it. Trade in those negative preconceptions for love and understanding and I think we can all get along just fine.",0.9803,394

I hate being asked “Oh you’re colorblind? What color is this?” I know my colors like it’s not hard for me to identify them. I match my own foundation, I can see the difference in shades.

"this is why i when i start doing make up on clients i want to get brands that include everyone all skin types,no one should  be a after thought ever. brands need to open their eyes and realize that their are more skin colors out their besides white. everyone should be able to participate in make up or things in general in life. even though i don't know the struggles of being a woman of color, i do feel strongly that no one should be left behind. i agree with you jackie that if you cant produce for everyone then dont put out the product until you can fully. i was taught to love everyone and i am going to keep doing.",0.8406,131
