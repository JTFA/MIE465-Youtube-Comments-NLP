"A thought about the already condemned. It seems that for many years he suffers from a mental disorder, his pedophilia, that he has not known or that he has not been able to remedy. This has been tragic for his victims, and does not exempt him from responsibility because he can differentiate between good and evil. For him it has been the greatest of tragedies, to ruin a successful professional career in this way, which consisted precisely in helping others and not in hurting them, being marked forever by shame, being expelled from human society, dispossessed of his belongings, blocked for life as an animal, having lost his own family; I also think about the tragedy that it represents for his wife and children, the shame and sadness that will always accompany them. I can not look at an image of the condemned and avoid thinking about a living dead, in fact, I think he is going to commit suicide in prison. It was like attending an execution, which a perpetual sentence looks like. A tragedy for everyone, on the first place for the victims, of course.

I'm not too familiar with the judicial system, but isn't a judge supposed to hear both sides, then make a judgement, throw the monster in jail forever and case closed. I'm afraid there might be a re-trial, not now, but in 2-5 years when people come down from their emotional rollercoaster.  No question he is guilty, specially with over 100 women/young girls testifying with heartbreaking stories. But there must be law and order inside the court.

And this guy reminds me of how well my abuser played victim to the point he was free of punishment and I was the one blamed instead. At that time, people did nothing to help me and even labeling me as the demon. Abuse is scary and it's something nobody deserved to.

"Watching at 1.25x speed decreases the intensification of what happened by 1.25x. It makes the Judge's statement seem 1.25x less standing, makes the defendant's sentence seem 1.25x shorter and shows that you can't comprehend the reality of the situation unless it's downsized 1.25x. Only watch this at 1.25x speed if you can't process the Judge's remarks in full. It makes sense, though. I wouldn't expect everyone to be prepared to even hear this situation.",0.296,87

I don't think it is as much feeling bad for the one who preyed on all of those children and young people as it is feeling bad for his family.

I actually think, putting myself in her place, that after hearing over a hundred horrifying testimonies that would be kinda unhuman not to feel anything or have nothing to say to this guy. And just to prove you are right, my first comment was a test, if you scroll down, there was a guy who commented exactly the same as me, only that with a different # cause he commented early, guess who's comment was the guy commenting here picking on?
