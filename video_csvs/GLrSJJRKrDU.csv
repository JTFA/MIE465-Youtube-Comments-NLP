"Deaf dogs rock. My husband and I adopted two. One passed away last year at age 14 yrs., but the other we still have. They make great companions as long as you're willing to gesture commands to them and keep them leashed when outside a confined area for their safety (Can't hear approaching cars, or call them back). Perk, they don't bark when the doorbell rings and most of the time you can come home, unpack the groceries or whatever before they even  know you're home.",0.8847,98

For everyone commenting about how he amputated leg without even trying to save it there’s a lot that we don’t know we didn’t see the x-rays so we can’t judge. He’s a vet he knows what he’s doing even if he did try to fix the leg it would probably require more medical attention later on in life maybe even amputation later on. When she gets older it would be arthritic she was way happier after the leg was amputated.,0.765,95

Hi everyone!!! Just wanted to remind you that dogs do fine with three legs!!! Don’t equate how you would feel without a leg to how a dog feels!!! They’re dogs!!! They’re fine so long as they can move around pain-free!!! Which they can with 3 legs!!! And!!! They adapt better to having 3 legs than trying to use prosthetics!!! And vet ranch doesn’t have unlimited funds here!!! The dog is fine!!!,0.816,109

"I wish you had tried to save her leg :(  since she was so young.   You could always amputate later if it didn't work out.  Not judging you Dr. Dave, but every animal deserves the benefit of the doubt, unless you are factoring $ into the equation.",0.4118,53
I'm puzzled honestly.  I've seen so many videos here of dogs with shattered bones and they managed to save the leg(s).  And those weren't a guarantee either.  I understand this option made sense and would be the common solution for the average owner with low funds but I guess I would've liked to see at least an attempt since Vet Ranch does have the funds thanks to many donations.  Sadly disappointed :(,-0.5747,79
"I'm reading some of these comments like. ""Why do you always rush to amputate instead of trying to repair or rehabilitate the appendage? ""

It so happens that most of the animals that come to Vet Ranch have an issue with their limbs that require it to be amputated. You retards don't understand, Dr.Dave said that it would take 6-8 weeks to repair the leg meaning that the Puppy would be constantly given medicine and antibiotics. Dr.Dave amputated the leg to get things done fast and to ensure that the Puppy would have a good quality life. Dogs do not have an emotional attachment to their limbs. 10 days to recover a lost limb instead of 4 months? Dogs only have 10-13 years of life,  4 months of waste going to a limb that the dog could care less about. If you're not a Veterinarian, then don't say stupid shit.",0.9172,163
I'm unsubscribing - the dramatic music is unbearable. Will check back in a few months to see if it's changed. All the best to you,0.6369,27
"I've watched a few videos now where pups had limbs that needed to be amputated. my question is this: how come they take the whole leg (all the way up to the shoulder or hip), as opposed to leaving the good parts of the limb for the dog to make do with? clearly it doesn't slow them down very much, but it's just a point of curiosity. thanks! (note: i'm not criticizing or doubting the decision to amputate, just wondering what informs the decision on *how much* of the limb to take).",0.9034,108

"Listen guys, from what it sounds like, it would have been like going to the hospital because you are a small child who can barely walk and with what you can it HURTS and they give you two options-1. You go through multiple surgeries which had a risk all in its own, constant bed rest, pain through out, and IT MAY NOT EVEN WORK and the long term care that it may come with and the possibility of more surgeries and pain in the future. OOORRR 2. You can simply have the deformed leg removed so you can go on living you life as soon as possible. Dogs with three legs life good healthy lives and minor care for the supporting leg is needed. I believe it was a good call. Please stop trying to put these amazing people down for things you don't understand. Ask questions or learn about this issue before spouting off criticism. They thought of the dogs long term happiness over what a perfect dog would look like. She is a sweet heart and I hope she finds somewhere who will care for her. Great job and sorry for all the hate. <3",0.9851,215

"There are a lot of factors that play into whether surgery would be effective or not. I don't know the situations of other videos where they did work to save the leg, but in this particular case I'm sure Hope's age was a large variable. 

Since she's a pup, she's going to be growing for 1 to 2 more years. Even if they had a successful surgery now, there's not guarantee that they wouldn't have to go back and do more as she grew. If more surgeries would become necessary, you never know what other complications could arise.

Obviously, you don't want to have the dog suffer with living with the deformity until she's done growing, because that would definitely interfere with the puppy lifestyle in general.

Amputating at this young age allows her to better adapt to the missing limb, and for her muscles to grow, and better develop, on her remaining leg to make up for the missing limb.",0.9307,177
