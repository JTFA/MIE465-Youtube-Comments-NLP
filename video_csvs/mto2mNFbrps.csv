"Great idea for a 15-sec video.  I love the music and the storyline.  The thud almost made me feel the blow of the stone on the back of my head and I cringed at it.  My only remark is that a tad bit too much ""liveliness"" came through from this sweetheart of a girl, so I didn't believe she was actually the one who died in the otherwise gruesome video of her death.",0.7861,82
