"Oh my gosh. I've finished. I've always been a crash course fan. I used to binge watch the history and literature seasons, and of course my teachers would use them for lessons. Eventually, YouTube began suggesting Vlogbrothers content to me. I watched a few videos, and they were good, but it was so nuanced and there were so many inside jokes, and the community was so tight knit that I  figured I couldn't fully enjoy the content unless I understood everything. So i went back to January 1st, 2007. And as of today, I have watched every vlogbrothers video to date. In such a short time I have learned so much about humanity and myself; I have hope in the world again and a renewed vigor in trying to better it. I learned that it's ok to be unabashedly passionate about things and to be silly and think  profoundly all at once. I am happy to have found such a  unique corner of YouTube, and hope that I can count myself as part of the community.
These guys are good men. Since the beginning they have done everything they can to help people less fortunate. They have 3 million subs, but only average a couple hundred thousand views.
