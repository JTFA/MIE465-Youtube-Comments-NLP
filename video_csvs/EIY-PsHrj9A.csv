"Everyone, including Mark Hamil, seem to be forgetting that Ep 8 is the end of Luke, Han, and Leia's arch. Much like how Return of the Jedi was the end of an arch. After Return of the Jedi we had the prequels, the animated TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, comics, books, and everything in between to help bridge the gaps in the storyline. Things will make more sense years from now, it seems so jarring to us because we are watching THE END of the story and not THE MIDDLE. Imagine an animated series revolving around Luke, Han, and Leia a few years after Return of The Jedi! That would be amazing and certainly we could see why Luke has changed so much after 30+ years.

I also have to disagree with Mark when he says ""Luke would never give up."" The theme of the movie is reaction to Failure. Luke's reaction to failure was to let nature take its course. He even says in the movie that The Force doesn't belong to the Jedi and that there is always a cosmic balance regardless of what he does. 

However, it's his convo with R2D2 that puts thing in perspective for him. R2 shows him the original message Leia sent which convinces Luke that if he lets nature take its course he could still lose his sister. Yoda even tells him that he could lose Rey; while The Force would still compensate and find someone else to manifest ""The Light Side"" in, it wouldn't be Rey and it wouldn't be Leia. That is ultimately what changes Luke's mind.

"Glad that Mark Hamill was brave enough to speak out at this time when the corporate machine of Disney and their allies are out defending their profits by stifling all dissent against this movie. Rather than accepting that many of the fans' criticisms are valid and rational and then addressing them, it seems that instead, any dissenting voices are branded ""overly emotional/subjective"" or even ""racists who are ""against the inclusion of women/people of color"". While I am certain that there are some nasty racists and overly invested people amongst the critical voices, these only seem to be a tiny minority. On the contrary, most criticisms I see are shrewd observation about poor writing, plot holes and inconsistencies in the writing. Very inconvenient for the corporate machine who, as they are unable to deny these observations, must unfairly brand the dissenters extremists in order to protect profits.",-0.659,168

"I disliked the movie.
There was no real (measurable) character development, hope, or good writing. The important character development barley occurred in the last movie.
This destroys the general perceptions of good and evil. There is no last Jedi (Unless Rey dies without teaching any Jedi).
The movie kept trying to push hope but did nothing evoke that feeling by betraying the characters at every turn.
Starwars has always been an easy to understand story with definable good and evil.
Now it's a mess that reflects to much on real life perspectives issues and does a piss poor job at doing that.
Luke, Leia, and Han fought a real tyranny and won, but none of that hard won effort was rewarded in these last two movies. It's just disappointing trash now.

"I just keep going back to the fact that this Luke didn't feel congruent with the Luke Skywalker of the OT. In my mind everything in this movie hinges on us believing that Luke would step back from the fight...that he'd in essence ""give up"" on the possibility of redeeming his nephew and protecting his friends. That doesn't jive with Lucas' vision of Luke. Everything that Luke did in the original 3 movies was in service of his loved ones, not just his own pride and his own legendary status.

Luke was arrogant, like his dad. He was prideful like his dad. He was impulsive and ""wreckless"" according to Yoda, but he NEVER turned his back on his family or friends. His primary character trait was one of optimism and hope. The fact that TLJ paints him as a washed up depressed hermit who wants to crawl under a rock and die instead of fighting for his friends and family is completely antithetical to how the character was conceived and portrayed in the OT.

I actually like TLJ. I think Johnson made an amazing film at points. He didn't pay off JJ's mystery box, and he didn't need to. But Luke was always above reproach. I'm with Hamill on this one. I didn't buy it. Maybe I'll come around to Johnson's point of view eventually, but I'm not convinced. I've had a certain vision of Luke in my head for 30 years.

"I thought 7 was great but found a lot of problems with 8... it was entertaining, but I didn’t think there was anything in there that answered any of the questions the fans were asking for the pas 2 years waiting for this movie...

Who is Snoke?  
Who is Phasma?
Who are Rays parents?  Well... they answered that question but it felt like such a “troll” answer that left you feeling unfulfilled.

There were a ton of opportunities for good story telling and all they did was cut ties to create something new.  I get that but it was very disappointing.

I didn’t think they did much relationship building... Finns whole point of this episode was get back to Rey and when he did... big hug, then he’s off doing something else. Not only that, but nothing he did actually made any difference when it’s all said and done... he could have not even been in the movie and nothing would have changed.


Also, I’m sad they turned Luke into such a wimp... a quitter... my childhood hero couldn’t even bother to go to the mineral planet himself when the end result would have been the exact same thing.

Hopefully they can make it all right in 9. 

Sorry Mark... they did you wrong.  Your performance none the less was stellar.",0.7876,260
"I thought the film could have been better with Yoda talking to Luke at the beginning  and appears now and again than just 1 scene! Han Solo should have been united with Luke, chewie, Leia,  and the rest to make the story fit better.

"I understand that Mark is upset that Luke is different, but as he pointed out in the video, he has to be. He's no longer the main character of the story. His role has shifted from protagonist to mentor and because of that, his character needed to change. If the character of Luke hadn't changed the film would have had two conflicting protagonists which would have created the same problem that the DCEU movies had, too many plots and not enough character development. Also, while Luke may not have given up in the first trilogy, he's had his life ripped apart just as Yoda had his life ripped apart before A New Hope and the idea of Luke hiding and being found by a young Jedi trainee is the same as when Luke found Yoda.",-0.7992,146

The Poe and Resistance running out of gas AND the Finn and Rose (please kill her off) pointlessly going to space casino and serving nothing to the story were terrible wastes of time.

I feel like he very mush disrespected the tone and the tone of the original sequels. It felt more like one of the prequels to me, which is a shame. In the end, it is just a movie, but it is sad to see how they ended these classic characters. Probably best to not go back to the well, and to just launch a new set of characters.

After TFA I actually liked Rey and her Marry Sue-ness, that was fine.  Kylo was/is a little bitch but that's fine, were catering to the new millennial crowd that likes that shit (after all we cant have old gravitas actors in leading rolls anymore, at least not without making them look foolish).
It basically comes down to this:
TFA/TLJ are designed for people who either never seen SW before or the really young new generation of fans that never grew up with either the OT or PT.
Disney's inclusion of all is fine, I'm not angry about that.
Yoda and Obi-wan did not give up!  Ben's mission after the PT was to safeguard Luke and then to hopefully bring him to Yoda who was keeping himself on the Down-low so that he could train Luke in the future.  These guys were playing a long game, not giving up.
The dialogue in this movie did not feel like star wars.  It felt like what we would say in real life.  Not the ""You can write this down in the Script but you can't say this shit."" That we got in the OT and PT.  Why is that?  Because George Lucas didn't want it to feel like day to day talk, so it gave the movie a certain feel.  That feel disappeared with the dialogue in this movie.
Luke character was raped and de-emasculated for absolutely no reason except for the ""The old must die so the young can grow and be their own person."" Trope. 
Dreadnought is surrounded by Star Destroyers.  That sit back and do absolutely nothing.  No air defense, no cover fire, no ECM, no launching of their own Tie Squadrons to help their high value ship out.  Nope. They just sit their looking impressive.  Doing nothing.
The holding for general Hux gag...OMG, blow that fucking x-wing up already.   He's sitting there waiting. shoot him down already.
You can got to hyperspace and kill a Super Star Destroyer in a suicide move, um.....ok, you had 2 earlier attempts that you could have used the medical frigate or that corvette to do that with.  Tell one of the droids on board to pilot the ship to goto hyperspace and blow that SSD up. 
So so many plot holes in this movie that the one redeeming thing they could do.  The easiest thing they could do, was have Luke show up in person in his fuking X-wing and give us a last stand OP as fuk Luke Skywalker and do what he did, in person with a slightly longer saber fight with Kylo and still have Kylo swing and have Luke become one with the force.  Nope.
We get Rey instead coming in to save the day, and a Luke that dies due to over-exertion.

Ben and Yoda exiled themselves after failures, yet they all returned in their own way. Luke's way was original and captivating, and that is great for a movie.",0.8702,109

Probably grateful by that time for anyone to buy the fucking property.....   Now they have....  Well look how that's turned out for you!!!.....      You slagged off   TFA  saying it was another re-hash of A New Hope.... Then you all said....  Fucking Disney they better give us something different in the next one or I'm done.....   Rian Johnson gives you something different....  YET YOU STILL SLAG THE GUY OFF SAYING YOU WISH HE DIED ETC.... Come the fuck on.... It's not the 1970's anymore.... Franchises have to grow and move on....  I can see why they gave him a new trilogy... maybe just maybe he will do better with fresh ideas and fresh characters.....

"Ok I have a problem with people saying that people change in time and that means the change of character in Luke is justified. And I have to say, this is a movie, a story with established characters and you can't change them all of a sudden without showing how and why they changed. That's why I just don't buy it when I see Luke trying to kill his own teenage nephew and then going into hiding for 20 years.  Because that's not how he was established the last time I saw him.
Look, there are many flaws within this movie and Luke is just a small drop in the ocean but I feel that they could have still made the same movie without fucking the character over. 
For example, imagine that it was Han and Leia that suggest that Luke should kill Kylo (because both have been tortured by Vader and they never saw the good in him therefore knew the dangers in having a child and were prepared to face the consequences) but Luke having overcome the dark once before absolutely refuses and instead goes on to train Kylo in a very strict way but in doing so he accidentally triggers the dark side in Kylo (like with the mirror which could then draw a nice parallel between Rey and Kylo) and Luke is faced with failure and goes to exile a broken man, explaining the change in character. Then Luke trains Rey and when he sees her taking off to try to save Kylo and doing what he should have done before, Luke is inspired (and the teacher becomes the one who learns) and decides to go after Rey and try to save her and Kylo himself. Then he confronts Kylo (in the flesh!) and refuses to fight letting himself be struck down (to then become more powerful than he could possibly imagine) and in doing so gives the rebels time to run. And the dice could have been real btw. 
And that's just off the top of my head. There must be even better ways to write Luke in this movie but this is only to show that it could still be the same movie changing nothing but Luke's character. Still would be a poorly written movie nonetheless with many flaws but that one would be addressed.",-0.9543,420
"Really they should have made a trilogy of the Yuuzhan Vong or the Thrawn Trilogy as episodes 7,8 and 9. I enjoyed The Last Jedi much more than the Force Awakens which was too Disney-fied and a rip off of Ep 4. This was darker and that helped to counterbalance the last film. If they really wanted to show a Luke apprentice gone bad, then they should have gone with the Solo twins and incorporated them into a trilogy surrounding the Yuuzhan Vong or the Thrawn, not rewritten it all. I get they did this trilogy to amalgamate ideas from the EU which was messy in parts, but don't bastardise it entirely.
I see what Marks saying but I quite liked his portrayal in TLJ, his powers were cool too. I just wish it was actually Luke and not a force projection against Ren",0.9204,154

"Rian was indeed the exact man that they needed for this job.  I hated George Lucas' direction with a universe that had such power and potential.  It was always missing that human element and Rian found it and inserted it into The Last Jedi perfectly.  Jedi, in the end, are only human and subject to emotional and ethical turmoil.  Mark here says that Luke would never have given up in George's version.  That's what made it all unbelievable for me, because real people give up.  Real heroes are flawed.  Real heroes rise above those flaws and risk everything when the moment arises.  That's what happened in The Last Jedi.  That's what made The Last Jedi such a human story and much more believable.",0.7579,137

They then try to cover this up by showing how progressive they are by making the new main character a woman (A Mary Sue at that), give her a bunch of minority sidekicks, make all the bad guys white and then hope no one pays attention to how laughably bad the plots are because of ""Muh Diversity"".
