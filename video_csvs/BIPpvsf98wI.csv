"Yea I also saw it... but idk, I think The Host is one of the few times where she was persuaded into doing a project (probably for the commercial appeal considering the author wrote Twilight), in the sense that it didn't come from her intuition, and so her acting there somehow felt stiff and overly framed, not as natural as one would expect based on her past works. Or maybe she was first inspired by the idea of the film, and chose to join, but the direction and the screenplay were so, how to say it, generic, so her expressions and acting in the movie came out generic as well, nothing truly noteworthy and unique like her performances in other works I listed.

I highly recommend watching her DP/30 interview on Lady Bird, where she speaks on the necessity of being intuitively oneself, which she touched on during previous interviews with DP/30. She's really one of a kind.",0.9461,181
