"From Snopes, in regards to the ""Chinese eat babies"" misconception:

""The man ... was not a restaurant patron enjoying a common Taiwanese dish, but Chinese performance artist Zhu Yu, who staged a conceptual shock piece called ‚ÄúEating People‚Äù at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000. Maintaining that 'No religion forbids cannibalism, nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people,' Zhu Yu acted out a performance in which he appeared to eat a stillborn or aborted child and said that he 'took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it.'""

While it's not known if the fetus was real or not, the photo was taken for the purpose of shocking other people as art; it wasn't some random guy eating at a restaurant. Eating fetuses has never been and never will be a trend in China or any other part of the world. In fact, the closest any country has gotten to such a thing was when eating placentas became a brief new age trend in the United States. 

In regards to the bear thing, different cultures have different views on what is and isn't ""okay"" to eat, and there's a considerable number of cultures that view Americans as barbaric for their consumption of foods such as beef and pork. And on that whole ""whatever they get their hands on"" thing, that statement alone is filled with so many demeaning misconceptions that I don't even know where to begin.

But you don't care about that, do you? All you care about is what justifies your blatant racism towards Asians, because to you, these people (assuming you even consider us people) shouldn't be alive on the same planet as you.",-0.9638,329
