"Can't help but wondering if this
Is the last time that I'll see your face
Is it tears or just the pouring rain?
Wish I could say something
Something that doesn't sound insane
But lately I don't trust my brain
You tell me I won't ever change
So I just say nothing
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone, I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back
I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh
'Cause you know every morning I wake up
Yeah I still reach for you
I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know even when I say I've moved on
Yeah I still dream for you
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone, I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back
You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
Yeah I still dream for you
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone, I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know I will never get over you
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back

"This song reminded me of my old self.

The one who's obsessed with 5SOS and loves them with all her heart.

I'm so disappointed in myself, because I didn't wait for them. 

My heart got attracted by someone new. BTS.

And I did not regret any of that.

It was nice being a fan of them. I've actually never been this happy.

It's just that I was so in love with someone and I forgot the ones who was there for me since the beginning.",0.9524,95

Can't help but wondering if this
Is the last time that I'll see your face
Is it tears or just the fucking rain?
Wish I could say something

You tell me I won't ever change

And all I have to do is watch a compilation of your guyses funny moments. And I will brighten again. You guys mean so much to me, even though you don't even know me. But that doesn't matter because I still know that you care. You care about all of your fans and that is amazing. This is such a nice song as well, I love it. It's so modern and I can't wait for the video. Thank you so much, and I hope you are all happy with which I know you are.  <3",0.98,131
