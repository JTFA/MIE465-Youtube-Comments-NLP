I have never seen the like.

Or maybe  like the story of Carl Loeffler, the math professor who developed 6000 combinations for the game of bingo so there wouldn't be multiple winners, but went bonkers as a result of his mental exertions...or so I'm told.

So precise. So harmonious. So exacting. If the universe consisted of this single routine, support for Intelligent Design would be unanimous.",0.8805,141
