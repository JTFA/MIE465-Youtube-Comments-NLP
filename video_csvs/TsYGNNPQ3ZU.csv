"Dear Mitch grassi,                           
          I want you to know how you have changed me. Watching you preform gives me the confidence to also be myself. I realize having my own different style truly is beautiful. I no longer hide myself in hoodies but instead wear the most impractical crazy heels just to go to school for no reason other than it makes me happy. I am happy to be able to tell you I now feel beautiful. I feel perfect. I just wish you know you are the cause of that. 
       
         I idolize you. I would love for you to know how much I look up to you. I‚Äôm now confident enough to even try out for solos in my school chorus and I even get them sometimes. You‚Äôre truly life changing to me. I feel my voice is beautiful too along with myself. I watch you sing and it teaches me how to hit the notes you also hit. I also have trained myself to sing in the whistle range. It may not sound that great yet and might not be very controlled, but it‚Äôs a start. Because of you. 

          Thank you for being you. Continue doing so please because it may depend on some people being happy or not. You inspire me to the fullest. Thank you. 

                              Caroline",0.995,247
