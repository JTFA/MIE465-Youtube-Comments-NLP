Yo you are amazing,0.5859,4
Yolanda - I wanna know something. I always see you apply fondant and then throw the entire cake straight back into the cooler. Do you ever have an issue with condensation on your fondant? Do you have something happen that people might refer to as melting fondant? What are your rules to putting fondant on cakes and putting them in cold environments? You put fondant on cold cakes right? Would you ever put fondant on a frozen cake? After it is covered do you only put it in a fridge or do you ever put it in a freezer? Do you suggest never freezing fondant? If you have condensation and “melting” is there a fix? Let me know everything you know about these issues.,0.4864,137
