These are inner-city hospitals with very low budget who can barely afford to keep the doctors they have on staff. These homeless people come in every day with a different malady, often self-inflicted, and all resources used on them cannot be used anywhere else.

No. This is the system we force them to exist in, if we want to fix this problem, we have to fix this system.

As for the cost of health-related care, we must hold our government accountable for big pharma inflated costs via their lobbyists bombarding members of Congress with fat perks and pockets. The outrageous prices for procedures and medication while being hospitalized is also a factor. In addition, the corruption by doctor and practitioners billing further squeezes the resources. So, we end up paying regardless of the homeless or working poor.

Those of us that are not apolitical or care whether we are (D) or (R) or whatever should be the foot soldiers for the least of these by not just standing by but engage our elected officials. We never know if it going to be our family or us next.

"Sorry, tankie. that was an earlier, simpler era. The doctor, whichever of the ""hospitalists"" who was on shift, probably wrote the order to send pt to skilled nursing, or some similar place. He or she likely wasn't even the one admitting the patient and may not even know her name beyond a wrist band. The work of finding a place is left to ""discharge planners"" who face a gauntlet of criteria based on corporate arrangements between the hospital and step-down facilities. The doctor would be focused on only the clinical details of her medical condition and faces pressure by MBA types as to how to even make his or her rounds and how much time they are allowed to spend on each patient. He or she may not have even been in the hospital when this occurred. And certainly wouldn't have been consulted about the discharge details.",0.3612,164

"THIS is Obamacare. When Michelle Obama worked as an attorney for a Chicago hospital earlier in her career, one of her jobs was to steer homeless people AWAY from hospitals and towards free clinics. Based on this 'progressive' agenda, it's not such a leap to believe that efforts were made by Mrs. Obama and others at the hospital where she worked to discharge poor patients ASAP or steer these people towards so-called 'free' clinics. Mitchell Obama's job was to keep the best interests of the HOSPITAL--not the patients--at the forefront.
Perhaps Obamacare today was modeled, in part, by using the strategies employed by Michelle Obama and others back then.",0.7506,123

"The horrifying fact is that it's going to get much worse.  When the world is based on contracts, and paper is more valued than a life,  souls are signed over.  Only one entity I know of requires you to place your mark on contracts.  To give over conrol of the spirit and the vessel of that soul. The mark of the beast is simply a signature, or sign, and the mark on the contracts are first on our foreheads. Until ALL conracts are FORGIVEN,  and cast into the firey pit of salvation,  the beast of bondage shall reign supreme.  We all bare the mark. We wield our signatures as a sharpened sword in a vein attempt to gain for self and not for the greater.  We look to the back of our right hands with eyes that were given sight to bare witness to both the truth and lies.  We dive into the beast of numbers at a moments notice and give it faith and love whilst true love receives cold abandonment.  We feed our flesh and starve our souls.  Broken promises to God and open contacts with the Devil, it's no wonder to me of the state we're in.  A contract by nature assumes powers over the natural. We've gone from our brothers keeper to our brothers jailer.  I can go on with this , but what's the point.  The word no longer has meaning, and contracts will continue to be ACCEPTED.

"The hospital expressed ""shock"" at the fact that security guards dumped this patient out on the night streets in 30-degree temperatures, and wearing little except a bed sheet-thin, open-backed hospital gown and a pair of socks? Someone ORDERED these guards to remove this patient; and I doubt any nurse, doctor, aide, or orderly had the authority to do that.
Administration had the authority to order hospital security to remove this patient, and for what, I do not know. Such a scenario is something one might expect to see in a communist or dictator state and NOT the United States of America.
For any hospital to treat patients--especially those that cannot speak or are otherwise unable to care for themselves--in such an inhumane way is contemptible beyond expression.
As I watched heroic videographer Imamu Baraka ask the patient if she's alright and then hear her respond with plaintive wailing, I broke down and cried.
