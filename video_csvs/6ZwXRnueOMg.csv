Not sure if this is just my cat and our relationship but he used to sit up infront of me on the desk and then not directly making eye-contact but looking at me with HUGE dilated eyes. Its like he was guilty or knew he would get in trouble for what he would do next... if I tried to move my hand onto the desk or even pat him he'd bite me really bad. Then of course I'd yell and he'd run off and I'd be grumpy and he'd be grumpy. Literally took me over a year to realise he did this whenever he wanted food/treat. I didn't want to reward him for his negative behaviour of picking on me (youngest and smallest target of the house) so I'd shoo him out of the room then wait a short time until I fed him again. Not sure if its worked but he hasn't done it since (tho he is pretty old now) I think I just finally realised how to read his body language since he doesn't meow much,-0.5139,191
