"Notable informations you omitted in your video : 
1. The saber has to slide over the bottle seam (your fizz bottle may not have one, but the champagne has. If you miss that, you'll break the bottle in an horrible fashion)
2. You need to observe a 45° angle so the blade is going to hit with more cutting edge power (you are not brushing the bottle with a file)
3. You dont need to start your swing so far near the bottom of the bottle if you followed 1 and 2 (more stronger and faster you hit, more risk of spilling the content on impact too, dont be a brute). You can swing starting from the shoulder (that's the name of the curve before the neck of the bottle). Plus, some bottles have a deep curve making it too steep to follow from the bottom to the finish. And it's quite, inelegant. 
4. The glass material, its design and the pressure of the gas make it easy to break cleanly with a swift but firm strike on the finish.
5. Speaking of the gas pressure, put the Champagne in the ice fifteen minutes before the `sabrage` (ensuring you end up drinking some of the content. Plus at the required temperature).
6. Also, Champagne bottles have a punt, as many wine bottles have. You can use your thumb there to hold it more efficiently (you shown the right way, not doing it would be a matter to worry).
