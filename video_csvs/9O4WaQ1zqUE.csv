What you just stated is why Hollywood is dying. If you check articles about the decline of young people going to theaters you would understand much more. Hollywood's mainstay of major box office draw actors declining age, increase in sequels, lack of original ideas, the increase in netflix, streaming online movies, security problems at theaters, and increase in ticket prices is what is harming Hollywood. Not to mention the current sexual accusations that has been going on since the conception of Hollywood and the ""casting couch"".
Have you ever noticed that more and more money is being made overseas than here in the states. Hollywood can no longer rely on American viewers to sustain them monetarily.

"Watogo Was that a joke? Everything you credited to Trump was Obama's efforts. Well, everything but the tax cuts for the 1% that will put the US in another Great Recession within a decade. And of xourse, a Democrat will have to be the one to get us out of it as usual while Republicans pretend it wasn't their fault and their retarded voter base falls for it again.",-0.1811,76

"What an incredibly idiotic and useless attempt to raise awareness. Why didn't they recycle on old dress from their closet and get fashion houses to donate the money it would have cost to have a red carpet dress made to charities supporting assault victims and womens' groups? Hollywood is so lame and vacuous. Ooohh... wearing a black $8000 gown - what a f@#$ing idiotic and useless exercise and ""statement"". I'm not sure what it achieved? Telling us what we already know - that the industry is rife with sexual harrassment and assault? Wow. Thank you stupid Hollywood actors for wearing black. You really helped the movement. *note the sarcasm* Last time I checked, my local womens shelter still can't support all the abused women and children who turn up each day. One of your stupid black ball gowns probably could have paid for a few more beds and support services for these women. Probably could paid to help a couple of victims get support therapy. Yes, very creative Hollywood women. Also very incredibly lame.",-0.9845,201

The group in particular only aim to operate in an agenda that makes them more ‚Äúaccessible/marketable‚Äù to media outlets. In short, they‚Äôre virtue signaling & it‚Äôs pathetic. They, for the most part, aren‚Äôt feminists or allies, they‚Äôre simply living fads trying to jump onto a high speed bandwagon. I would bet my a pair of 22 year old lungs that many of these people can‚Äôt even accurately detail feminist social theory.
