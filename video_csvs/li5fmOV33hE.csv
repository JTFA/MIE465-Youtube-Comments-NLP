A CHOSEN VESSEL The shortest answer is to say the  dog who most closely meets the standards for its' breed is how it is judged. If you want to know those standards you will have to look it up for each individual breed as the standard varies from breed to breed.  The announcers explained all of this during the show if you had of paid attention.,0.0772,70

"In a world of breeds constantly changing, isn't it unsound to judge on what dog of modern age is 'closest to its ancestral breed?'

No need.  This is not about personal opinions it's about which dog conforms the closest to its' breed traits.  You don't need multiple opinions about that because they either conform or they don't.  This show is NOT a popularity contest with the judges.  All that's needed is a judge who is solid in the breed standards of the dogs.  These standards have already been decided by the AKC.,0.3612,75

"That's false. Many terrible dogs have gotten to Westminster. A Pekingese that had to have surgery to fix a defect he was born with that prevented him from breathing properly. German Shepherd Dogs with low set hocks. Bulldogs with no health testing at all. And now a Pug wins the Toy Group, even though he has moderate hip dysplasia. Here's his health results. Moderately dysplastic, one grade above the worst hips you can get. And his results came back June of 2017. Biggie's owner had plenty of time to forfeit his show career and retire him from breeding, as this is a disease with genetic factors. Yet, Biggie is still being studded out and is claimed as a Grand Champion. https://www.ofa.org/advanced-search?f=sr&appnum=1847424",-0.296,136

Our Border Collie sat in thee open gate and kept  the cattle in.  It was a horrific storm,lasted the entire night, and my faithful friend guarded the cattle.  It rained, thundered , lightening, and hailed.  Muffin was soaked but he stood guard.  RIP old and faithful friend.",0.891,91
