They have been donating to the causes for the past 20 years. No one knows that they were doing it. So that is why they are making an ad about it to raise awareness of pediatric cancer.,-0.765,40
This ad is bringing awareness to Pediatric Cancer. Hyundai is using it to say they are giving back to the community. ($130million if you're counting) It was filmed two weeks before the Super Bowl and the Cancer Survivors ARE NOT ACTORS...my niece was one of them and I can assure you that her family and the others involved appreciated the fact that Hyundai is bringing awareness to this cause so that people can donate in anyway they choose.,0.296,86

"This is amazing. Thank you! They have raised a ton of money for Pediatric cancer, they didn't even show a car, priceless. You never think it will happen to you, until it does. At 10 months, our daughter almost lost her life to cancer, her kidneys were failing, she was a day, to a day and a half from dying. I am happy to say, after 8 rounds of chemo, in May, she will celebrate 1 year of being cancer free. Pediatric cancer doesn't get the recognition it deserves, so instead of insulting them, please think of how heartful this is, they are helping save lives, like our daughter Kira. More funding is needed, they are helping more than people know. Don't hate, donate!",0.559,149

Why the fuck do you need to buy a car for cancer research. Actually billions of dollars already goes to  research. How the fuck isn't there a cure already.,-0.9081,32
"Wouldn't you rather buy from a company that actually cares about something, rather than from someone who doesn't? In the end, everyone does business to earn a profit, but I'd rather purchase from a brand who also cares about giving back. And these aren't empty promises by Hyundai. The cancer survivors are real, and people who have gone through that disease understand how important research is. If someone is willing to donate and actually promote an initiative like that, in front of 100 million+ people on Super Bowl, I think it's pretty commendable. I think platforms like these should be used to reinforce messages that help humanity. No one bashes a brand for shameless promoting their product, but if someone speaks up for something positive, everyone jumps in to throw mud. Hyundai has expressed their intent openly, and they're doing their best to be transparent in an increasingly blurry marketplace. Let's support such brands rather than calling them out.",0.9908,178
