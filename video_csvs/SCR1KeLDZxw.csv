"Aaaa your final looks so pretty! Bold eyes and bold lips are a defining statement of strength in my opinion, makes you look like a gorgeous queen. I'm so jealous you got all that stuff from ColorPop! They're some of my favorites.

One thing that I've always kind of wondered is do you have to use bronzer? It's because I actually don't like making my face seem more elongated and mature, and defining my cheek bones. I always want to look rounder and more cute.",0.9798,94
