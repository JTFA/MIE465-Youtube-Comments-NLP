"Baby, I don’t care-
'Bout ""what, when, how, or where.”
Folks are laughing, try'n to make a fuss
They’ll try to make things out for us
But baby I don’t care

Darling, I don’t mind
What they think they’ll find
Of all the secrets they have told
At least I’ve still got you to hold
So darling
I don’t mind

‘Cause I’ll be the one to hold you
When the nights are cold
And although I know I’ve told you
I will tell you forever more

That I don’t give a damn
If they can understand
Of all the things that I have learned
They’re nothing, far as I’m concerned…
So I don’t give a damn

‘Cause I’ll be the one to hold you
When the nights are cold
And although I know I’ve told you
I will tell you forever more that

Babe, it ain’t no thing-
That viper venom’s sting
‘Cause even if it got your goat
Well, I’d kiss you with the antidote
So, babe, it ain’t no thing
And darling, I don’t care

No baby I don’t
Baby, I don’t mind
