New (or ""Prequel"") Trilogy actors, on the other hand.......they were so damn unconvincing. I love the New Trilogy as much as I love the Old one, but I've gotta tell you: sometimes when Hayden Christensen talks I have to concentrate hard not to chuckle. Just that synthetic, boring way of talking he has.......some people even have the nerve to say the Trilogy ruined his career because of negative reviews on his work, but seriously, with that acting that guy wasn't going anywhere, good dialogue or bad dialogue. Lucas should have dubbed him over using someone with a strong and expressive voice, instead of using mr. Google Translator here; people now say: ""Hayden is a good actor, it's Lucas' fault!"". Rubbish. He has always been a terrible actor. Or just not good enogh to act out a bizarre and wooden script. Star Wars dialogues have always been clunky, awkward and sometimes plain terrible (even Mark Hamill and sir Alec Guinness themselves lamented the ""awful dialogue"" in the first movie) but they were professional and were able to speak silly and clich√© lines like: ""I'll never join you!"" with a great dramatic intensity. Bottom line, as much as I don't care thay much about the acting in Star Wars movies it does mean a lot and it's not Lucas' dialogue to be particularly clunky, it's the actor's performances!!!",-0.9941,343
