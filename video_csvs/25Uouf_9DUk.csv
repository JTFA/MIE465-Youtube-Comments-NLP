Daniel Salzer Daniel Salzer have you ever seen a runner fall to the ground while making a catch? Fuck no dumb dumb. The receiver must maintain control to the ground. No where in history is falling and extending your arms considered a football move. Not sure where you learned football but extending your arms is not a football move. In college he would be down at the one yard line. The ball spun in his hands and the left hand came completely off the ball. It's clearly an incomplete pass.,0.3506,98
Daniel Salzer I'm only going to tell you this one last time.  That is not a football move by any definition. There is no coach or anyone that has played at a high level that would agree with you saying what he did should be considered a football move. If the rule wasn't there than yes it would be a touchdown by all other rules but the rule is there for a reason. He has to maintain control throughout the catch all the way to ground. Just like a receiver who catches a pass at back of end zone and puts both feet inbounds and then loses control of ball to ground it's still incomplete. What don't you understand about that. He was not an established runner. He did make catch initially but then lost control when hitting ground. It can't be a fumble and a complete pass at the same time. The catch has to be established first.,-0.3462,170
Daniel Salzer extending your arms is not a football move. Falling to the ground is not a football move. A football move can only be done after a player is determined to be a runner and makes a move up field. Or backwards. The rule has been for some time now a receiver must maintain control to the ground. It's just like the fumble rule for a runner. The ground can't cause a fumble. Just like for a quarter back on a fumble...If the ball cones out of his hand without control even if it goes forward it's a fumble. When Catching the ball you must maintain possession to the ground. Clearly in the replay you see the ball spin and his left hand comes off the ball allowing the ball to touch the ground. Incomplete pass,0.9427,149
Daniel Salzer you don't know what a football move is..a football move has nothing to do with the ball. You have to establish two feet on the ground first and then make a move up field. He did neither of those he fell while catching the ball knee on ground then extends arms and loses control. And before a player can make a football move he has to maintain control to the ground that rule has been around forever...it's not new,-0.2023,88

"I know it's a live play,  that's not the argument , the argument is he broke the plain and I understand the ground can't help you catch the ball , he's knee being down was a way to get my point across of him not being in the air , the argument is the NFL has become so inconsistent with what a catch is 10 years ago that's a catch , the whole argument of what's a catch and what's not started in the 2000 NFL title game when the bucs were robbed of the win then the following year they changed the rule . My main point is if that's not a catch then when a running back dives for the end zone and breaks the plain while extending the ball gets it knocked out of his hands then that should be a fumble but as it stands it's considered a TD when ball carriers due that because they have ""possession"" well if replay doesn't allow you to see that he had complete possession before he reaches to breaks the plain then why have replay , I understand the rule very clearly the problem is it's stupid and taking away from the game",0.048,207

"The thing is his knee touched the ground first. If he was standing up and never dropped the ball, it wouldn't be a big deal. When his knee hits the ground, whatever state the ball is in is applicable for the whole play. So since he didn't have full control of the ball when his knee touched it isn't a catch",0.34,66
"Thee Don

""Item 2. Possession of a Loose Ball. To gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player must have complete control of the ball and have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground inbounds, and then maintain control of the ball long enough to clearly become a runner.""

"Well one he was not in the air , hard to be in the air when your knee is down , secondly if a runner extends the ball and it breaks the plain and a defender knocks it out of his hands is it a fumble or a TD? So why are the rules different for a ball carrier ? I understand if the catch is made in the end zone you have to come down with control of the ball the only difference is his knee is down and is making a football move a ""football move"" and we've been told once a player I making a football that broke the plain of the endzone after his knee was down and turn to make a move the inconsistencies in what a catch is in the NFL is laughable",0.0926,142

"thomasj1026 Alright man, I'm only going to explain this to you one more time. He pulled the ball into his body. THEN he looked and saw that he was near the endzone. THEN he decided to go for the touchdown and reach out after already pulling his hands in. I don't care if the NFL doesn't consider it a football move. It was a deliberate attempt to make the ball move further up the field AFTER securing it with two hands and moving it into his body. It is possible to make a catch and then fumble a ball. If it had been a diving catch where he had never pulled in the ball and his arms were always outstretched then I would agree with you, but he secured the ball then reached to move the ball forward which should show that he had enough possession of the football to make that choice.",0.7533,164
