The shimmer is an in-depth exploration of what cancer is. It's a product/creation of the very entity it inhabits.

Ps. & Spoiler Alert:
At the end, that's not an ""alien"" it's a product of her own being. Notice how the being was formed from a spec of blood on her face and how it mimicked everything she did. It wasn't until she recognized this, that she stopped fighting it... It was pure intelligence and knew what to do, going back to its source of origin when being burned (transformed).",-0.1027,207

"What a lame movie... Sending a full male squad, followed by a full female squad? And not wearing any protective suits when going into an unknown space? Even after the first squad of men didn't survive? And the government agency doesn't blockade the whole location for suspected alien lifeforms or for potential danger? Doesn't make any logical sense...",-0.8426,65

"Where did I compare it to a War Biopic??? You keep saying that. I find that having women carry M-16s ridiculous in this case. They didn't know how to protect themselves. I find it a stretch to say 'well we've tried sending men so let's try sending women this time'. Bollocks. First, you have no idea what is going on one foot inside the Shimmer. Second, you have no idea if something is killing those that enter whether it be animal, alien, biological, radiation, etc. or if they're even dead. I merely stated that it was hard to follow given that these women were completely inept at protecting themselves. Go ahead and salute the feminism in this movie but in the end she used a white phosphorous grenade to kill it left by a male soldier (yes, her husband). 
   I don't know what that means to have a shit or a haircut but something stinks and it's your logic. I'll let you have the last word or several pages of comments so you can continue to repeat yourself. :)",-0.9642,207

"You're a pristine example of why Paramount felt justified in not giving the movie a theatrical release worldwide. No deeper meaning to the term 'not knowing whether you're having a shit or a haircut', just a way of expressing someone having a hard time knowing what day it is or being unable to tie their shoelaces, ect. I'm definitely not saluting feminism, but I'm not a dribbler who gets outraged for the sake of it- especially when the movie stayed true to the book in this particular aspect. Off you trot lad.",-0.453,102
"You're just highlighting more about yourself than the movie with this comment darling. a) The leading characters were all female in the book, and it's explained why this was the case. b) They had to be broken to agree to take the mission on, this was explained and elaborated on in the scene where they were in the boats paddling down the river after the Onyx Alligator attack. Sounds like you need to watch the movie again, or don't if it wasn't your cup of tea.",0.3818,95

the movie is completely PC crap... sleeping with black guy (totally irrelevant to the story)... only woman team (complete idiocy)... the problem is the world is forcing women to adapt a male energy and male view of things. this is not healthy for anyone. the longer you get into the story the less sense it makes. suddenly she goes alone when they talk about instinct all the time. the only instinct in fierce danger is to stay together. you can really smell how forced it is... for example when she is in bed with her husband and she needs to have the upper hand,-0.8085,117

Now after have seen it, and cant say this was the best movie of all time. But it is the most intriging I've seen in a very long time. Allso the soundtrack is so bizarre...but perfectly in sync with the scenes so make sure your seeing it with dolby surround or a headset / cinema whatever you prefer.
