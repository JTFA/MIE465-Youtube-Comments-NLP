"""There is a line that would not cross when pushing someone, I'm not here to traumatize people"". I feel like that is something that generally, only a woman director would say. They have that kind of sensitivity that is not always present in male directors, who are more often interested in getting it done or getting it the way they want. I'm no expert but I have in the past been privy to behind the scene processes of film making and male directors are more oriented to what they feel they need to get out of something or someone than the need of the person doing it for them. 
Of course this is not a statement describing all male directors. Obviously not trying to pain a broad stroke. But when a woman director says the things Jenkins says, it seems more understandable because they have that innate sensitivity, while it may not always be so overt or obvious for their male counterpart.",0.7737,176

I have no problem criticizing a woman like Angelina who has no respect for women. She has a long history of pursuing married, committed men. Jennifer Aniston was not the first woman Angelina wronged. She also set her eyes on Billy Bob Thornton who was engaged to Laura Dern. Laura took a long time to get over the betrayal. This is what Laura said about it:
“I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I’ve never heard from him again.” 
Just to be clear, both Brad and Billy Bob were just as much to blame as Angelina. My problem with Angelina is that she has a long history of chasing after men who are engaged or married; she did it many times way before Billy Bob. It’s a pattern.
She must take pleasure in the power of being able to get a man to abandon their woman for her.
She’s also a liar and a hypocrite. Anyone remember her saying years ago that she hired a hitman to kill her? 😂 
Anyway, I would never say anything bad about Patty or Greta.

i feel a lot of people hype up logan and it was actually the one that was just good not great. people have spent many many years with this logan and we were told it would be hugh's last film as wolverine plus it adapted a story we have been saying should be adapted for a very long time. it was also much better than the previous basic wolverine movies. so logan felt much better than it really was. i think wonder woman will stand the test of time (if they update the cgi) where logan will not. even if people binge all of the x men movies and wolverine movies they wont have all of those years adding to the experience of it or being told it is hugh's last movie as logan (even though disney most likely has x men now if the gov agrees and he will most likely come back),0.7356,163

"momomama That’s true. Losing weight does indeed define and sculpt the face. But not to this degree.
Look, I think Angelina was already gorgeous when she was younger before the plastic surgery. But you only have to watch her younger self in videos to see she went under the surgeons knife.",0.6369,59

propaganda? umm men weren't nazis in wonder woman. wonder woman's crew was full of guys and steve taught her so much in the movie. one of the villains was also a woman. you either didn't see the movie or lack comprehension skills.,-0.8271,47
