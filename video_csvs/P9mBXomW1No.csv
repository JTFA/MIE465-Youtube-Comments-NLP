This was awesome. You look super cute. My daughter's and son in laws are @ Disneyworld this week for my youngest daughters college grad gift. The whole group even son in laws and sister in law are all dressing up this whole week to different Disney movies. They had so much fun planning it for 2 months before they went. All of them knew but her. We didn't even know they were going to FL. She cried. It was a great surprise. Peeps have 2 be careful what they wear at the park. They can wear inspired clothes but anyone in costume gets kicked from the park. Understandable as they want kids safe and don't want guests and employees being confused. They are having a blast. Disney is a great place to do this and the pictures end up looking amazing. The characters even got involved one time. Minney Mouse went and grabbed Mickey and took my daughter by the hand and showed him her wedding band and then pointed at her empty finger and shook her finger at Mickey. Then they took all kinds of pictures with them. They had a blast and the employees really enjoy it too. üòÅ,0.9919,219
