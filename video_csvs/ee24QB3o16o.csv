"Common Sense That is precisely what I want! to ignore it!! or cast other races doing it. but not black people! for instance... 

if the only roles women can get is as a prostitute, should they take those roles because prostitution is mostly an occupation for women? I think not! take the roles that uplift your kind, not the ones that make them look bad because ""it really happened"" or because ""its true"". 

propaganda has nothing to do with truth, yet many regimes use it to brainwash people. what you constantly see and read, you will believe. so cast black people as strong, just, and peaceful regardless if its true, not as gangstas and thugs. Idc how real or true something is.

you should read ""the souls of black folk"" written by an american  former slave! back in the day, white people use to write books about how stupid and illiterate black people were. that they were just soulless and violent. That book changed the view of an entire nation. by showing the positive, not the negative. 

Do you really want people in China and Japan to think this is how black people are. just violent running around with guns. because after all.. according to you ""its true"". The west already think we are shit, so your great idea is to cast black people as shit. because that will make everything authentic.",0.8091,274

"Did you know that if we make Jesus Christ our personal Lord and Savior, everytime we sin we have every right to as Jesus Christ to forgive us of our sin(s)?  We can be cleansed as though we have never sinned and graciously spared damnation. Jesus Christ did what no other human being has ever done or could ever do. He is the ONLY on this planet who has never sinned. Because He has never sinned, He is the one and only acceptable sacrifice God the Father would accept to pay ransom payment for each of our sins. That is simply AMAZING isn't it? JESUS DID IT!! Seek Jesus Christ today and receive His FREE GIFT of eternal forgiveness and salvation. May God bless you in the glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. ❤️❤️❤️ (1 Peter 2:22; 5 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 4:15; 1 John 3:5)",0.9512,173

"danny lee how many black British films have you seen showing black gangsters? The last film I watched was black panther about a black super hero and prior to that on ITV I watched trauma about a black doctor based in Britain. I only care if this movie is good or not, I enjoyed the book and I think black British movies need community support not comments like yours.",0.8654,73
danny lee you are only concerned about looking bad? You are not interested in whether or not it's a good movie? You have no interest in the opportunities and experience black actors received by playing this role? Sounds like you just want to put your head in the sand and pretend this type of violence is not happening in the black communities. Knife crime in London is out of control are you suggesting we don't talk about it in case black people look bad as it's a stereotype? People like you who want to ignore reality are part of the problem.,-0.954,107
"danny lee you are way too concerned about what other people think! If you are black and live in a predominantly white country you will go mad worrying about what white people think. Know yourself and the great accomplishments the black community have made. Be proud to be black. Do you think every time I watch a martial arts movie I think all Chinese people can kick my ass? Do you think when a white person acts in a film role as a serial killer or a child molester white people worry that black people will think badly of them? Of course not. They don't care what you think. They remain proud because they know its a film and doesn't represent them all. There are many positive black role models. Only a racist would come to the ridiculous conclusion that all blacks are gangsters and you would be wasting your time trying to change the mind of a racist. If all the images on tv of black people were positive a racist will still hate you. Don't waste your time worrying about those people and certainly don't let them determine whether or not you can enjoy a movie. Remember it's a movie. Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, Walter Rodney, Alice Walker. The list goes on of great literature produced by black people I have read. Victor Headley's book was entertaining but a completely different genre. As long as you are appreciating all forms of black literature there is room for Yardie and if you appreciate all literature you can never come to the conclusions you have made.",-0.3286,290

I don't care what black Americans do with their image personally... The rest of the world already think they are lawless trash on welfare. I have a problem with Caribbean stereotypes being perceived as violent, when for so long we have been perceived as a place and people to slow down, relax, and enjoy life.

Every movie portraying black people as thugs and ganstas only strengthens the belief black people are lawless trash.",-0.6861,114
