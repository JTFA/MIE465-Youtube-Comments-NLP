I think I recognized you from Ijustines Dailybooth maybe??
      As I heard you tell this I though exactly what you said, you are Trevor. As humans we feel the need to categorize everything.  That's truly not how it is. Our external body isn't always going to match how we feel inside. Not everyone is going be as girlie as a Kardashian or masculine like some burly mountain man. You are perfect how you are, whatever you want to wear today. LORD I've had many people ask me if I'm gay because I wear ""jeans & vans too much"". So silly. 
       After a few neuropsych classes I can tell you that most of this occurs during fetal development, it's our DNA as well as how much of which hormones we are exposed to as a fetus. (Genetically....not what a mother ingests). It's really truly biological. It may be hard for someone who identifies strongly as one gender to understand, but not everyone FEELS like one gender.

"You are as a person beautiful. It doesn't matter if you're male or female or transgender or whatever because that's not what defines you. You're Trevor. In every aspect of your being you're gorgeous. I'm so glad to have had and to still have the privilege of watching you grow. You make me question myself and my beliefs about myself which I am crazy grateful for. You along with Shane and countless other brave You Tubers have helped me in my decision of sexuality. You've given me the advantage to look at myself and think ""Hey, maybe I will always be bisexual, maybe I'll be lesbian in the future or straight but none of that matters right now. What matters right now is the now. It doesn't matter what we love or who we love, just that we love."" Right now I just want to give you the biggest hug and thank you and let you know that I fully, completely and always will accept Trevor. 
I love you and Thank You for moulding me into a better person 
Always, Ella xx",0.9933,200
