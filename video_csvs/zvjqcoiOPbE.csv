"Just watched them live in Nashville this past weekend, and while I would normally fully agree with you, Ben didn't sound very well. His voice just isn't there, and he didn't look comfortable up there at all. I've watched BB live since 2004, and his voice never quivered and broke before like it did during this last performance. I think his sickness is really starting to affect his singing ability more and more.

Takes NOTHING away from this song or even BB's performance on stage, as they were great! He did a great job, kept the crowd in it (in fact, he had us singing quite a bit of the songs because it was obvious he was having trouble), and it was very much enjoyable. In a way, it was kind of inspiring to see him just pushing through anyway.

This is all to say that I believe that this is why they would have autotuned as much of it as they did.",0.9605,182
