"The Cup Song/When I'm Gone = The Beginning
Freedom = The end

Beca first sang the ""Cup Song/When I'm Gone"" in the first movie when she enters the world of A Capella singing where she finds her true friends and start their journey as the Barden Bellas.

""Freedom"" is the last song that Beca sang with her friends as they end their journey to A Cappella singing and move on with their lives. Even if they're apart from each other, their heart, soul and their vocal cords sings as one and connected as one.

Beca thought us the true value of friendship that what ever differences you and your friends have at the end you still support each other, care each other and love each other. What ever life offers us, as long as you have your family and TRUE FRIENDS we can face the world without fear.

Is that I don't belong to you
(You're gonna miss me when I'm gone)
And you don't belong to me

Freedom, I won't let you down
Freedom, I won't give you up
Freedom (you're gonna miss me when I'm gone)
You're gonna miss me by my hair (freedom)
Gotta have some faith in the sound (freedom)
It's the one good thing that I've got
(Freedom, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone)
