Superman got resurrected and said he felt *itchy* and *smelled good* because hey that's what Superman has said in past 75 years of history... That he smells good and feels itchy after coming back to life. 

Joss whedon guy wanted to make Tony Stark out of batman... He didn't succeed in the beginning scene of batman with parademon which he wanted to make funny.... 😕 instead he did it with Superman... Saying to almost a God like being the Steppenwolf himself... Like.. *is this guy still bothering you?* I'm pretty sure it's Tony Stark dialogue...

Joss whedon doesn't understand the characters... *He has the same shitty dialogue over and over again... And it is gonna happen in every single movie he ever does*

Wonder Woman said... *I am dealing with children*

Cyborg cracked a 4 years old kid mindset joke, *being a cyborg my leg hurts* and all Whedon Bullshit dialogue and Superman laughed saying *I was better dead*

And all these idiots talking about the mustache situation with Henry Cavil, I did not know beforehand, so I never noticed the CGI shaved mustache. Therefore, it is irrelevant whether he had one or not because I did not notice. The only complain I have was the amount of CGI in the town where they fought somewhere in a Eastern Europe.

Not only that but you can feel for all those characters. If war machine were to die you’d care about that. It’s great, why didn’t DC do this before they released justice league.

"IMO for the combat scenes, what can one really do with these heroes? I mean everyone on the team has literally the speed and power of Thor (except for Batman of course). For the MCU you can slow down the action for the likes of Captain America, Black Widow, Spiderman, even Iron Man, and then have Thor and Hulk fly by in passing. But for DCU everyone moves at the pace of the passerby characters in the Avengers. Granted it could be improved but for the downfalls of the source material, I thought it was pretty good.

As for the team building... would help if we got all the other movies first. Cyborg could do without, his shortened timeline makes sense. But Aquaman clearly has something missing. I don't mean his interactions with other characters, I just feel like Momoa didn't know what to do with the role. This was probably because Aquaman is so drastically different from previous iterations, much like WW. Considering Aquaman was a counter to most of the team, it fell apart when we had barely any context for the character.

This movie happened too soon, is all I'm saying. We needed an Aquaman movie, maybe even a Batman or a Flash movie in order for Snyder to get a hang of portraying the heroes. This was a definite improvement over previous films and Snyder is clearly getting the hang of it (with a little help from Whedon of course) but again, for something of this scale it needed to happen later on.",0.9918,289

"Just dropping by some opinions.

The biggest problem I had with this move was how so out of place  elements that are supposed to pull you into the movie felt like. It's like someone just went through a check list and that was it.

For example, we need to have conflict right? Queoe in generic villan (not a big problem). Problem is, why is he there? The explanation seems to be that the boxes called him because of the fear that the world was feeling cus of sups death. Why not come during ww1? Or 2? Or cold War, as far as I know it takes place in a some what similar world and was never explained.

Other thing is lack of consistency. Why is the first scene batman vs demonguy when wolf is not even around? And how does he knows its attracted by fear? Why did the robber made the leap assumption that it was because of sups death? (heavy handed exposition much?).

Why was wolf able to get to the Amazon's and under water box (forgot how you spell their civilization sorry) with out any apparent barrier, but had to kidnap people to get the last box location. And why is it that the league was able to use the box to revive sup and then afterwards wolf came out of nowhere to get it, couldn't he have done that before?

The final fight was just terrible. First I had sense of danger at all. It was a cgi landscape with some people (the farmers) that were thrown in to give a sense of urgency but it did nothing of that sort.

And why oh why did they even go there. They had literally 0%chance to win. At the end they needed sup's strength to separate the boxes, did anyone on the team had that strength? As far as this movie goes not that I know, although I understand that ww and aquaman should be enough for that on the comics. And why even bother to make us sit through 2h of movie just so that one guy could literally do all the work, all of it. He saved the people killed the bad guy and flew of into space and winked to the camara, the others were just kinda there, only cyborg was useful and that was it. Also why did sup complain about pain from the box explosion (a guy who can take building shattering punches without flinching and more) and cyborg was alive when he is so delicate his limbs can be pulled off?

And why in the flying ducks did those demons leave all of those people alive when they were all hidding in fear for God knows how long but the moment wolf shows a bit of fear everyone literally everyone goes for him, and why the fuck was he carried away by the lights.

Seriusly guys, some just some jokes and some cool looking scenes don't make a good movie good. I would say this is an entertaining movie, eye catching and was able to deliver a somewhat feel of cooperation between favorite heros of childhood. But no where near was it a good movie.

"Overall Justice League wasn't horrible, but it wasn't excellent either. If I would compare this movie to the first Avengers film, then there is no contest to see which one had better delivery. If anything, this felt like Age of Ultron; wasn't bad, just decent with some flaws here and there. What was absolute shit in this movie was the CGI. Holy crap, the background CGI was so noticeable, not to mention Cyborg and Stepennwolf. Honestly, it was a little distracting. Some of the lines were weird too, and out of place. I definitely noticed some bad acting and delivery on some characters. To be frankly honest, the best actor who delivered the best acting in this movie was Jeremy Irons. Ben Affleck did really well too. CGI Cyborg felt cringey at times and I'm sure that Jason Momoa's Aquaman has a dual-split personality. The Flash was awesome, but c'mon... how does The Flash CW's speed run look just as good, if not a little better than the film? Jeremy Jahns also pointed out that the film ran really short; just under two hours. I guess I can't blame Jos Whedon or Zack Snyder on that part; it was an executive order from the top. You can only tell so much story and background in such a short time. To be honest, this movie deserved at least two and a half hours, if not three. Only because unlike the other Marvel movies, we had no character solo movie to start out with besides Supes and Bats. Overall, it was meh. Not bad, but meh.",0.9956,303

The movie was okay. I kind of found it boring it was a bit too serious for me and I feel like they should have lightened up the field. Me and my five kids were watching it and it was good but very serious. My kids were expecting Teen Titans,0.2263,53

Flaws: 1. They didn't use the characters well. 2. The CGI is terrible. 3. Steppenwolf was the worst villain ever.",-0.8807,50
"The problem with the movie is that it's just too straightforward. You got a bad guy coming to conquer Earth and then you got Wonderwoman and Batman gathering a team to stop him... and that' exactly what they do in the end. The movie itself is very well executed but the idea is just too simple and that's a shame. Also it seemed to me that there was way too many cgi, especially when it came to scenes with Steppenwolf.

I really wish there was more team morale build-up moments where you get to see through the characters, but its whatever.

"To be honest. The First time I watched the trailer I was like ""Meh"". Then while I was playing Skyrim, my dad asked me if I wanted to watch the movie with him. I was like I don't know when he asked me because until that point I wasn't sure if I wanted to see Justice League. Up until we arrived to the theater and watching the trailers, I saw the Black Panther and Infinity War, that's when I started to think that it may be like Avengers in some regard. Then I watched and.... I like it.

It's actually a pretty good movie. The characters were pretty good, the backstory of the main villain was amazing (I could just watch an entire prequel movie around that final battle.) Some things were actually pretty interesting, the actors were awesome, the music was great and the final battle was amazing. Aquaman was for me one of the most original comic book representations I saw so far. To bring a guy who talks to fish, with this really boring suit to then make them this pretty intimidating and awesome, who when Bruce tells him about the whole ""do you talk with fish?"" thing and he reacting like ""Really?"" made me feel so amazed of how they potrayed him, he give me this Thor-like impression and I really liked it. Flash was probably my favorite character from the team, he's just a guy with superspeed powers who is so amazed of being part of a team with a billionaire martial arts master, ninja vigilante and a hot amazon warrior, that's also like very likeable and I loved every scene he was in. Cyborg started like a ""monster"" wanting to be human, rejecting the powers and abilities he ""adquired"" during the accident, making him cold and distant to everyone, even his own father. Then after meeting Diana and knowing that both were very similar to each other,  since both lost something very important to them (Diana the man he loved and Cyborg he's humanity) he started becoming more open to people, so much that he risked his life in order to save his dad and other innocent people regardless of his appearence. Wonder Woman and Batman were good. Bruce is still in pain and regretful for what happened to Superman and it's trying to fix all the wrongs he made before that. The relationship of Bruce and Diana is great. I like how both are coworkers and at he same time deeply care for each other. (Spoilers) I really liked the way Superman returned. After reviving he didn't know what was happeining and restarted his powers from zero as he saw the others in x-ray vision without knowing it and and when he fought  the team, we started to comprehend how powerful he is in comparision to the others. Then starting to remember who he was after seeing Louis. Then he remember his reason to fight and decided to protect the planet once again. The final battle was just amazing, with the heores really trusting each other after speending time with each one of them and working together in order to save Earth. Then we saw Superman's might and power witnissing how he just toys with the villain and beating him up when not even the whole team strugled with him.  

My only complains were that they made this movie like really quickly. One of the reasons the Avengers was so loved is because they set up the MCU with Iron Man, Thor and Captain America up until that point, we started to know characters like Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Nick Fury and many others, knowing their stories, their personalities and the world itself so when the first trailer showed up we where ready for it. If the DCEU first gave us movies about Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman like with Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, we could have loved the movie. My other complain was that the villain was like really plain, I mean, I really don't care if villains are evil just for the sake of being evil, that's because there villains because there like to be evil. Look at the Joker, we don't know noting about his past (Don't you f**king dare tell me about the Killing Joke bacjkstory and that he was a thief with a pregnant wife and bla bla bla bla bla) and still we love him because of his personality and other things. But the villain was evil because he thougth that he had the right to conquer Earthand some boring shit that they didn't made him a personality of whatever. If they just made the Darkseid we fear and love then I wouldn't care.  For me this is a very good movie. Maybe not he best movie of 2017 but at least the #11.",0.9921,896

"Warner Brothers is totally botching their DC universe, completely wasting events that were huge deals in the comics.  Batman Superman: Dawn of Justice should have been a fight between BM and SM with more development of the justice league members, no Doomsday or death of Superman just the introduction of a menacing villain for the next movie.  Justice League should have been them fighting someone the audience actually anticipated and Darkseid showing up after defeating said menacing villain, kicking everyone's ass and then apologizing for (Steppenwolf) but warning that his own coming will be far worse.  Then comes Justice League: Doomsday where they all fight him and Supes dies.  Then the return of various superman imposters just like the comics because that story deserves to be told.  Then finally Justice League: Apocalypse, Darkseid comes to burn the Earth from the inside out.",-0.8897,157

"just saw this movie an hour ago. i gotta say, im not very happy how i felt about it. it was like watching a long trailer of the movie instead the movie itself. too rushed to introduce the characters. not all funny moments were funny. 
i liked the batman man to man(or demon) action scenes especially later in the movie were the bat swings towards the demons, kicks one en throws a exploding bataring towards the other one. liked the feel of the first half, the second half was messy in my opinion. the introduction of steppenwolf was good, fights against the amazons was great. my problem with steppenwolf is that he came in like a badass full of confidence he could take on the entire league and at the end he was reduced to a scared mortal. didnt like the fight between him and superman. very weak villian.  i liked one line of steppenwolf though, it was something like i still have my axe wet of the blood of your sisters after diana's comment about not to overestimate yourself. you just dont give a villian an exit like they did in the movie, attacked by his own parademons because they smell the fear on him ?? we all know that the good guys are going to win in the end but dont make it so easy on them. 
aquaman sitting accidentally on the lasso of truth and saying some honest stuff was funny. diana was good. closeup from the back in red lether pants was very sexy(i assume it was leather because it was shiney). i liked cyborg and there is some great potential in a separate story. also loved the mentioning of darkseid. im just worried they will make him to weak in power. i would have liked to see the league get hurt badly (including superman), screem in pain, the desparation in their eyes, confusion and doubting whether they can take on steppenwolf. and then eventually win. not that i hate them but a close call fight is more enjoyeable than a boring one where there is no doubt over who is going to win. i apologize for my english if i made some mistakes in my spellings. it is not my native language. i hope at least ripple dont disappoint me. have a nice day !!",0.9822,434

the movie would have been great if WB just let the director create the movie they removed 30 min from the original with all of those scenes the movie would have been great the story of cyborg would be told better. many funny scenes would have made the movie much better and plus the final fight would have been longer the only problem i had is the villain other than that i couldn't care less about two 1 second clip of superman's cgi removed moustache looking bad and with those scenes the movie wouldn't' have felt rushed,0.7409,99
