"500 miles range?   NOT ENOUGH dude.  Team drivers DO NOT STOP and consider the ones leaving from Qu√©bec Canada (atlantic side) going accross the states to California, that's about 1800 miles  NONE STOP.  So how can they meet their schedule in 3 days and a half??  A single driver can make it in 5 days (back and forth) but has to stop after 14 hours of driving. So your electric truck has to last 13 hours NON STOP mister. So it's not about mile range here, it's about hours driven that the electric truck can last.

500 miles range? Very poor effort. I don't think that any company or sole operator would buy it without at least 1000 miles range. Especially not in Australia taking in consideration that long haul truckers go 600-700 miles one way. very disappointing range,-0.7837,47

If a tire were to ever blow out, how the heck would you safely remove it and would it even survive such a scenario without being torn to pieces when the tire falls apart? 

Secondly, the performance on this truck is incredible for its size, but wouldn't that require truck drivers to add extra security to their loads so that the contents in the trailer don't shift all over the place while out on the road? More performance in the front generally equals more gravity shifting toward the back.",0.7782,136
