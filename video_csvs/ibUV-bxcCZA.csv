"I played with that a bit, and it looks like you enter the ciphertext on the first gear, then read the plaintext off the second gear.

If this is correct, I have two questions:
1) What is the purpose of the third gear, and
2) Actually, what is the purpose of multiple gears, since any character will always map to the same character at the output, regardless of the position in the text, making this a simple substitution cipher?

I don't mean to criticize that you didn't emulate the full Enigma mechanism, but it just seems like an overly complicated way of implementing a substitution cipher, if I understand it correctly. Is the point just obfuscation?

Very nice craftsmanship overall.  It certainly would have kept me going for quite a while.",0.9312,150
