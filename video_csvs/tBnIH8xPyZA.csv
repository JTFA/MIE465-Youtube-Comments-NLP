"I love your apartment! I enjoyed seeing how you decorated. It looks very homey. I love that you show your love of your Grandma. I grew up with my Mother and Grandmother in the same home. I have nothing but sweet memories growing up. I'm not great with plants either but I try. I think if you clip off the brown areas of your plants more of the energy will go to the part of the plant that is still alive and make sure you don't over water. Make sure they can drain so the plant doesn't sit in water all of the time. If I had a bed with no door I would put up a curtain or long beads. The tiny dolls are worry dolls and many people keep them. You give your worries to them. Children often give the doll their worries and they put them under their pillow. It takes their nightmares away. One place they are made is in Guatemala but I'm sure there are more places. I love them for the mere fact they are tiny lol.

"I suppose it really is all about what you're willing to pay for. Some people would think I'm stupid for buying a 300,000 dollar house with only 1400sqft but in the most expensive county in Colorado that's a downright steal. But I'm willing to pay more for the location, safe environment, views and close proximity to outdoor spaces. Sure I could save a lot of money by buying a house in Arkansas but then I'd have to live in Arkansas. People that live in New York give up wide open spaces, cars, square footage, in home laundry and loads of other things but in their opinion they are gaining so much more. They obviously love the busy city life and access to literally anything at any hour and they're willing to pay for it. I have to remind myself that while these prices seem insane for what you're getting, someone else might say the same thing about my lifestyle.",0.8897,172

"I'm  really happy for you that you like living in New York so much, but I just don't get it.  I don't see what's so great about being able to walk to the coffee shops and grocery store, etc.  I live in Kansas City and even tho' the shopping center is only about 4 blocks away, I wouldn't think of walking there.  I get into my car in my inside garage, use the automatic door opener to get out, and drive there, as well as anywhere else I want to go.  When I bought this 3 bedroom house with an over sized 2 car garage, a full bath and 2 half baths and a finished living area in my walkout basement making a 4th bedroom, the payment was only $350 per month (it's now paid off).  So I don't understand why anyone would want to live in an over crowded expensive city.  We have everything in Kansas City that New York has; art galleries, museums, ballet, symphony orchestra, Starlight Theater, Major League Sports, great nightclubs and restaurants,  beautiful parkways and parks, and more fountains than any city in the world with the possible exception of Rome Italy.

"Maidenhair ferns are finnicky....best used in terrariums so they have constant moisture and are out of drafts.

"The little dolls in the box are called ‚Äúworry dolls‚Äù. I have a set given me by a friend, I want to say brought back from Guatemala, but I think they‚Äôre pretty much a folk item everywhere from Mexico down to South America. Before bed each night, you name a worry you have while holding the doll, essentially ‚Äúgiving‚Äù the doll your worry. Place in box. It‚Äôs said the worries will go away while you get a restful sleep as you‚Äôve got no worries on your mind to keep you awake. They‚Äôve helped me when very worried, unable to sleep - more of a psychological thing taking your mind off what‚Äôs worrying you. I love that you have so much from your family! My mother was 100% Italian, both sides of her family all artists of some kind. I‚Äôm the family heirloom collector. I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôll make room for giant hand carved pieces of furniture my great grandfather made, paintings, my Mama‚Äôs (grandma) dishes, and so on. My siblings have no sentimentality for any of it, but then again I‚Äôve collected and sold vintage off an on for over 40 years so of course I love anything with family history! I too wear something of my mothers every single day since I was 13. It‚Äôs a stainless steel cuff made for her by a cousin who was a steelworker, building the original Tappan Zee bridge across the Hudson. Not only precious to me, but some NY history. Even more precious since my mum passed in June last. I think it‚Äôs so wonderful you keep that connection to family. Wish mine was the same, my mum was the glue. Won‚Äôt even go into what my ‚Äúfamily‚Äù has turned into, it‚Äôs sick. Thank goodness for my own little family I can share the love and keep the memories alive!
