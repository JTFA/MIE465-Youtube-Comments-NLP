"After watching several interviews of both Kim and SJP I‚Äôve concluded that SJP is not the nice person she portrays in public Sarah has always played the poor victim, someone who may react passive aggressively to try to look like the innocent one Kim is the strong respectful person who is comfortable with her age and is very intelligent and assertive. Kim has even published a book for young girls in learning self confidence. Kim is childless by choice which I believe is a very selfless act as she has said it‚Äôs no way to have children when you‚Äôre working long hours. I have a coworker who is like SJP who is very selfish but on outward appearance she appears concerned for others and always playing the victim. SJP is very good at branding her good girl image by choosing a pre-vetted interview with a friend. And like the rest of the commenters have said, SJP should not be shocked unless they‚Äôve kept in contact outside of work. Good acting SJP.",0.982,188

I did like SJP but she‚Äôs too airy with no real substance in her interviews.  Lots of words without really saying anything... as if she‚Äôs just portraying an image or persona.  

Kim Cattrail?  Now she does have substance.  She‚Äôs far more interesting, classy and genuine with a wonderful intellect.  She may be different from Samantha but she‚Äôs just as phenomenal. 

Kim does look younger than SJP and more natural and attractive.",0.9807,105
"Kim is being honest! I think even Chris Noth mentioned how bullying SJP was on the set. She is the only one who made tons of money with SATC, playing a good girl with no nudity clause in her contract and still acts and dresses like she's 30 now. SPJ influenced Samantha's character to be silly, with menopause, cancer, weight gain, like every single, professionally sucsessful and gorgeous women should have it.

They don‚Äôt owe each other anything. But it‚Äôs a bit hypocritical for you to then say Sarah owes Kim kindness or some bullshit. Like who cares. The reason she won‚Äôt do the movie isn‚Äôt because she doesn‚Äôt like Sarah, it‚Äôs because the studio wouldn‚Äôt give in to all her ridiculous demands. Demands that I found ridiculous and arrogant for her to even ask for. 

As for the whole brother thing, Sarah was asked at random by a reporter... what was she supposed to say? Fuck her brother who cares? No, she was professional and gave condolences. Condolences I‚Äôm sure she meant. Even when you don‚Äôt get along with someone or are in the middle of a fight with them, you still feel for them when something terrible happens.

And lastly with the whole Sarah hasn‚Äôt got an Oscar thing... LOL has Kim?? I haven‚Äôt even seen her in anything other than SITC and whilst her character was fun, she was hardly a phenomenal actress. Very two dimensional, with no major character development. And this isn‚Äôt even about who is Oscar worthy üôÑ this is about Kim being LUCKY enough to be offered millions to do a fun role and her being arrogant enough to list insane demands and then have a hissy fit when they don‚Äôt accept. Sarah meanwhile was ready to do the role and she doesn‚Äôt even need it as much as Kim does. Sarah had a TV show and a company and is still very in demand. 

Kim acted like a brat. Therefore I am on Sarah‚Äôs side. You don‚Äôt have to agree, I don‚Äôt really give a shit. Take your hysterics elsewhere.",0.7006,376

This was a bussiness,  if you and your agent couldn't ink the deal for more money or a better position then tou should have left the show back then Kim. But no she was propelled to the top just like the rest of the ladies were. They don't have to be pit against each other in order for all to have success. No we don't know what happenes, but I promise you as a 40 something,  there are people out there who ypu are perfectly nice to, who you speak to and ask about their families and they will still lash out at you because of their own insecurities.",0.9206,163
Sjp always looks like she‚Äôs been caught in headlights.,0.3612,12
Sjp from what I‚Äôve heard is irl not a nice person. She plays victim with the fluttering eyes but she‚Äôs being dishonest. They treated Kim like crap. Sarah was outshone by kim and the rest of the cast took sarahs side to keep their jobs. Ive heard this for years and from many people.,-0.7855,63
"Sjp has ALWAYS been a mean girl and fake. 

People on set knew how she made the story writers make digs at samanthas character. And focusing on her age. AND making her the one to hve cancer so kim worried  about her future on the show. She had a lot of people wrapped around her thumb. Kim is the classy one here she didn't  resort to those tactics.",-0.7951,74
"Sjp has been bringing up kim in interviews for years, shaming her for not wanting to do another satc movie, and now she's surprised kim doesn't want to talk to her? And she KEEPS talking about her still? That woman has no class",-0.222,47
Sjp is getting older..divorce sucks...kc looks amazing...√†nd being true to herself..maybe sjp needs the money...shoe line is gone...she isn't relevant anymore..plus renting a house and leaving someone out because they have a husband. .sjp was married yet she didn't jave a house to herself..come on people..,0.4215,64
"Sjp, dont let that chic get you down. Maybe kims going crazy in her old age. Maybe shes drinking alot lately. Woman are so hard to get along with!",-0.6567,34
"So basically what Sarah just said was....  'its not how she recalls it' AND she wouldve liked it if kim allowed the magnitude of the show & its own impact on showbiz / viewers to negate anything that soured her experience. Sorry Sarah, that's not the way it turns out when someone is THAT bothered.",0.0516,61

The Studio are at fault by making SJP executive producer & paying more money & favouring her wishes with nudity clauses  It wasn't Fair to the others .. All four actresses were phenomenal & now look ....No 3rd movie ...  plus Kim \Sam  hard times with Father's dementia & brother's death. It's the Studios fault !,-0.8306,59
"The entire thing is dumb. If SJP wasn't a friend, then why respond to her, or why wouldn't she treat her cordially as with any colleague. If K doesn't want to do another movie, don't. Seems to me that she likes to talk about what she doesn't want to do a lot. This role was probably the best thing that happened to her career. Two adult women spending any time or energy talking about what they aren't to each other, what they don't want to do is just silly.",0.0895,99
The movies sucked! Totally ruined the memories of the show.,-0.7707,12
"The root of all this is that Sarah envies Kim. When Kim was recounting her experiences from the beginning of the show, it was obvious Sarah felt jealous and threatened. Kim is beautiful and a natural comedian. She was the light and humor of the show. And of course she always looked stunning.",0.7096,59

"Two wrongs don't make a right.  If SJP ""needed to be nicer,"" then Catrall needs to grow TF up.  She's 61+ for Christ's sake.  'SATC' is a BRAND, therefore its awesome legacy shouldn't be ruined by all this petty female mud-slinging.  I'm not on SJP's nor Catrall's side.  I'm on Candace Bushnell's side (author of the book & creator of the series.)  I DGAF if the series is long over -- SATC is still a brand.  DON'T fight in front of the fans.  SMMFH üòí",0.4685,103

"Well damn no one said SJP was perfect. However I do believe she is a sweetheart, we all have our days and moments when we can be bitchy but sweet for the most part. Picture working with someone for years but over time have gained a close bond, even a personal bond out ode of work then later on hat conworker/friend decides to say that you were nothing more than a conworker. Smh Sad! I think Kim has a huge jealous streak when it comes to SJP. They are no longer on the show where SJP got the spot light. So now Kim can right the story however she wants to completely separate herself from that. It's just sad because we're all fans. That's why we are even here. I hope one day they can reconcile their differences",-0.5555,151
"Well, something is not right here. Two women worked together for six (or more?) years. Today, one of them says they were never friends just colleagues and the other one claims to be heartbroken over this statement. Something has happened between those two. And  the one who pretends to be shocked and surprised (SJP) is usually the one to blame. To me, it is so obvious that Sarah Jessica prefers to maintain her ""clean"" public persona and maybe she is being smarter than Kim. On the other hand, Kim is in pain because of the recent loss of her brother and in such a state of mind people don't care about being politically correct. Sometimes, grief makes you harsh. I understand her. I really hope she won't regret revealing too much of her thoughts. People, especially fans, tend to be less understanding. My condolences to her family for this tragic loss.",-0.9465,177
