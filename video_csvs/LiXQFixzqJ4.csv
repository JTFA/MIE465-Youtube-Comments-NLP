This is why it is key that they have to show and specifically spell out that Kylo Ren ""may still have good in him.""

"dark god25  The Reylo thing is much more discreet than the Finn-as Jedi mislead. A casual fan wouldn't see potential Reylo romance in the marketing unless they were really paying attention. For that reason, I don't think it's a mislead - it's not obvious enough to be a mislead.",0.7717,54
"dark god25 Finn holding a lightsaber at the end shot of the TFA trailer is equivalent to Kylo reaching his hand out to Rey as an alliance. The romance part, however, is being marketed quite discreetly. We don't have explicit confirmation that they will ever be in the same room together, let alone not hate each other.",0.8624,64
