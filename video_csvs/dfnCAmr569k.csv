"Taylor, get rid of Joseph Kahn who's directing your dark future. Remember, countries such as South Korea has NO leading position of current world culture, but can be used as a ""just do it"" fool to push a dark agenda. If you know English and with US pop music, you have no interest on K-pop which is a awkward copy. You have no internal personal true life realizations to offer from your music? Take control of your own music, make choice by yourself. Or you are a fool sitting on the pop top but serving as a fading puppy.",-0.7404,112
