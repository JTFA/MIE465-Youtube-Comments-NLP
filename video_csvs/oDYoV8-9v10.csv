"I don't believe this.  Dozens of climbing parties summit Devil's Tower every day and then rappel down with little trouble - I did back in 1992 with my girlfriend at the time. It was first climbed in 1897, but the most popular route was pioneered in 1937, so a parachuter could've been rescued from below, but he certainly should've thought far enough ahead to know that a rappel descent was both available and pretty straightforward.  So I suspect the various shenanigans - including the whiskey bottle, were an extension of his original parachuting stunt.
