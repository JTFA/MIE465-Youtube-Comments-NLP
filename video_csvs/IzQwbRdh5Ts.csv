"Kinda sad looking back now as this movie came out when music everywhere started to devolve into more of a passive commodity rather than an extension of ourselves with the rise of digital compression and broadband Internet. I knew a ""Rob"" who owned an Indie record store back in the 90s and use to hang out at his shop from time to time. He even had his own ""Barry"" tending the store being annoying but still a master archivist of music.  DJing is still around of course, and you still do have some big LP shops around but the small ones are all but gone and not part of the landscape so to speak. I wonder if Nick Hornby wrote a followup to this story?",-0.2992,135
