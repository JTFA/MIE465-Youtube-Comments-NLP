"Now that completely transparent solar panels for producing electric power exist, it seems logical to design a solar panel for heating water under a photoelectric sheet. With the thermosiphon effect, metals also can be circulated through an exited coil to produce electricity more efficiently than an alternator, so there is another way of making electricity inherent in a
solar system. Ideally, a panel would consist of at least three components, a. A photoelectric collector, b, A hot water collector and c. A gas expansion device for refrigeration. The refrigeration unit also is quite capable of preheating water entering the solar panel. It may also be quite feasible to run a refrigerator directly by means of hot water produced by solar panels.
When a solar system is floating in a batteries-full condition, there is a perfect opportunity for using a new efficient type of electronic hydrolysis unit for producing hydrogen for fuel cells or other purposes. Oxygen, the second component of hydrolysis is a superconductor when compressed into a liquid, so may be the perfect substance for thermosyphonic electricity generation

"horace mccraken showed me how to desalinate seawater in st marrten this process back in 1997, this is a nice gizmo, a bit overpriced - nice scam - overrated, really, just another
way to overcharge for a way to collect moisture. 1 gallon seawater, equals about half a gallon 

you got to have sunlight, does not work on rain days, they overcharge for this gizmo",0.2263,73

"stupid to be able to do all that and not have manual adjustments and have to be on the grid, so if power out in plant that is hooked to on grid and grid goes down it is a nice ornament.  Best to use water filters to clean water for communities that are having factories that make parts for that to sell for what they themselves help create. Invent a floating devise that sits on water, made all from recycled material and needs no maintenance and i will pat you on the back and shake your hand. Get people hooked on a computer system that will collapse easily with a EMP, what good is it. Take a old barge, put  biochar  under in massive amounts, put a ""back to eden"" self sustaining floating ecosystem  for  floating islands  for birds and micro organisms and that is cleaning up the mess people like you promote.",0.9337,165
