"+The Fangirl Diaries - I bought a box of 15 lip glosses last year at Ulta to divide between my 4 daughters for Christmas stocking stuffers.  One of my daughters (a step daughter) has more olive skin and darker hair than my 3 bio daughters who are all blonde hair & blue eyed like me.  There were some funky colors in the box of lip glosses and as a joke she put on the purple one.  She ended up looking really good in it!!  I'm not sure we convinced her of that, but some people can pull off the look.  I'm just not one of them.  Lol.",0.7522,119

Ughhhh Tati’s look is absolute goalssss looking GORGEOUSSSS 🤞🏽😍😍😍😍,0.0,15
"Using a blue topper on a bright pink that's either too bright or a touch too pale adds a nice lilac touch and tones it down. I've seen people use them to punch up the redness of their signature red lips too. The key is to use less. Kind of like when people pack metallic shadows onto their lips for those special effects. 

Otherwise you can go with a normal amount on a dark plum or violet lip. Not a normal Tati look, but I see it fairly regularly here in South Florida. 

It can also add a nice midnight feel to black lips since a lot of black lips tend to be on the green side for some reason. The blue topper counters the green pretty well and makes almost a jeweled onyx black lip. For actual green lips, it can turn ones that are a touch yellow into a beautiful emerald on the lips.

Blue lip toppers can be a lot of fun!",0.9818,177
