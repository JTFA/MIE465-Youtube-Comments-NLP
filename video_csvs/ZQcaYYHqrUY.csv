""+J Hauptmann  So it's impossible to kill as many people with a bomb or a truck as you can with a gun?""
Impossible?  As in, it could never,  even in extremely rare cases? No, it's not.  Also it's not impossible that someone could use stampeding cattle or use a jet, or chum water at a beach to try and get sharks to do it.

See almost no one is a successful bomb expert, most all who try fuck it up, blow themselves up, fizzle it, get caught trying to place it, place it wrong doing almost no harm, or it goes off where/when no one is.  
So it is almost impossible for a person to be able to kill as many people with a bomb as it is with a firearm.. Because it's just that amazingly low-skill, high-kill with fire arms, and they are that widely available.  Can't go into Walmart and buy grenades.

Kill as many with a truck? Nope, almost never.  See, where as firearms were invented, and perfected to kill other humans.  And then as a sideline, adapted to hunt as well, eventually, but almost entirely meant for and improved on to kill humans so they are sooo good at it.  Outside of putting 'guns' on vehicles, people have not worked out weaponizing them so well.  Can't just keep pointing a vehicle at people again again,  'reloading' if it gets stuck or needs to get around an obstacle.  

But every dumbass gun advocate always comes out with the 'cars kill, why not ban cars lol!' argument. Except that vehicles don't exist with pretty much no other utility other than to kill. In fact they are not meant to kill at all, that being one thing you are never meant to do with them, and a lot of work has gone into trying to make not happen.
Just like a lot of work has gone into firearms to make them able to kill as many people as fast and as easily as possible.

That argument is about as honest and intelligent as saying ""Well sometimes people die on the operating table from Anastasia... So you might as well make that illegal if you are going to outlaw Crack!!""
In other words.  It's a really fucking dumb argument, that most people are too smart to use and so they are simply trying to be deceitful by using, to make a false point, because really.. They have no good points other than ""I like military style guns, like I see on tv! They make me feel like a bad ass!  Don't take my tv guns!!!""",-0.9976,510

"Here are the facts about this whole situation. The blame for this shooting, rests squarely on the hands of two parties, the shooter and law enforcement. That is not up for debate, that is an undeniable fact. Law enforcement was warned DOZENS of times and was even called by the shooter, himself, stating that he had problems and that if someone didn't do something, he was going to snap. Sheriff Israel is a disgrace to the uniform and the only thing he can do to save his own credibility is to personally go to the families' homes of every single child that was murdered, get down on his knees and beg for their forgiveness. Then, he should resign. 100% of the reason why this monster was able to kill these people was not only because Israel's law enforcement team, as well as the FBI, failed at every possible level, but because 4 armed deputies refused to engage the shooter. The NRA had absolutely NOTHING to do with this shooting. Yes, the NRA is a powerful organization. How do you think they got that way? They got that way because there are millions of law-abiding gun owners, your own neighbors are probably NRA members, believe in what the NRA stands for, protecting people's 2nd Amendment rights. They give money to politicians, who they feel help to support their narrative. The NRA is NOT a terrorist organization. If it were, they wouldn't be sponsoring gun safety programs. All of these mass shootings or firearm-deaths in general can be greatly reduced, if not all eliminated by simply enforcing the current laws we already have and by using basic common sense. It is wrong and immoral to use these kids to forward your own political agenda. Oh and yes, that IS what you're doing because there are other kids who experienced this exact same shooting, who are NOT bashing the NRA or calling for a gun ban and are actually putting the blame where it belongs, on the local law enforcement. Funny how you never have those kids on your networks. Also, just because you've experienced something doesn't make you an expert in that field. My grandfather died of cancer several years ago. Does that make me an oncologist now? Lastly, just because you experienced something tragic, that does not give you any right whatsoever to threaten law-abiding gun owners or members of the NRA with death.

Take away the gun and they'll find another way if they are that determined.  More control over whomever is holding the gun is how you control the amount of people killed in this type of crime.  On the other hand, no matter what you do there are criminals whom do whatever they need to get their hands on a weapon of any kind, but those aren't the people committing these mass shootings.  Most of these mass shootings could've been prevented if we'd have paid more attention to the psychology of the person before they committed the crime.

In this country USA, a great national debate is currently taking place, the big companies of the rifle NRA or weapons factories, versus the American people, the parents and their children. Why the politicians that we have in the white house some of them have received millions of dollars of contribution from these arms corporations of their lobbyists so that they pass laws in favor of their own interests. It is unheard of for boys to buy an automatic weapon of war at 18 years of age, but they can not buy alcohol until they are 21 years old. I hope that the governor of the state of Florida is one of the few who promised a quick change in the laws in favor of the boys to try to prevent another tragedy in the future but the white house does not listen to anything but promises, but I am sure that with the attitude, courage and perseverance these students students if they are going to get united as they are heard by the politicians of this country, and implement rapid changes in gun control and ensure more schools. But what grieves me is the failure of the system and the bribery and corruption of some politicians who should represent us and protect the interests of the people first and not the contrary, with Jesus ahead I am sure that all the sacrifice of the students they will triumph and achieve changes united because otherwise no one will help them. There have already been some massacres in schools and it is the height that even in this developed country is the only one in the world where these fatal tragedies of deadly attacks occur in schools. I am in favor of the boys Because of the change in the laws, also that there is more security in the schools, a record check of every citizen, before buying a weapon and people with mental problems should not have access to these lethal weapons and go up to 21 years to buy a weapon a citizen and eliminate automatic weapons and war rifles from the streets because they are not needed, and implement weapons control in this country, and I think that the government should not cut social programs for low income people suffering from mental problems and autism in this country would be to turn their backs and abandon them at their mercy.

The problem is you can't take his knife away or prevent him from somehow getting a gun of the streets. You're more likely to get mugged than have an encounter with a school shooter. Home Invaders and muggers and people who really want to get a gun illegally are going to do so regardless of tough gun laws. You want to live in this world where if all guns are banned in the US, violence and mass murders are going to stop. No, that's not real life. All you're doing is making sure law abiding citizens can't protect themselves and making sure school kids are in gun free zones unprotected. Gun ban or not, I'd rather know my childs life is protected until the police show up and decide 15 minutes later to enter the building and take on a mentally ill mass murderer. As of now teachers only options are to shield children with there bodies and hope for the best. Laws prohibiting cocaine and heroin sales and consumption don't stop cartels and backyard drug producers of illegal drugs, from entering the country or being made. The laws stop nothing! This dream world Libs/Dems want to live in is only going to get people hurt. Also, if the police did there jobs when these kids get reported for violence, threatening people and whatever else these things can be prevented. Parents need to do there jobs also. When your child shows psychopath behavior and you're aware they own guns legally the parents need to report that shit. Parents need to also be responsible gun owners and keep them locked up and safe codes kept to themselves so children don't get ahold of these weapons. I propose mandatory gun classes and licensing. Making mental health reports or records be apart of the application process. The NICS background check doesn't show the mental health status of a gun purchaser.",-0.9942,375

"The Constitution does not guarantee safety, it guarantees freedom and the cost of freedom is never free. Sometimes it is paid for in blood, even innocent blood. You tell me, does your empathy for loss of life extend to those 900,000 lives who died in abortions last year, or is that where your compassion ends and your hypocrisy begins? I believe abortion is murder and in most cases it reaches the level of criminally negligent homicide. The Constitution gives me the right to believe that but it also gives an atheist the right to believe that abortion is nothing more than a medical procedure with no more spiritual significance than pruning a tree. So yes, while the Constitution does not implicitly guarantee the right for a parent to kill their own child, the Constitutional freedoms thereof, must be granted to all equally. For me abortion is a First and Fourth amendment issue (not that there's much left of the fourth amendment after the Bush and Obama administrations declared war on it). The Supreme Court ruled much the same as I would, on both issues. While our founding fathers could have never envisioned the paramount tragedy of present day abortion, or semi automatic weaponry, or modern cities with populations in the millions, or the capability to travel anywhere in the world within hours, or the modern day communications infrastructure, or modern day surveillance capabilities, I believe in every case they would land on the side of the broadest possible freedom, even at the expense of innocent blood.

You are woefully wrong on one thing. The Constitution does not clearly speak on anything regarding guns, that's the problem. I'm no expert on a lot of subjects but when it comes to the Second Amendment I have done extensive research including four years on my college debate team and one thing I am absolutely certain of is that the framers of our Republic intended American citizens to have the individual right to keep and bear arms.

Can you just do that anywhere? You know, how there is pretty much anywhere, any time at all that you can find a group of people that you can get at with a firearm.  Hospital, theater, school, mall, dennys, wedding, church, the list is endless.  How the building, parking lot, how people's cars or such is set up that day do not matter.  Does for the truck.  Matters a lot.  It needs a nearly complete straight run with no impediments with the people all gathered right in front.  
Simple rooted barricades will stop truck attacks.  Can you put simple deep posts that will stop people with firearms walking up and shooting everyone?  Just takes the city wanting to spend some money.

Want a good hint how to tell?  I was in the army.  At no point did they blow off rifles(that functioned almost exactly like the AR15 that gets used in sooo many of these shootings.) and go 'yeah we use to use firearms, now we use home made bombs and trucks because they are so deadly!
Because no...  They simply are not anywhere remotely near as deadly as firearms...  At all...  Not even slightly as close..

And again...  Have explained this before but you need to hear it more than once apparently..

Breitbart: A report released Friday claims four of Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel’s deputies waited outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School while the attack was occurring. On February 22 Breitbart News reported that one deputy resigned after it was learned that he was on scene but failed to control Nikolas Cruz. Sheriff Israel told ABC 13 that video shows the deputy, Scott Peterson, “arrive at the west side of Building 12” and “take a position” outside the school — but never go inside. The sheriff’s office moved to suspend Peterson, who resigned before the suspension could take place. Now CNN reports that the Coral Springs police officers claim three other Broward County deputies were outside the school but failed to go inside as well. They quote “Coral Springs sources” who said the three “deputies had their pistols drawn and were behind their vehicles” when Coral Springs officers arrived. They said “not one of [the deputies] had gone into the school.” The sources indicate other Broward County deputies arrived on scene, and two of those new arrivals joined with Coral Springs officers and entered the building. The sources said, “Coral Springs police were stunned and upset that the four original Broward County Sheriff’s deputies who were first on the scene did not appear to join them as they entered the school.”",-0.9673,270

 Next we should ban all guns that are not handguns, and if u go hunting u can rent rifles on licensed hunting grounds. U do not need anything tht is automatic or semi automatic

Another could someone please raise the age to buy firearms to 21? 

Another rule i was thinking is if registered gun is involved in a shooting then the owner of the gun is held liable as accesory to that crime.

And lastly abt ur point abt the black market, it is actually harder to get gun illegally than it is legally. Guns on the black market are sold for the purpose of drug pedaling so they are not trying get caught so it is unlikely they will sell firearms to mentally ill people. Also guns on the black are more expensive so  someone would need alot case and i dnt believe someone like nicholas cruz can get a gun on the black market",-0.9442,199

 As for the whole second amendment, u can get tht repealed if 2/3 of the states to agree(not saying its going to happen but it is possible to repeal an ammendment, see the 18th amendment).

As far as your point the armed gaurds and policemen, In the Bahamas policemen only carry batons and it has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. So it is possible to have policemen without guns, we just are not there yet.

As for the black market all i know is tht it is harder to get a gun on the black market than u think, because if dealers hiding and operating in secrecy. U pretty much have to know people who operate on the black market to get what u need. And also guns on the black market usually more expensive so people wouls need to  be loaded to afford one these firearms.


When u say a few bad people will slip through the cracks, are u ok tht, cuz to me tht sounds like an excuse to do nothing.

Also u say proper gun control will not work, well look at Australia after the Port Arthur Massacre. It has 0 mass shootings ever since gun control legislation. If Australia can do it then why not us?

But no. It's the gun. It's always the gun, and no personal responsibility is taken.

If you think stricter gun laws will work, you're only going to open up a void of black market dealings for criminals and those who want such weapons. And with the wide circulatory nature of Semi-Automatic weapons, that's a huge black market. The killer will get his weapon somehow. Another law and ban WILL NOT FIX THIS.

But while the baby is gestating...  You care for that short period..
Well, not really..  I mean if the mother is poor, homeless, and malnourished, obviously that is bad for the baby and Conservatives want any sort of that aid defunded so.. Fuck that baby too.  So if it miscarries or is born with severe health problems fine, great, just as long as it is not aborted. 
Logic, compassion.

""You tell me, does your empathy for loss of life extend to those 900,000 lives who died in abortions last year, or is that where your compassion ends and your hypocrisy begins?""

But you are all up for every other sort of death and lack of helping life.  So strange that it's just abortion..  Not even the health and life of the fetus that you all care about.

So being ok with handguns vs rifles isn't a big argument that can be made. Now fully auto rifles are already HEAVILY regulated. And need a special, extremely hard to get license to even buy them. Full auto rifles can't be bought in most gun stores. Semi auto rifles are necessary for better defense and offense if ever fending off an intruder or animals. Follow up shots are crucial in those types of situations. You may ask, when are you going to use a semi auto rifle for an intruder or animals. Answer- you never know! It may never happen. But I'd rather have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it. Seconds can be the difference between life and death in a self defense situation. Farmers and ranch hands especially in rural areas need semi auto rifles for said reasons. Even if semi autos are banned, lever action and bolt action Rifles can do just as much damage if not more in a mass shooting situation with training. But will be less affective in a self defense situation. A mass shooter usually has minutes, 10-15 mins in most cases. Self defense situations, you have seconds. The only way stricter background checks can get without being redundant is to involve mental health status. And it's definitely not easier to buy a gun in a store than on the street. All you need is the connection. No drivers license or background check needed. No paper trail or serial numbers. No mental health evaluation. Just cash. And I'd say, most the people these dealers sell to have some sort of mental health issue. As far as them being more expensive isn't necessarily true also. Actually shotguns and rifles are way cheaper than stores on the street because most dealers don't want them due to the fact they can't be concealed. Handguns on the street may or may not be more expensive. It really does depend. If a kid has a weed dealer, chances are the dealer can either get a gun or knows someone who can get one. Dealers usually don't have morals. Age isn't a factor. Bump stocks being banned is sort of irrelevant. Because bump fire is a technique. The bump stock was a gimmick device invented to make bump fire a little bit more comfortable. As far as renting hunting rifles would deny people the right to hunt on their own property. A lot of people hunt for food to survive. Making them rent a gun to hunt is denying them basic human rights to survive. The renting a rifle to hunt is just not a fair rule to begin with. Again, there's so much being denied to honest law abiding citizens because there are a few evil people out there. Anyway, the Second Amendment will never be repealed. And guns will never be off the streets even if it was. But even with all guns gone, evil will be done. Look at the package bombs in Texas that just claimed lives. Do you ban bombs? No, because they're already highly illegal. Yet it stops no one from making them and using them to kill.",-0.995,667
"presde34 I know Cruz got his guns legally. Which goes into my point of mental health records being part of the background check. And really, even though he got the guns legally, his parents who knew he was dangerous and was aware he had guns and is dangerous should be held responsible for not taking steps to get his guns taken. The police and other law agencies who have been warned of his intentions of shooting up a school and killing people in general and did NOTHING should be held responsible also. The system doesn't work if law enforcement doesn't do their job when made aware of a dangerous person with legal firearms. But as far as getting guns illegally, a dealer only cares about cash. An illegal gun dealer wouldn't even have to know him that well. Also illegal gun dealers usually don't sell guns tied to them to even be worried about the weapons being traced back to them. Unless you're talking about straw purchases which is already illegal. But straw purchases do happen. Actually, you don't even need to be a drug dealer to sell illegal guns. Some are drug addicts who need the money. The response you gave me regarding illegal gun dealers very too much. You can't just say, drug dealers only do this or that. The situation changes from black market dealer to dealer. Most really just don't care as long as they get paid. Because what would differ between a straw purchaser selling to another drug dealer and the dealer getting raided and the gun is tied back to them as apposed to Nicolas Cruz. I'm sure he wouldn't (if he was smart) say before buying an illegal firearm, ""yeah, I need to buy this for a school shooting."" Most people don't even ask questions outside of, ""you got the money?"" In fact drug dealers who sell guns illegally know the purchaser will engage in more illegal activities. Such as robbing , mugging and murdering due to gang and turf wars. It's illegal to make a straw purchase. And it's illegal for drug dealers to sell guns outside the legal system. So imposing harsher more extensive waiting periods for legal market background checks is unfair to the people who follow the law. Why punish the ones who follow the law? It doesn't stop those who chose to use guns illegally and for evil after a legal purchase is made. Making it harder isn't the same thing as making it impossible to get a legal gun. These situations involving legal to illegal gun buying is so unique and not always the same from person to person. Weeding out good from bad is like picking bad grains of sand off a beach only leaving the good sand. It's impossible and isn't full proof. Some bad will slip through the cracks. At the end of the day America is built and protected by the Second Amendment. Slowly and surely everyday, law abiding people, are getting their rights taken away. Because the end goal for most is to take away the Second Amendment Rights. I love how the politicians who advocate banning guns always have a team of armed guards by their side whenever in public. Because guns protect and do save lives. I dare the Broward County Sheriff preaching take the guns do his job and live without his weapons. Chances are, he won't.",-0.9968,624
"to give every teacher a gun is probably not a good idea, but to say that gun ban will solve the problem is just idiotic and plain dumb. A psycho will find other type of weapon or methods: will hijack a school bus and drive into crow, will bring explosives, pressure cooker, or will just simply obtain a gun illegally. Only the armed security and school personnel may potentially solve the problem. Id definitely have the armed security in every school, and then randomly few people on stuff (preferably those that not in the class).",-0.9732,107
"we have a lot of common sense gun laws, they are not enforced, so what good would more gun laws be if you don't enforce current laws? Unless your goal is not common sense laws, but complete disarmament of the populace.",-0.08,46
