"Come on, America is ridiculous that you can't graduate if you fail PE! It's mad he had to go to summer school to pass PE. America should rethink including PE as a class to pass to graduate. In the UK we do sports in school up to 16, even if we don't do GCSE PE, but we don't need to pass the class to graduate 😂.",-0.6588,73

"PE has little to do with fitness, frankly. I am absolutely NOT gifted in team sports and I hate running (the two things that your average gym class is centred around), and my terrible performance in gym made me believe that I would never be able to be physically active if I wasn't good at those things (I've never been obese or overweight, but that is mostly due to genetics and a pop and junk food free pantry than anything else). It wasn't until a few years after high school that I started getting into other activities - yoga, cycling, hiking, and the like - that my eyes were opened to the reality that physical fitness does not have to involve the competition, social exclusion, or public shaming of your average gym class. These things taught me to have a more positive relationship with my body (including not forcing myself to do things that cause me physical pain) and the environment. Unfortunately, most pubic school systems don't have the money to incorporate a wide range of physical activities that can benefit more students, not just the biggest or fastest ones, and a lot of families can't afford to sign their kids up for activities outside of school.",0.9069,229

Vi W America has a serious problem with obesity. I think it’s a good thing people work harder to be good at P.E. Cuz  they already have a problem with health issues. Imagine what life would be like for them if P.E. Wasn’t important for them.,0.5267,59
