Farve did well with Greenbay and the Vikings. I wouldn't consider that system. Manning made the colts into something, then they had to completely rebuild because they were trash without him, then he went to Denver and they instantly became superbowl contenders and won their division every year. People talk about the d# carrying him to 50, maybe it did, but what have they done since he's been gone? Missed the playoffs twice and finished last in their division this year. Manning also went to 4 superbowls with 4 different coaches, there's no way he's a system qb. As for the others you mentioned, I don't know much about them, but Brady and Montana thus far fit the bill of system qb. Manning and Farve, not so much.",0.5499,199

This led to so much salt in my diet that my penis literally became a Slim Jim; the Randy Savage commercial era kind that had so much MSG that my stomach has turned into Haggis. Because of this outcome, my stomach has had constant attacks from a starving Irish Leprechaun Cult; you see Leprechauns eat gold and unfortunately since all the gold in the world has been used in the CPU's of the cybernetic replacements of our government overlords, they have nothing left to eat and have turned to terrorism as a means of bringing light to their situation and also a solution to their lack of nutrition. Either way, my stomach now has more holes in it than the plot of the movie Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio, which may i add id love to bounce on that boys Dee for 28 days and 28 days later i would become a Dee zombie who's only sustenance is brought on by milking the nips of Leonardo until he has nothing left to give,  but a chunky red wine his Areola's spewed with a narcissistic entitlement as if it were a group of snowflakes scoffing at the idea of the Capitalism machine we call Bed, Bath and Beyond. I Must cut this short, as my fortress is currently under duress from constant assault of nanobots trying to take my rectum as sanctuary from Scott Baio's consistent need to stay relevant. So i will leave you with this...

Dick, Balls, investigate 311, dogs are a form of food in the future, Bitcoins are controlled by leprechauns, deaf people should never do def Jam poetry,  visual aids is a STD, I fornicate with all forms of spiders and milk is mostly bull semen.

Thiessen Yang but he won against the GOAT and performed like a GOAT himself how can you discount that ?,0.8519,20
Thiessen Yang exactly people don’t give credit where credits due,0.6249,12
"Thiessen Yang foles is a great football player, youre delusional. a mediocre qb cant quickly make the reads and things that he can and stay calm. plus did you see the windows he was hitting on those throws? god damn. also he was struggling when we first put him in but we shaped the offense to match him, not the other way around. foles didnt just comform to a great system and start playing amazing, he has a certain playstyle that has to be coached around, but when it is correctly coached watch out. just look at foles 27 td season. you cant tell me its JUST the system. also carson wentz proved he has huge talent, nobody can put up tds like he can. 33 TDs in 10 games. so an all pro qb comes to a super bowl caliber offense and defense and does good? who wouldve thought?!-_-
 foles was an all pro qb thats talent got overlooked because he got injured etc, he isnt just a backup. he is very very talented and makes plays too. ive watched the eagles all season and when the qb isnt making plays himself we lose, the system doesnt make the qb. each qb has a different system fitted around them. are you telling me drew brees would succeed in a mike vick offense? no. diff qbs play different.

also no qb succeeds in fishers offense, that was the only other offense foles played in. so technically he hasnt got a real shot at another team. he just outdueled tom brady, you sound like a hater.",0.9931,300

"htwoa aowth patriots went 11-5 without Brady in 2008.  And that makes him a system QB, right?  Well…The Colts went 13-1 and made the SB without Johnny Unitas in 1968, so was Unitas just a system QB?The 49ers went 10-6 (1991) and then 14-2 (1992) without Joe Montana, they also went 38-14-1 without Montana from 1981-1992 and they went 12-4-1 without Montana OR Young from 1981-1992.  So was Montana just a system QB?The Cowboys went 12-4 the year after Roger Staubach retired, so was Staubach just a system QB?The Dolphins went 11-5 the year after Dan Marino retired, so was Marino just a system QB?The Broncos went 4-0 when John Elway was out with injury in 1998, so was Elway just a system QB?The Rams went 12-4 without Kurt Warner in 2003, so was Warner just a system QB?The Packers won a SB without Brett Favre just three seasons after he left Green Bay, so was Favre just a system QB? The Broncos went 5-2 without Peyton Manning in 2015, so was Manning just a systemQB?Matt Flynn threw 6 TD passes in a game in 2011, so is Aaron Rodgers just a system QB?The Colts went 6-3 without Andrew Luck in 2015, so is Luck just a system QB?Big ben was suspended in 2010 steelers went 3-1 without him.
