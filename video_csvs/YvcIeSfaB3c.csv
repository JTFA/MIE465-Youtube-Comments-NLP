For all Billy Bush's fault & the role he played, I can't NOT give him at least some credit for taking this stand. As others have said & Colbert says here, you lost your job & Trump got the presidency. I won't say Billy was right in taking part of this conversation & not calling him out for it as it happened & as they exited the bus. At least for the part he played, he seems to show remorse for it & does the right thing by authenticating it even though there is no denying Trump said these things. It also says a lot that Billy Bush openly stated that he believes the women who have accused Trump of sexual assault & harassment. The man isn't saying he's without fault; on the contrary, by taking the interview & owning up to the part he played, he should earn some forgiveness, or at the very least, acknowledgement that he's owning his guilt whether or not women can forgive him at some point in the future. Trump's disgusting & continued denial, refusal to step down, & his threats of suing these women is something that he needs to be taken to task & not allowed to continue in his opulent lifestyle for being a sleaze then glorified for it.

It would also make it possible for such claims to become weapons to just exile people from society just through claiming something without any proof.

Whether you believe a woman claiming to be sexually assaulted by Trump is relevant. Believing is worthless. Knowing is everything.

"Very true. That's why they've been pressuring Fallon to be more political to win back the ratings crown from Colbert.

"When you are complicit, you have some blame and guilt. Still, he was not the one saying it, he was fired because of it, yet the deplorables are fine with electing Trump president, because he didn't do it to them.

Look at President Trumps' wife, she's gorgeous, she's well mannered, she's sweet, she takes good care of her family (which is something that is getting harder for a man to find in a woman these days, if you were a real man maybe you'd know that)  Melania is also smart, I can't remember how many languages she speaks, and she loves her husband.

"You know somebody is trying to smear Chuck Schumer with false allegations. Lucky for him, the people who were doing it were idiots. You know the problem with ""All Women Must be Believed"" and passing judgment even in a non-criminal context without an investigation is that now you will get these unsavory actors that will make false charges to try to get rid of their political opponents. A Hillary Clinton supporter was openly trying to get people to falsely accuse Bernie Sanders of sexual assault on twitter. Though those plans are fortunately probably gone ever since the tweet became widespread. James O‚ÄôKeefe with Project Veritas even paid a right-wing activist to make false rape allegations about Roy Moore to try to catch the Washington Post in this ""gotcha"" moment. Luckily, the Washington Post doesn't just believe and report but does investigations. This would have been fodder for the conservative media and politicians should they have went to a news org that is not as rigorous in its fact checking.",-0.6032,185

"i think it's pretty clear that billy has learned little from being fired. he didn't even apologize, and this was his first opportunity to do so. most of this sounded like him lamenting the ""irony"" (how was it ironic, exactly?) of being fired while a sexual predator was elected president. he deserved to be fired. he laughed at a man bragging about assault. if you're a man in power, in the media, you better be damn sure you'll be fired for encouraging that kind of talk. he should embrace his firing as just desserts. that would have shown growth. instead, he actually had the nerve--the insane, unreflective, sexist nerve--to admit he graciously accepted matt lauer's help in not getting fired after we know now lauer is also a predator. billy again should have apologized for being so spineless, and talked about his complicty in rape culture. i saw no growth here. only a man upset he lost his job for laughing alongside a sexual assaulter. pathetic. john oliver would've handled this interview much better.",-0.4727,201
