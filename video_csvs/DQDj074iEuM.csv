"Amy Thomasson ""click on the medical tab"" u used it exactly in this manner on a special needs topic....or topic of a person with a medical issue. Not on political subject or any other subject.  So no we don't buy it.  moron: definition from Dictionary.com: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/moron",0.4282,55
"Amy Thomasson actually dictionary.com disagrees with your definition and describes ""moron"" as a person with a mild retardation. So in all fairness you DID just do exactly what this guy did to himself. However, this guy was making fun of himself and not what you just did by referring to him as a mildly retarded person. You're completely wrong. Try again. moron: definition from Dictionary.com: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/moron",-0.8516,76
"Amy Thomasson hey Amy wrong again. It's no longer In used ""formally"" because it is considered offensive. That doesn't change the meaning. Do a little bit more research before you insult people about special needs with words like this.. The origin of the word is another great place to start and also the noun at dictionary.com you can pretend that were using the 1st definition, however why would you even use the word moron on a topic about special needs children? You have a very bad choice of words as we can see from Maggie who knew what it meant and got offended by your word choice on this topic. How about you stop going around the internet insulting people using words that originated from mental retardation and are no longer USED in pshycology because it is offensive. Good job TRYING to use and informal definition of a word you barely know anything about on a disability lady. So sick.",-0.96,172

"So- LLR was made aware of the situation almost immediately. The consultant issued a generic apology. LLR elected to use it as a teaching moment and to 'double-down' on their sensitivity training. The contract with this consultant (and his wife) has not been terminated as of today.
However, The National Down Syndrome Society has officially cut ties with LLR as a direct result of this incident. 
LLR announced in a follow up post that they are the ones who cut ties with NDSS because they refused to fire the consultant. Which was a blatant lie. NDSS posted their decision to cut ties with LLR prior to any posts being made by LLR.",-0.8271,126
Sorry but it was obvious to anyone with a working brain what he was doing. He was specifically mocking that reporter while paraphrasing him. This guy was making fun of himself. At least this guy had the decency to own up to it and apologize...unlike your orange bigot.,0.1901,54
Sorry but the story main stream media made up about Trump mocking someone was already proven to be false.  By several news outlets.  Google it.  Main stream media took a snippet and made it look like something it wasn't.  Marketing at it's finest.  If you watch the ENTIRE video of the rally you can see the truth.,0.3612,63

"Take this with a grain of salt. Here's my opinion. I don't think he realized what impact his words gave. I don't believe he did it maliciously or as an attack but was making fun of himself. However---- he is running a business and obviously has become complacent and unprofessional and also was not thinking about the effect that may have on someone with a special needs child. In my opinion I think he slipped up and doesn't deserve his entire business shut down over it, but should be repremended or punished n some form.... Maybe this is his punishment. I'm sure he's losing lots of business over it already.",-0.8271,122

"Thank you for your well-thought out response. I don't expect you to respond to my question and my intention is not to be confrontational, but I wonder how you feel about LLR's decision to allow him to stay as a consultant? (I wouldn't want you to say anything that could damage your wife's business. Nor do I think that the thousands of independent retailers should be negatively impacted because of the actions of one retailer.) But I have a really big problem with corporate LLR allowing him to continue as a retailer, no matter how much his sells. (BTW, I am not affiliated with LLR in any way. I own some leggings and I will probably buy more. Frankly, I'm disgusted by LLR Corporate allowing him to continue to represent his brand.)",-0.9267,148

"To those saying the Trump mocking has been ""debunked,"" even the Snopes report on the matter doesn't make it look good.  The ""debunking"" claim is that Trump didn't know who this reporter was and therefore didn't know he was disabled; however, as Snopes points out, the two were on a first-name basis for years, so that is clearly not accurate.

Wait so everyone saying is that Trumps story is fake and other say because the media only saw a few second clip and didn't see the whole story but yet trump is holding his arm to his cheats shakes and done a similar voice and it wasn't mocking anyone with special needs? I am lost because hear you are getting pissy over this small clip and not seeing the whole thing. So what is different? Help me out the fact that One sells women clothing and the other runs a country? What both did isn't right but not sure how one is okay and you want media to take that clip down and this lularoe clip to stay up? Lets Google it because everything on Google must be true!
