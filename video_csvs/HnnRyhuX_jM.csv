"I never said that whites alone build this world, that why I said 90% of it. We got knowledge and tech from the east and as well algebra from arabs. However blacks and the Indians we got nothing from them as they never contributed anything  except forced labor. There are no black inventors I am gonna call a bs there, if they are please be sure to elaborate on that. Also I am the last person to be fooled by history, how about ask yourself why is it that we conquered you?

When we got to Africa or the Americas there was nothing TO conquer as there were no standing buildings taller than two stories. All that was there was a vast jungle of primitive tribes which unsurprisingly they are common in Africa to this day. If you want to make the argument that slaves helped build cities I am cool with that but during the industrial revolution blacks were not the workforce it was European immigrant who came into America for a better life. Honestly all you have to do is look back to Ancient Rome era and Africa was still like that way before whites came and worked them to death. Perhaps its time to be realist of some things such as not all cultures are the same as you can see we were the better people and frankly we are still more influential than any African country to date.",0.906,256

"Krimpus although you didn‚Äôt mention those movies I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen them and not bothered. fascism is the theme in captain America. also I don‚Äôt think white politics is idiotic but I think when whites make movies they make them to revolve around issues that concern them the most like terrorism, globalization, sexuality, capitalism, Black Panther is one of the few times in history that a major blockbuster movie has been made to revolve around issues that concern black people with a predominantly black casts. Some people find that disturbing because it‚Äôs not what they are used to. Also I don‚Äôt think everything white is evil and idiotic. I have watched and enjoyed a lot of white movies without questioning the politics. There have been movies made by whites to make black look stupid, subservient, evil and very few people have questioned their motives.",-0.9745,169
"Krimpus as to what black panther means to black people I can only speak for myself and my little niece. As for myself, I‚Äôm glad this movie presents blacks in a positive light and not playing stupid roles. As for my niece I‚Äôm glad she has positive role models on screen to aspire to like Shuri or Okoye. Although she has positive role models at home it‚Äôs nice to see her want to be like one of the characters in black panther. Movies characters have a strong effect on kids. I‚Äôm sure as a kid you probably looked up to characters on tv and wanted to be like them. For many years she has been looking up to characters that don‚Äôt look like her. She likes brave, Snow White, beauty and the beast etc but think about what effect those characters have on her? Those characters usually have her wanting to have pale skin with straight hair or light skin and when she cannot be like them she will grow up to hate herself. But having a character she can relate with will have a lasting effect on her self esteem and her place in society.",0.9661,219
Krimpus good!! Your money and opinion was not needed anyway so thanks!!,0.832,16
"Krimpus see I say you‚Äôre wrong in many ways by saying the world was built solely by whites. Black inventors in the states and slave labor all contributed to building western societies. The European Invasion and colonialism of Africa helped them gain valuable resources to be able to fund their nation building. Don‚Äôt be fooled by what you have been thought in your schools. Research mercantilism, slavery and it‚Äôs effect on African societies. Also during the industrial era where do you think most of the labor came from? Just because it‚Äôs not written in your history books does not mean it didn‚Äôt happen. America especially is not all the work of a white man. maybe you should read more about other races and their contributions to western civilization. And the world we know now is not built by whites alone. There are chinese, Indians, Malaysians, Africans doing amazing things to contribute to this modern day society.",-0.296,181
Krimpus there you go babbling you alt right racist talking points. I‚Äôm done debating with you. Revisionist my ass. The truth is the truth. Just because your ancestors omitted it doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt happen,-0.5994,45
"Krimpus there you go believing the lies you were taught in school. As a student of European history, African history and anthropology I can firmly state that your worldview is tainted. The notion that Africans were primitive were propagated by your ancestors as part of an effort to discredit Africans. Yes there are many Africans that are not technologically advanced but when it comes to social norms they are far better than your fellow blood thirsty caucasians. Also prior to the coming of Europeans there were advanced African civilizations like the Mali empire, Benin empire, Songhai empire, Great Zimbabwean empire. Africa is a vast complex continent with a diverse groups of people. You westerners just bunch them up and preach that nonsense. How about you take a trip to the continent to learn a thing or two. I bet you will come back a changed man.",0.8257,159
"Krimpus yes I totally agree but there are so many other movies influenced by politics eg captain America, X-men, American sniper etc but I‚Äôm sure you overlooked those because they were predominantly white actors so you were comfortable watching it.",0.8858,45

It's about par for the course for a new Marvel character.

Criticisms:

Rushed character development.

Weak villain (to be fair, I feel all Marvel movies uave had weak villains, and Killmonger was a little better than most, but still uncompelling).

CGI was poor in some spots (boss battle between Killmomger and BP, for example).

The rhinos were dumb - too Jurassic Park.

You prob mean it has to do with white supremacy, but I most remind you that the population of white Americans has been decreasing for a long time.

But I wish they had used Swahili instead which is an African lingua  franca, also the supposed location of wakanda is East Africa between Uganda,Kenya and South Sudan.

"What the Black Africans do not understand is the fact that their culture is ridiculed by the Holywood Zionist agenda, As destructive as the whites with their fake gods and hypocritical American heroes! Of course, I am favorable of the African race and its many cultures, but not in which they do the same shit like the whites! The Zionist Jews have once again managed to ridicule Black culture !! The Zionists depict the Africans as war and power hungry just as the whites are!
Stop this mischief and develop a self-awareness again and learn how not to do it, because the whites have taken everything from you and rushed at each other, diseases, slavery and your country !!
Stop adapting to whiteness or technology and style!
Do you have no senses and eyes ?? The world as it is today is the result of white wars, murder and death, raids and mental slavery by the whites with their sick religions that are just lying!

I am white and am aware of the machinations!",-0.9973,191

Some things just never change.

also black men are ugly (bottom of the barrel in every dating sites, specially the asian one, you know, the second most desirable women after the white female). But in defense of black women I will admit that weaves are the only gateway and their men should stop shaming them  because shaving your hair close to the scalp.......is also a form of escapism ^_^",-0.3832,111
