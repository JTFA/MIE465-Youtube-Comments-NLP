"""Just like in the movies
It starts to rain and we
We're the broken beauties
Blindfolded minds collide and we fall

When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our story's after the end

Like strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I
Strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Memories in photos
Too easy to rewrite
Left us lonely shadows
Holding each other tight and we fall

When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our story's after the end

Like strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Think we got it, but we made up a dream
Cause we've got a pretty look of what we could be, woh
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
Think we got it, but we made up a dream
Cause we've got a pretty look of what we could be, woh
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Not like in the movies
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Not like in the movies

Like strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I
Strangers
Perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh

I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
Think we got it, but we made up a dream
Cause we've got a pretty look of what we could be, woh
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
