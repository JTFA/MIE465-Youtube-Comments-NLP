Trump hasn't lost his senility to say what he's thinking, wherever it pops into this head and he tweets those spontaneous tweets too,but  you definitely can take the  concept too far. 
I was just thinking it would be nice if more of us had the sincerity and enthusiastic values that kid's have,  but in a subtle way that wouldn't lose our feasibility over it by talking it too far... Like everything Trump does.",0.986,144
