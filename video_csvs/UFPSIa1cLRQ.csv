"Baby what goes up, must come back down
You're the sky and I'm the ground
No matter what I do, I keep falling into you
It was hard but I figured it out
It might have taken me a minute
But now I finally get it

You're magnetic, magnetic
Pushin' and pullin' me
You're so magnetic, magnetic
I'm right where I want to be
Right where you wanted me

See if you really love it
You gotta let go of it
And see if it comes back
The only thing I know is you've never let me go
Cause I guess it's really a trap
It might taken me a minute
But now I finally get it

You're magnetic, magnetic
Pushin' and pullin' me
You're so magnetic, magnetic
I'm right where I want to be
Right where you wanted me

Magnetic, magnetic...

It might have taken me a minute
But now I finally get it

You're magnetic, magnetic
Pushin' and pullin' me
You're so magnetic, magnetic
I'm where I want to be
Right where you wanted me
