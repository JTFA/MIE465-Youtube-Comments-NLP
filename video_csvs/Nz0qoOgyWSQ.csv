I actually respect her opinion. I think her point was very spot on. Everybody has a different view of things but I understand why she said what she said. Like for example notice how when Nicki first came out was fun crazy wild but she made a transition and became more polished and toned down her wardrobe and started looking more relatable and it excelled her career so she didn‚Äôt need that cover to be on top.,0.9209,83

"I agree,,,but I'm also a mature adult that's not a huge fan of rappers and rap music so what do I know? Nicki knows her fan base, at least she should, and she knows that her fans are children, that's who she entertains. I do not have children but if I did I would make sure that I am raising them and not social media and any other forms of entertainment. Sadly, she's a role model to many young people and that's what they aspire to",0.5584,97

Do we really expect her to exert her body any less than she has done in the past? She has led with her body in almost everything she does. My interpretation of this cover is that she is basically saying fuck you to anyone in opposition of her like ""get on your knees bitch"". Although its her face kneeling and standing beside herself on her thrown, that can be seen as a metaphor, she feels like she will always remain on top and anyone who disagrees can...",0.0,126

"I haven't seen the cover but I'm assuming it's somewhat provocative, etc. I love Nikki but agree with Eve. It's better to sell your art than your imagine. I think it's ultimately Nikki's choice on how she wants to present herself & I'm not one to judge, but I'd imagine young women might get the wrong idea that beauty beats talent. And that's obviously not true",0.9456,72
I just don‚Äôt feel safe,0.4404,7

I'm glad eve said what she said. There needs to be a line drawn clearly when there are far too many blurred lines.,0.6908,25
"I'm so exhausted by this ideology that woman who show off their bodies and are proud of it are doing it because of a need for attention, or to please men. Maybe this is who she is?? Maybe that's how she's comfortable? Is it so inconceivable that other people might have a different relationship with their bodies than you do with yours? 

She shouldn't be shamed for it, in the same way that Eve shouldn't be shamed for wanting to cover up. People are different, and instead of celebrating that, we're constantly trying to make them conform to one way of being or another. I wish we could all respect every woman's right to show off as much or as little of their bodies as they want. The only way something would be 'wrong' with Nicki's cover would be if she felt pressured to do it.",0.9666,161

"Im not a Nicki fan but Eve is coming off as ""holier than thou"" ever since she got with that white man. Nicki is a grown ass woman and can do what the hell she wants. I personally didnt like the photo but again Nicki is an entertainer so she entertains men and promotes her music however she choose fit to do. Thats her business. Eve should know how the business goes.  Eve is cooning very hard for these whote folks. White women show their ass off all of the time, but she wont bring that up. Seems like black women are supposed to be ashamed of their bodies. Eve definitely sounds like she was hating and jealous.",-0.9709,130

Nicki has been very successful, in more than just Hip Hip so please let‚Äôs not pretend we are unaware of her accomplishments. üôÑ I really hope Eve hasn‚Äôt been invited in this show to play into black women tropes and to be a respectability politics pusher because black women don‚Äôt need those type of representatives any longer.",0.9774,138

"Maybe I'm too detached from the popular music scene or something, but I've always found it bizarre that someone like Minaj is criticized for not being a good role model for women. I don't believe she's ever been perceived as one, or tried to portray herself as such. It's something that's been projected onto her because of her popularity. I don't think it would be valid for me to criticize Marilyn Manson for not being a better role model for young men simply because he's popular with young men.

So here‚Äôs the thing. Eve used to be a stripper. As she has been in the music entertainment she didn‚Äôt have to use these tactics that Nikki has done to keep fans. I would rather Nikki change her image and clean it up.,0.6705,51
"So...you gonna throw the rock and hide your hand? Tell you what: when Nicki is out here, cramming things in herself while a walking STI is rubbing one out in the bed next to her, come find me. I like you Eve BUT you did that. For him. Nicki did this for Nicki.",0.3612,63
Sorry but Eve can't comment on that. Do your research. #teamnicki,-0.0387,13
"Thank you Eve and you're absolutely right.  Nicki is a beautiful girl, and to put herself in this position, is a bad move on her part.  She's 34 years old.  At what point in her life, would she draw the line. Remember this will always surface, and will haunt her family someday.",0.0516,61

What's wrong with it tho?,-0.4767,6
"When Sharon said ""you don't need to take it down to this level"", it really made it seem like she thought Nicki's Paper magazine was a desperate plead for attention. However, that was not the case at all. Why would Nicki need any extra attention when all of her features are or have been on the hot 100's? I personally found Nicki's magazine shoots quite interesting and I enjoyed them from an artistic perspective. It's something I have never seen before, it was unique. And now to Eve's statement about how Nicki is considered a role model to young women ""whether she likes it or not"", I personally think that it is not Nicki's fault if somebody is influenced by the way she appears or dresses. Also, Nicki Minaj is a great advocate for women empowerment, perhaps her showcasing her curvy body inspires other women to be proud of their own. In her Pinkprint Tour concerts, Nicki speaks on the importance of education and being independent. She proves her passion about this by funding to students.",0.9786,198
