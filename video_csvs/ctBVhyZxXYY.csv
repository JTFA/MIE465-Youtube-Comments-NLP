"Just watched... WOW! If you miss #44 & his beautiful, honest, caring, sincere personality, then be sure to watch David Letterman's ""My Next Guest Need No Introduction"" on Netflix right now. It is lighthearted & inspirational. How refreshing to hear his voice, his optimism, & his humility. John Lewis was also interviewed by Letterman quite a bit & it is very inspiring to hear his story coming straight from him as he & Dave walked together across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. His struggle & fight was for all of us! We must never forget what happened in Selma in 1965.

It's only been a year since #44 has left office, but it seems like forever when you realize all the hate that has erupted in this last year since he's been absent as our leader. Yes, prejudices have always been there, but I truly feel we were heading to a place where people were ALL treated equally, but on Jan. 21, 2017 all that changed. #44's calming voice & vision are something I think has been replaced by racist views & violence this past year. Please watch & remember what real leadership is supposed to look like. I hope it inspires all you non-voters to get out there and fight for what is right. This country has no room for racist views, or prejudice towards anyone. We were built on the notion of acceptance of all races, all religions, & immigrants to help strengthen us....we need to get back to those ideals.",0.9557,286

Every other host is too over the top and tries too hard in one way or another. But I get a feeling this Netflix thing might get too political and not be as good as his late night.",0.8377,100

"My Next Guest Needs No Introduction Is Letterman’s Latest Revolution

""David Letterman spent 33 years reinventing late night television. Other hosts may have used sharper monologues or a greater political focus, but #Letterman was the guy who re-imagined what audiences and creators expected from a chat show. After one episode, it looks like his newest Netflix series may be his newest revolution.""

"Now, here is the height of hypocrisy.  At a time “Hollywood” elite are self deprecating themselves in horror over the way their kind has mistreated, dehumanized and abused women, Letterman is honored with a new TV show. 

Letterman, respected and cheered by Hollywood, has used his fame to bed an intern resulting in embarrassing and dehumanizing the mother of his child.  It also ruined the life of that intern.  In 2009, he also was forced to admit to string of affairs with employees.

""Treat a Lady Like a Whore and a Whore Like a Lady.""  This was Letterman’s response when asked by a college employee during a warm-up what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates.  This “joke” had been branded by the audience as disrespectful to women.

Letterman is ok joking Sarah Palin’s 14 year old her daughter was knocked up by Alex Rodriguez.  Another time, he found it ok to joke Palin’s appearance as a “slutty flight attendant look.”  Oh, but they’re just jokes.

So, while Hollywood is searching for the high road for their industry, they celebrate Letterman who has his own sex scandals sleeping with an intern and freely using his entertainment platform to abuse women.  Dishonest Hypocrites!",-0.3382,244
