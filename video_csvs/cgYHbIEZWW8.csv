He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. 

So God is not against us, He is FOR us! 

The Lord came down from heaven in the Person of Jesus Christ to die, and 3 days later, rise again! He did this to redeem us back to Himself, so that we may go Home. 

Friends, Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him. (John 6:37 paraphrased) 

So don't let anyone stop you from approaching Jesus today!

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

All those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

"The NRA is one of the most politically powerful Organizations, in America. The NRA has only 5 million members, but it controls tens of Millions of Dollars in Political Contributions. As far as their Membership actually electing anyone, is concerned, their 5 million total members cannot elect a political candidate. The Political Donations to Candidates, can, and does, elect Candidates. The NRA is so powerful that most politicians will never oppose the NRA.  

There are 300 Million Guns in the United States, in the hand of private parties. There are more guns in America than there are Automobiles. The owners of those guns, vote, and they are very powerful, Politically speaking. The Fact that Gun Owners Vote is the real reason the NRA has such Tremendous Political Power. Gun owners do not want Gun Controls in place and any politician who is for Gun Controls, will be defeated at voting time. This allows Mentally Ill people who want to commit mass murder to  buy an Assault Rifle as easy as it is to buy a Soda Pop at 7 11. So the Mentally ill person buys an Assault Rifle, goes to school and kills 17 students and seriously wound 16 people. 

The FBI not investigating the Potential Shooter was  a big mistake,  Every Call the FBI gets about a potential mass killer should be investigated, and investigated completely. Perhaps the FBI will investigate all future calls they get about potential Mass Killers. 
    
 Could the NRA actually take over the American Government, and Rule All Americans. Yes, that could happen. The NRA could without a doubt get the Support of the Most Powerful Military Generals, if the NRA wanted to do a Political Take Over Of America. But let's all hope the NRA does not do a Political Take Over of the United States.
