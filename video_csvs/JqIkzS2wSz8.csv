"....so a movie about Ephebophilia is lauded as ""stunning"" and ""heartbreaking"".

Now, imagine this same film with a 35 year old man skeezing on a 16 year old girl. Not so ""stunning"" and ""heartbreaking"" anymore, is it? So why does this get a pass? Hell, Milo Yianoppolous basically lost his damned career because of this, yet we're supposed to see what is essentially child predatory behavior as ""art""?

"....so your defense of what is still a crime is ""Well, he's a year older than you claim, and the man who is CLEARLY older than 24 in the movie is only supposedly 24 as the story goes""? Armie Hammer wasn't even 24 when he made Social Network. He's now 31, and he is NOT growing old gracefully (I happen to think he looks at least late 30s at this point). It is CLEAR that what they were going for here was the ""forbidden fruit"" narrative. 

Claiming that the story changes because it's the adolescent that goes after the grown man makes you sound like a rape apologist.

""She pursued ME, your honor! I'm innocent!""

Your entire post is ""Here's this excuse. Also, here's this one"". None of them changed how this is a movie where a young boy and a grown man get together to fuck. Period. You do realize that Milo Yiannoppolous lost his entire career because he ""didn't vilify"" this hard enough, right? Yet here we have a film GLAMORIZING IT, and all people like you can do is heap praise on it and talk about Oscars?

SERIOUSLY ASK YOURSELF: How did you feel about Robert Deniro getting all nasty with a then VERY young Jody Foster in Taxi Driver? The age difference there was similar. So why is that ""icky"" and something to be derided, and the other is ""art""? This is what I am talking about with the blatant, two faced positions of people lately. You cannot claim it's ""different"" when you want it to be, when it clearly isn't.",0.8169,313
"01gharms ... I'm glad your son has a dad like you. Nothing you said was homophobic or insulting. The overall point you were raising is valid and was done respectfully. In this case, all parties were lawfully able to consent to sex. Even if the film had it's younger male replaced with a young female; And, even if there was ""moral outrage"", it wouldn't make her any less able to lawfully consent to sex with an adult. Be that adult 18 or 80.

However, what Milo said was that children below the age of consent, 16 in the UK, *are* able to ""consent"". He dragged homosexuality into his claims, for his usual reasons. He made vile jokes on his podcast. When it was put to him by a presenter that,
 ""This sounds like priest molestation to me.” 
Mr Yiannopoulos replies: “And do you know what? I’m, grateful to Father Michael, I wouldn’t give nearly as good head if it wasn’t for him.”

Absolutely disgusting. Even if he was abused, himself. Even if some his points were valid. The way he went about making them was vile. Not that I think *any* of his points regarding underage consent were particularly valid. Furthermore, to drag ""the homosexual world"" into his warped views, just underscores how self loathing he is. How thirsty he is to drag down those around him, because we don't want to be associated with his views on pedophilia *in any way* 

For too long has homosexuality been linked, by real homophobes, to pedophilia, child molestation and bestiality. I would class Milo as a *real homophobe* ...He puts on his provocateur act, for effect, but if you listen to his opinions, time and time again, they're extremely homophobic. But that's his gag. That's what gets him fame. That's why the Right can tolerate a ""faggot"" as they'd otherwise call him.

He is, to the Right, what a willfully shackled slave is, to his slave master. A bitch.

Anyway.. you didn't deserve to be called names or be called homophobic. It's astounding how some people will claim things about other's they've never met, with no evidence to support their assertions.

P.s I know you used the word ""sodomize"" for dramatic effect. But it's actually a pretty damaging term. Especially considering that the crimes of Sodom were said to be inhospitablity, pride, etc. Not anal or oral sex acts. Yet, homosexuals have been called Sodomites for a dozen centuries. Usually before being hung, stoned, castrated or imprisoned. I'd rather it were a word tossed on the trash of our past.",-0.1345,526
"01gharms ... The *age of consent* is 14 in Italy. In England, where I'm from, it's 16. I understand your point,  and I have not yet seen the film, but he is lawfully able to consent to sex with people of his own age and above. There is a double standard in society regarding male and female sexuality. If for example, a female teacher were to sleep with a 16 year old male student, many people, mostly male, would cheer the boy. If it was a male teacher sleeping with a 16 year old female student, people would want his blood. Frankly, we are lucky to have moved on from a time where romantic and sexual themes between same sex couples would garner similar calls for blood. The young character was of a lawful age. Yes, a double standard exists. It doesn't make the solution to synchronise our reactions to those of irrationality and fear mongering. I mean, there's quite a distinction between 16 and 6!",0.7814,191
"01gharms ... for me, Milo is like the Bible. It may have a few decent  moral sentiments, it might try it's hardest to escape it's own bloodlust, but it never can quite shake off the stench of it's wrong doings.

Or we could compare him to a fortune cookie. Yes, somehow it might make sense to you in the moment, but where is the substance to what is proposed?

Or, we could compare him to a magpie. Collecting sparkling, bright objects to adorn his nest. Apparent in his charm. Yet, never once caring that he stole your silver fork, and shat on your car, in the process.

He is a polarising figure, but I've never heard him make valid points that haven't been made elsewhere, in far less scurrilous ways.

Of his opinions on homosexuality; He seems to get off on invalidating homosexual women. Saying that it's just a reaction to being fed up with men. On bisexuality, for males he refers to it, merely as a stepping stone on ones way to coming out as fully homosexual. For females, it's apparently just for other reasons related to men. On marriage equality, he was obnoxiously vocal on his disproval. Stating that, it was a slippery slope towards negative societal ramifications. His claim was that, he'd never heard anybody really ""wanting it"". That, he didn't want it. But, then gets married to a man, as soon as it's convenient for him. Silly bastard. Affable, but dangerous. Seems to want to validate Republican views. Give 'em something to chew.

He wants us to disavow acknowledgment that we *are* still victims to various types of inequality, childhood trauma, violence, shunning, and doesn't really seem to give a fuck about the bigger picture: worldwide.

The one in which our severed heads roll around arid village squares. We are thrown from rooftops, imprisoned, silenced under a climate of fear, tortured, forced anal exams, raped by heterosexuals (counter intuitive, I know) denied basic rights and protections under the law. For fucks sake, Milo. Are we not victims? Does he want us to placate ourselves on these issues, too? I wouldn't be rather surprised.

We are victim's Milo. Sorry, but we are. It doesn't make us weak. It doesn't mean that we should become the thought police. We can't force anybody to do anything they're unwilling to do. But, it isn't heterosexuals who have ""they must be put to death. Blood will be upon their heads"" in the most influential book of all time.

Therefore, something has to be done to point out how we've been wronged. We can't just play it cool, for the sake of looking cool. Nobody in society should be complicit in this mess. Yet, he seems to be, and berates other's for their willingness to speak up for themselves. Just listen to him in any debate on the topic. Words of a homophobe. And a homo can be a phobe. Even an out individual.

I would not trust him to be in control of my rights. He certainly can speak for himself, whilst, seeming to think he is representative of every homo to walk this planet. People cannot seem to tell him otherwise.",-0.9974,631
"01gharms .... I would have to agree that by using the word ""sodomize"", you are at least partially ""guilty"" of displaying some negative attitude based upon the homosexual aspect of this relationship, that would likely not have been touched upon, had this been the sexual conquest of a heterosexual male.

You would not have claimed a heterosexual male sought to ""sodomize"" a young female. Even *if* we expanded sodomy to it's broadest sense of meaning non vaginal penetration.

It's more than just ""imagery"" to use a word like that. It's framing the sexual deed in a negative light that goes beyond your initial rejection based on the youthfulness of the young male, to further advance your argument.

An ""appeals to sodomy"" fallacy, if you will. 😂


It very much denotes biblical and religious connotations, that are outright horrific, when it comes to homosexuality. Not to say I'm pinning these crimes to your usage of the word.

But, considering the way that the religious have sought to manipulate the story of Lot and the town of Sodom's demand to ""know"" the angels, to justify their persecution of homosexuals; I would say that a degree of awarness on the word wouldn’t harm your case.

You know, I got called a Sodomite for holding a guys hand in public, in London's busy centre. That was in 2017. And, we supposedly ""have it good"" here.

A heterosexual couple has never been called Sodomites for holding hands in public.

I'm in no way saying your reason was homophobic, but just beware of why using that word in that context, does make your reasoning sound a bit off. Especially since you were concerned with double standards.",-0.7876,328
"01gharms first off, Elio was 17 and Oliver 24, as far as I know. Yes, he is older but not 19 years older as you suggest. second, at 17 people are not kids anymore. I’d say most people are sexually active before 17. It’s not pedophilia bc there are no kids involved. And third, have you actually seen the film? Elio’s character is self-assured, sophisticated and wicked smart. He knows what he wants and he is the one who shows interest in Oliver first.
Before I saw the film, I was also very hesitant because of the age gap. But context is key. This relationship has nothing problematic about it imo.",0.8914,135

"Indeed. I'm sorry for the raw imagery I used, but when a stranger on the internet dares tell me, the father of an openly and proud gay young man, that he is ""homophobic"" because he doesn't care for the clear undertones of ""forbidden fruit"" this movie portrays, my blood starts to boil. I put them in the same category as the people who called me ""racist"" when I would scrutinize a leader I voted for twice. It seems to be the ""opt out"" method of debate these days. Don't want to or just flat cannot defend what your stance is? Start calling names like a petulant toddler, making blind accusations and then claiming the outrage someone shows to being called something like that is ""proof"" that they are just that. I often ask those people how they would feel if I just walked up to them in public, pointed at them, and screamed ""PEDOPHILE!!. They often try to claim they ""wouldn't care"" because it was ""untrue"". I told them yes, it likely was. However, in this day and age, very few actually require much in the realm of proof to back up claims being made. They just automatically jump to feigned or real outrage as some sort of societal reflex. 

I understand your view of Milo, but I feel as though your view is slightly colored by political biases. I would say mine is as well, but I'm a fairly pragmatic person. My Democrat friends would call me ""Blue Dog"", a term for more ""conservative"" (at least when it comes to government, the constitution, and spending) Democrats (also known as ""Reagan Democrats"" I guess....too young for that one hehe), and I am called a ""RINO"" by my Republican friends (because apparently, not treating the gay community as lepers makes me some sort of hippie). I have voted for the best person in my opinion in every election, and not once did I ever say ""Which party is that person with because that is the deciding factor"", so I would like to think my political biases are small and inconsequential, but who knows, really?

What I saw was a gay man who was clearly a victim of something that is, sadly more often than we would like to admit, sort of ""not as out of the scope of reality"" as it is for other groups. And I saw him dealing with it in a way that a man like Milo would: provocatively. But it seemed to me like a defense mechanism more than an advocacy. I did not once think ""He's attempting to glorify or connect being gay with pedophilia"". I think that's a rather myopic take on the matter if I'm being honest. And I just cannot see someone so proudly gay as Milo as being considered ""homophobic"". What he seems like to me is a man who wants his community to stop being treated like helpless children who need to be protected and pitied. A message of self value and determination is now seen as ""homophobia""? To be fair, I see that same sort of view of this new wave of feminism as well. It seems that while espousing how women are strong and can do anything a man can, they are simultaneously espousing how men cannot do X, Y, or Z for the good of the delicate sensibilities of our better halves. It's counter-intuitive. 

While I certainly don't agree with everything Milo has to say on MANY matters, writing him off as some ""self hating gay man"" because he wants to be treated like a human and not a victim is a very pedantic vision of him. This is not unlike calling Ben Shapiro (who again, is CRAZY right, but smart as all hell) a ""Nazi"". As a Jewish man, there is nothing quite like watching an entire political movement hijack and belittle the suffering of your people for political points, so the ""Nazi"" term is already a bit of a sore subject with me, but daring to call a practicing, Orthodox Jew one seems a shade too far.

Anyways, my son and I appreciate your support, and appreciate someone capable of rational thought and debate, especially here on what has turned into sort of a cesspool lol. Have a great night.",0.9979,834

"KeKway Blaze ... He misunderstood the age of the young male character! Simple as that! He is totally within his right to voice his opinion on this matter, because that's how we get clarity. I'd rather people DID voice their opinions, because child abuse is child abuse regardless of gender. And, there *are* so many double standards in society.

People can always be informed of the laws, but you're accusing this man of something he never did. Your doing something that's worse than misunderstanding. You're playing a game of character assassination.

Do you not understand that by calling out somebody who objects to child molestation, because you perceive that to be a veiled attack on homosexuality, you *ARE* contributing to this double standard.

You're effectively slandering people who critique anything to do with a relationship because they must be ""homophobic"".

You're wrong. Flat out wrong.",-0.9853,169

Again, I wonder where your faux ""outrage"" was when Milo Yiannopolous was crucified for not coming down on his abusers hard enough? Where were you when he lost his job and his book deals, all because he didn't vilify THIS SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP TYPE hard enough?

Oh, right. He doesn't think what you do. So you didn't give a fuck.

Do you find yourself requiring handfuls of Xanax to live with being such a hypocritical cunt, or are you just so morally bankrupt that you don't care anymore? I'm actually quite interested to know.

The subject matter, however, is this hypocritical nonsense that, again, if the sexes were changed, would be pilloried as this disgusting story of a man taking advantage of a girl. I grow ever tired of these sorts of stories. Seriously, if you can change one facet of the storyline and it makes it SEVERELY wrong, then it's ALWAYS wrong. And I mean within reason. Obviously, if you changed the age to like 7 for the boy, then it goes REAL bad.

I just wish the advocates for certain things in this world would stop blindly pushing it and realize that sometimes, how they push it makes them look like two faced fools.

The movie was not my cup of tea. But then again, I find no draw in grown men attempting to bone 16 year old boys while on vacation. Seriously, would it have been so bad to make the kid 18?",-0.9631,200

And when China goes down (it is going down actually), it will take Canada, Australia and South Korea down with it. I'm personally very concerned for Australia cuz all they have are real estate and natural resources, for which China has been the biggest client for the past 30 years.

I bet the house you cheer on each and every single time that female teachers are in the news for having got caught having sex with their underage teenage male students which is becoming commonplace it seems these  days  and no doubt you wish there were teachers like that when you went to school.

 Your ignorance regarding European cultures is astounding as Europeans are much more open and liberal when it comes to matters such as sexuality and nudity for example than uptight conservative Americans.....  The age of consent is 14 in Italy where the location of this  story of  this book and movie is based and the character of Elio is three years  older than that at 17..
