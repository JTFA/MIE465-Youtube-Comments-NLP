"+Butch Hartman

Mr. Hartman, since you started in 1997, I was eight years old, and didn't become aware of Fairly Odd Parents until about fall of 2000. I do remember ""Oh Yeah! Cartoons,"" but don't remember seeing the Odd Parents pilot on that show... Wow that's a lot of nostalgia to go through...>_>

That aside, as an aspiring cartoonist, hearing how rigorous your schedule was makes me question my career choice. I imagine tearing out my hair under the stress of animating with a deadline, as working on my own deadlines every October and December for my Halloween and Christmas themed comics, and trying to make writing competition deadlines like NanoWriMo is stressful enough as it is. Especially when I tend to juggle NanoWriMo with my Christmas project. So to have to work like that for 20 years and maintain your love for drawing and animation, I commend you sir.",0.8702,174
