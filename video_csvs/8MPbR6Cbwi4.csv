"""This finger-snappy country-tinged tune is a collaboration with singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton, with whom Justin Timberlake has performed on several previous occasions. Back in 2013, he recorded the bluesy country song 'Drink You Away' for his *20/20 Experience - 2 of 2* . He later performed the song as a duet alongside Stapleton at the 2015 Country Music Awards. Shortly after his CMAs moment with the Nashville singer-songwriter, Timberlake released 'Drink You Away' to country radio, and the tune picked up sufficient plays to peak at #60 on the Billboard Country airplay chart."" In September 2017 Timberlake and Stapleton shared the stage, along with Stapleton's wife Morgane, during the pop star's set at the Pilgrimage Music and Cultural Festival in Tennessee.""
""The duet was produced by Timbaland, Danja, and 1500 or Nothin', continuing Timbaland's history of country and Americana-style production for such artists as Bubba Sparxxx ('She Tried') and Brad Paisley ('Grey Goose Chase' and 'Solar Power Girl').""
""Chris Stapleton hadn't originally planned to contribute vocals on this cut. 'I really just went out to Los Angeles to write songs with him,' he explained to _Billboard_ magazine. 'That was one of those things where there wasn't necessarily a plan. He was like, ""Alright, you hop in there and take a verse."" I'm like, ""You want me to do what?"" ... It came out great. I had a blast with him, he's a great creative force and one of those guys that if you get a chance to work with him, you should.' Stapleton co-wrote two other tracks on _Man of the Woods_ : 'Morning Light' and 'The Hard Stuff.'""
""Directed by Arturo Perez Jr. and produced by La Blogothèque, the video was shot in one take following two weeks of intensive planning and pre-production. The clip was filmed at the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles – famous for its appearance in the 1982 science fiction movie _Blade Runner_ . 'I'm not joking when I tell you that this is the first and only take that we did in the night time,' Perez told _Esquire_ . 'Justin Timberlake. That guy is a pro. And Chris Stapleton was such a good guy. I don't know if he knew exactly what was going on, but that guy is a performer, so he just settled back and did it.'""",0.9221,466

"Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still I don't go there

Everybody says ""say something""
Say something, say something
Then say something, say something, then say something

I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)

I hear them call my name
Everybody says ""say something""
Then say something, say something
Then say something, say something then say something

I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
