"Amazing that her ""brand"" was saved by the same people that saved Weinstein's brand for decades. The thousand up votes are 99 percent fake and a product of bots and fraud. Amazing that she was able to get away with serious crimes to be free to lie some more and try to take down her mentor. But I don't feel bad for CK. He knew she was a cancer scammer and a very bad person but caved to Nick Kroll's demands likely because Kroll offered up his father's services in exchange. 

 Her cancer story is also a lie. And, she is a transgender who cut off her breasts for that purpose. She can't come out now because people would figure out that she lied about having cancer.

It's his go-to when he needs to bridge into his next topic. I'm sure half of this stuff is just him messing around. I think the left made a decision to silence him to further this whole ‘burn-all-white-men‘ movement. ‘Toxic masculinity' and the like. Looking back, I'm sure the feminists were going nuts over CK's onstage humour, especially the last two years. His content showcases the female (and male) personality front and center. With the fuel under the feminist agenda, women have become so sensitive and I'm sure his female audience simply can't handle the humour anymore. It was only a matter of time till they silenced him through a victimized narrative. Remember, women in authoritative positions make advances too – we all have our stories. The difference is, we handle it like adults, not children looking for maximum damage by distorting truths. Save the drama for yo mama. The hypocrisy is insane with the left leaning media.",0.9153,215

"I just finished watching the show and enjoyed it, i do like tig, i dont think the show is as good as her comedy imo. The one thing i dont get is why louis ck was still an executive producer the 2nd season if she found out about these allegations after they sold the show. I mean if she heard rumors about him jacking off in front of women why do they make an episode about a man jacking off in front of women and say that the episode wasnt related to louis ck. I dont get why they wouldnt just drop him after season 1 and i dont get why louis ck would put his name on a show when they make an episode about a man jacking off in front of women when he was accused of doing just that? I can only assume it was contract stuff, but i dont know it seems very fishy.

"The Louis CK thing infuriates me. He never did ANYTHING to infringe on a woman's agency, and while perhaps his behavior was strange, it was also generally harmless. That we're lumping him into the same category as Weinstein, a man accused of literal rape, is asinine... and this woman, who was all too happy to benefit from Louis CK's support even after she'd heard about his 'oh so troubling' behavior, now planting herself on a high-horse and going so far as to suggest she suffered some kind of harassment at his hands...

"The comments on this vid are, for the most part, sickening.  Louis CK is an abuser, who used his power and privilege to expose himself to women who worked for/with him.  It was vile, disgusting, animalistic and abusive behaviour.  I don't give a flying monkeys how good a comedian Louis CK is.  He can be funny from behind bars.  And shame on the people here who criticise and judge anyone for not acting on/speaking out about abuse, when the power dynamic is so hideously skewed against women and victims;  the only reason it could happen in the first place).  All of the women involved, by default, were less powerful, and would not have been believed without the collective #metoo campaign.  We know that because people like Ashley Judd have been complaining about it for years.  I don't know who Tig is, but you can see her reaction to the question ""Did you ever have a personal experience with him?"", and the laughing response from one of the hosts is awful, as are many of the responses here.  Hitler could have been the best, utterly genius macrame crafter, but it wouldn't make what he did any better; his career is almost irrelevant beyond its ability to facilitate the abuse.  If anything, it makes this sort of behaviour more disgusting.  And you don't get to 'grade' or diminish the abuse of women.",-0.9258,269

"that was all a part of her PR strategy. To sell such an unlikeable creep who never made it after 15 years of doing comedy non stop. Very few people can stand her and her benefactor, Nick Kroll

"the downvotes keep coming. What a fuckup. She got away with all kinds of murder- fraud on the court, perjury, witness tampering and then a massive cancer scam. Louis CK saved her from obscurity. Bought her a home. Then even scored her a show based on her fake storyline.

She wasn't going anywhere for 15 years and never would absent his help. She just doesn't have ""it."" I can't say if he helped her for cynical reasons or whatever, but it's irrelevant. He put her on the map and how she brutally betrayed him. She can't help her self. She's that rare thing - a sociopath. So fascinating to watch her self destruct. In the end, I had zero power but it didn't matter, some force caused her to ruin herself. 

The thousand likes you see are fake and bought, by the way. She pays all kind of PR services.  No way a thousand people approve of someone stabbing a mentor in the back in this way. It's disgusting by any standard. Unless the I'm a lesbian with cancer thing is that potent to suckers. But, I doubt it. http://alisablogq.blogspot.com/2017/07/dismissed-in-interests-of-justice.html",-0.9936,220
these comments are great. Tig is so bad she can't even pretend to be conflicted about her mentors downfall. Tig is the last thing from great and I bet her show sucks too http://alisablogq.blogspot.com/2017/07/dismissed-in-interests-of-justice.html,0.3622,36

"what Louis did was creepy and gross but I think it's wrong to stage his public execution like this.  It's sad to see a person, especially with such talent, completely erased from our culture because of what sounds like some drunken, boorish behavior 15 years ago.  And Tig Notaro is basically cheering on the lynch mob, and grabbing a little promotional time while it's convenient.",0.6903,72
