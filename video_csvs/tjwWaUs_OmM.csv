"+Cathy L. Magar , Yeah, I thought we did a fantastic job! What I don't understand is why they didnt invite us back for the new groundbreaking. I mean, the museum did threaten to sue SRL after the show, but hey, that was a long time ago...",0.2892,56
"+Cathy L. Magar Hey, Id like to see one too!  Set us up! All we need is a location where they wont seize our machines and fine us $6666 to get them back like happened at Maker Faire in 2007,  and permits.  Easy peazy...",0.8513,53

"Ha, I was at this show back then, it was a beautiful day, and the show was so loud the windows of the downtown buildings were shaking, the light of the sun shimmering from them! It was a wild scene, and SRL is usually not invited back after performance. They're just a little to edgy for the artsy community I guess..!",0.7339,70
Have you thought of getting an artist spot at Burning Man? Seems like this stuff might work there.,0.3612,20
How I miss Battlebots! Best ever. Anyway the fire dept loves this stuff. They have to keep a stiff upper lip and all that to appease to the boring politicos.,0.7177,34
I heard that and wondered what they expected... like they had no clue what  it was about at all!  LOL.... nice to hear from you.. I hear you are in Petaluma Ca now?   Is this Mark?  Would love to see a live performance again... miss the organized chaos!  Be well !  Cathy,0.7458,60
I love Mark and the work he has done creating these apocalyptic art events. I guess you have to have seen one live to REALLY get the power of it!,0.3164,32
"I think on The Pleasures of Uninhibited Excess video there's a clip of SRL testing the buzz bomb engine, and the ensuing fun of the fire department showing up. Love that and when the fake TNT bombs started showing up on beaches...",0.4019,45
Mark Pauline is one crazy dude !,-0.4003,7
Shit .. i remember this.. They wreaked havoc ... the financial district came to a halt and the suits were running scared like they were in Beirut... lol.   It was incredible!   }:>,-0.75,36
So is this supposed to be sort of like Battle Bots with modern art?,-0.1744,15
"Thanks! We're always looking for opportunities to wreak more havoc. If you really want to see some live machine action, set us up! ",0.3578,27
"That was a fun show. I got to see it only by chance, was out on an errand and it took me by there just before the show started. I was standing near all the cameramen, I remember there being a bunch of em all behind this barricade and the V2 was turned toward them and went off, billowing smoke and flame at them, they all dove for the asphalt, and crawled away on their bellies. It was funny, I was hoping that was captured on tape.",0.875,97
This is great. I was there but you couldn't really see what was going on.,0.3716,17
"This was a show we did for the groundbreaking ceremony at this museum. Battle Bots is the popcorn machine version of SRL. They started doing their events in 1994, 16 years after SRL started doing these much more violent and disruptive events. Mimicry (even attempted mimicry) is the greatest form of flattery!",-0.6185,59
