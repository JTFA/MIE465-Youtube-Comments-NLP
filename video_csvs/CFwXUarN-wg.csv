"7:19 this is what all youtubers and/or their audience should think about.  I mean, Markiplier and Jacksepticeye- they get out 2+ a day, but they play games about an hour and spend a while editing.  That takes A LOT of work.  They take breaks and spend a few days making skits, and I appreciate all the work they put in! I really do! But I feel like they should take more time for themselves and not feel so rushed.  They shouldn't feel rushed to get content out to keep everyone around them happy.  These things take time, and the more Time you take, the better.   Pj takes days to get out videos, and they are all creative, interesting, and exciting! Plus, he get's time to do things outside of youtube, Same with Dan&Phil, RobertIDK and Troy and Chase.  You can find rushed  quality content that's amazing, even though it takes a lot out of that human's life (Yes, Ik that they chose to be in this life, and they choose to make their content this way, but they also do that partly for the fans intrest.  The more content they have, the more people will come.)  Or you can find high quality KickthePJ content with fun facts, awesome transitions, funny moments, nerdy moments, and above all crazy content.  Not bashing anyones youtube channel, I love all youtubers  mentioned in this comment and more, but i do believe you should also be completly content with your content.  If you're not fully into what you're doing, take some time for yourself and make it good for you and if you truley really want  to keep the internet happy, your subscribers to.  as fangirls/fanboys, we don't care when it get's done, we just love seeing your content! You should to! Just make sure you get time for yourself in as well.",0.9975,362
