"""Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Britain in 1980""

Wrong. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence in 1965. This was largely because of the British insistence on ""no independence before majority rule”, which the white minority government did not wish to respect.

The ZANU/ZANLA, ZAPU/ZIPRA (political/armed wing) and FRELIMO (Fought for Mozambique independence) fought the Rhodesian government from 1968 until 1980 in the bush war. An agreement was struck in March 78’ to rename the country Rhodesia-Zimbabwe, with elections set for 1979. This power sharing agreement was rejected internationally, and was denounced by Mugabe (ZANU) and Joshua Nkomo (ZAPU), largely because they were locked out of the agreement. The international rejection, as well as the renewed continuation of the war. Another election was held, which Mugabe won. A little basic fact checking goes a long way. Please do not assert that Zimbabwe was a British colony until 1980. It had self rule since 1923.",-0.5736,190

Therefore, to frame this as just a fight over politically power does not take in to account that the Zimbabwean people have been fighting for change for a very long time and that any power that is not Mugabe is seen in some positive light.
