(I’m guessing by you saying not allow certain people you mean we don’t allow non- lds people into the temple) Usually furring the wedding the family other than the parents stay outside of the temple even if they are lds. After the sealing ceremony that takes place in the temple they have a reception party with cake etc. somewhere else. I can go into more detail about why we don’t let non lds people in the temple if you want :),0.4318,93

"*스* yes I do realize that many people aren’t able to attend but a lot of couples also do a second ceremony so that people who don’t aren’t able to enter the temple at that time can still see their wedding :) what happens in temples isn’t  sworn to secrecy like this video makes it seem a bit, actually when new temples open they have a “temple open-house” and anyone who is interested can have a tour whether they’re a member or not, as the tour goes on they tell you what happens in each room. I have been to two open-houses they are beautiful buildings and they are extremely peaceful. I think a big part why the church doesn’t let non members in is because many people don’t agree with the religion and they may be afraid that some people will disrespect the temple, they call the temple “the house of God” so it is very important to them",0.9775,185

Although people around you may judge you for having divorced parents and may make you feel like you’re alone, you really truly aren’t! I feel like people who may live in Utah may act and be a certain way because they don’t want to be judged by the same people who act a certain way because they too are afraid of being judged.

"I'm Mormon, when my husband and I married since no one in our families were Mormon, we had a ring ceremony in our church building followed by a reception in a local banquet hall. We were sealed in the temple later on ,  Many Mormon friends   joined us during our sealing ceremony. A sealing is a very simple ceremony,  there is no exchange of ring or photography.. If you Google pictures of temples you will see pictures of sealing rooms these were  taken when the temple was built or after a major remodeling. At the center of a sealing room is an altar  the bride and the groom kneel at opposite sides while they exchange vows.  Another feature of a sealing room is two mirrors installed so that one mirror faces the other creating  endless  reflections , this symbolizes the eternal nature of marriage.  There are also chairs for the officiant, witnesses and guests who are permitted into the temple.",0.2263,171

"Ida C : I think a large reason on why they don’t let non members into the temple is because some people wouldn’t respect it, and they actually call temples “the house of God” so it is very important to them. Also, when new temples are opening they have a “temple open-house” and anyone is allowed in whether they’re Mormon or not. I’ve been to two open houses and they really are beautiful and they give you a big tour and explain to you what happens in each room :) I hope this helped",0.9357,110
"Ida C I definitely see where you’re coming from but they really don’t mean to disrespect their parents, I think if the church were to let some people in, others would not understand why not everyone in. What I meant was not saying that the parents would disrespect the temple but some people that are strongly against the Mormon church might. I think in their view it’s better to let just members in because they’re the ones that understand and agree with everything that goes on inside. I also know many couples that have a second ceremony so they don’t leave out the people who are not able to go into the temple. Some couples also get married outside of the temple and then get “sealed” later on inside the temple. Because in the Mormon religion the reason they get married in the temple is to get married for time and all eternity. I hope that makes more sense. One of the Church’s main commandment is to “honor thy father and thy mother” they would never mean to disrespect them :)",0.7687,206
"Ida C Thanks for having an actual conversation with us and trying to understand because I feel like that’s very rare on the internet these days, people tend to lash out over the smallest things and I’m glad we could have a nice conversation and actually understand each other!  :)",0.9259,56
Ida C what is the point of becoming worthy of just anyone can go in. I get that it’s hard not having some close friends or family members be able to go inside. But it is gods house. And you have need to be clean of any worldly influence that could take the spirit away. You are suppose to feel close to god in the temple that’s the point and I know that if I was acting on my sins I wouldn’t feel close to him. It’s not to hurt or force others to be Mormons. It’s a goal to be able to go inside and be ready for it.,0.9077,127

Jamie Beeler yeah but just cuz they’re still married doesn’t mean they’re happy. Mormons don’t believe in divorces so they usually just stick it out even tho they don’t love each other.

Or a clean laboratory room, certain requirements must be met to go into these places, because they are for a specific purpose

Everyone is welcome and invited!
 and after the willingness to meet the necessary requirements is met, you may enter.

There are open houses for the Temples before they are dedicated by Priesthood authority for sacred ordinances.",0.9098,100

"Mormons believe in Christ, eternal families, teachings from the bible and the Book of Mormon, and they each have their own personal relationship with God. The ""rules"" that people reference are either ceremonies/practices rooted in symbolism (an element also seen for example in the Catholic Church. If you don't know what something means, ask about it!), or the overarching code of honor that promotes healthy living. Agency is also very important, and kids in the church are encouraged to make their own, educated decisions from a very young age. I have many family and friends who are Mormon and they are good, kind, Christ-centered people.",0.9708,126

"My family & I converted to the LDS church when I was 16. They tell you they follow Christ (as to seem non- threatening/ not weird) but they really don’t. They also try to seem “ok” with the Bible, but they don’t read the Bible. I was 19 when I realized the LDS church was a cult/ money making business. There are some decent people in that religion who really do take the teachings to heart but it’s not Jesus’s church. What I noticed is they put THE CHURCH above God. Every month they had testimonials about how THE CHURCH was “the one true church” or how the church “saved them” it was never God who saved. They taught the girls (from a young age) that you go to college to find a husband, & have babies, tons of babies, to grow the church.",0.7186,177

"Sad that the Mormon religion does not allow people of other religions to attend weddings in the church.  I don’t believe God would appreciate excluding people.

"Sedona Sanders The Temples aren't churches, they are the Holy places where Sacred ordinances take place which cannot be done anywhere, only in Temples

But having a civil wedding is completely allowed

Before Temples are dedicated, they have an open house to the public

Our church buildings are open to the public
This video tells a few things required to enter a temple to keep it Holy because it is the Lord's house for Sacred ordinances

The only religion that won’t allow everyone in which the bride and groom are want to attend the wedding but the church won’t allow it ridiculous no other religions keep secrets and the. Use the excuse it’s sacred I’m an orthodox Christian we have many sacred things in are region however it is never kept a secret non orthodox Christians cannot participate in everything but they are always aloud to view and be there the only place in an. Orthodox Church you can’t go is behind the Alter even members can’t only the priest or bishop and the alter boys no one can’t ever step on the alter unless for communion or other things that take place on the alter on holidays or for baptismal ceremony or wedding ceremony non members would never be aloud to participate in these events and their for can’t step on the alter however it’s not a secret they can watch it Happen even though it sacred,-0.2617,182

"They are part of The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, they do Center their religion around Christ and the 10 commandments. (The definition of Christianity is: relating to or professing Christianity or its teachings.) so yes Mormonism has some different teachings but they are technically a branch of Christianity. I think a large reason on why they don’t let non members into the temple is because some people wouldn’t respect it, and they actually call temples “the house of God” so it is very important to them. Also, when new temples are opening they have a “temple open-house” and anyone is allowed in whether they’re Mormon or not. I’ve been to two open houses and they really are beautiful and they give you a big tour and explain to you what happens in each room :) I hope this helped",0.974,165

We very strongly believe in honoring our parents.

We don’t mean it to be disrespectful to nonmembers but it’s how we’re respectful to the temple:),0.8703,103

You talk about how people treat the Mormons differently and I know that is true.  I have heard many people bash Mormons and I think it is horrible, but I also feel that if the Mormon church would be more welcoming to different religions for ceremonies like a wedding other people would be more understanding.",0.9674,121
