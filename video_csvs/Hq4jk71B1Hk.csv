"Emmy,  

Thank you for this fun educational moment :)

What species of frog is this, do you know?  The bullfrog from China is invasive where I live (in the PNW, USA).  They are killing off many of the native creatures.  Some people go out at night spearing as many of these little guys as possible.

I suppose you are pretty new to the whole vegan thing, otherwise you'd be already bored spewing propaganda over the internet under clearly non-vegan videos about frogs being cooked and not-so-butthurt about these ancient jokes.
We all appreciate your somewhat radical ways of looking after the planet, the animals and your body. Every sensible person does try to do this. However, there are different ways of making your diet healthy and there are other things you can do to not act like an irresponsible tool. We all are aboard one ship and you are not going to solve anything through scaremongering. This whole debate of ""meat causes cancer, Alzheimer and whatnot"" vs. ""vegans are deficient in protein, B12, calcium etc."" is pretty much pointless. Humans have lived both very long, happy lives and very short, crappy lives on every possible diet throughout the history of mankind. Some of them are better than others, but none are universally optimal. For example, I am lactose tolerant and I have no problems digesting milk proteins. However, most of the population cannot do this, which is why I consume more dairy than they do. I also am physically very active, which is why I consume a lot more food than most people. If they did eat the way I do, they'd get fat soon. I could on for hours, but surely you get the point now.
I apologize if I came across rude to you. Do your thing, but please, don't try to make people feel bad. They need to assess their needs on their own, not through a sermon delivered via inappropriate youtube comments. Peace.",0.888,325

"True. But every comment, and every conversation is sewing a seed. It's up to each person whether they want to truly love animals by not eating them or their secretions. 
Also true, animal products cause heart disease and animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of global greenhouse emissions. Also true, that more people are being vegan than ever before because its easier than ever & the message has gone viral. Wanting to be Vegan? All you have to do is align your ethics with your actions and eat tasty plants instead of dead animal carcasses and their secretions. Pretty easy! And healthy and compassionate. I sure hope people start wanting to be vegan more than tasting dead animals for 5 seconds in their mouths. It isn't right to kill a sentient being just so we can enjoy the taste of flesh. Plants taste just as good, but without the suffering for the animals or the planet or our health.

Sensible people don't wish themselves to diabetes, cancer, Alzheimers, and heart disease by eating animal proteins and secretions. Read the China Study.
