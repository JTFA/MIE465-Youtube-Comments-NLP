"Okay so I know that this has nothing to do with the video above but I NEED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PLEASE  xD Please xD It has to do with the new book , I was so hyped ever since summer when the video with the signed copies link was uploaded ... I used to talk a lot about it , I was really really enthusiastic about the thought of having the possibility to receive a signed copy edition ...): And I live in Eastern Europe so it would've been a very good chance ...

Anyway my boyfriend ordered it the next day the video ( https://youtu.be/J8hPlqfcyaI ) was uploaded ( these preorder signed editions on amazon ) and we were hoping for it to arrive in winter,  on my birthday or even before ..

Since I kind of grew up with John Greens books , and some of them really helped me to develop myself because of some reflections in there , I soooo wanted to ... physically feel the writer behind the book . When the book started to appear in local bookstores in my city , I tried to avoid the places with Turtles All The Way Down , so I wouldn't start to read it and so on ...

And the arrival date was these last weeks , only that nothing arrived .Moreover , the tracking service was disabled .
 My boyfriend who had ordered the book texted with an amazon employer ( I guess it was the customer service ? Ah I don't know) and the employer checked the route of the  book again .. and concluded it most probably was stolen ....AHHHHHHH

The ironic side here is that from the moment on the deadline of the arrival passed , I started to joke that ""Hahah I bet it was stolen by some fan , by some John Green lover , in fact it's a valuable edition "" ( valuable especially in the part of Europe far far away from Indianapolis  T.T ) ...  

Please please I need some emotional support right now T.T",0.9964,357

... maybe except for the first one. Of course, on a individual level, all that money given to charity shows the great generosity of humanity. Of course, at first sight, more money to charity means better help to children/sick people/anyone in need supported by these charity programs. 
But maybe the charity is still needed because there is no public/governmental program aimed at cure these problems at their core. Maybe the charity doesn't solve the problem, but it sustains it by covering the real problem existing behind it, and making everyone feeling better about ""these poor childs, these poor sick people"". And also, maybe charity is seen as something extraordinary, whereas helping people in need should be the ordinary, normal, decent thing to do (and covering one's own eyes would be recognised at something indecent). 
That being said, I still thing giving to charity is a good thing to do. But maybe a good position could be ""I give to charity/I work for them/I help them, but I also advocate for a better system so that charity won't be needed in the future"". Especially for people with great influence, such as Hank, who can touch an important number of people with their position.",0.9942,249

"hey john, have you ever eaten the same candy at different points in your life and felt like they tasted differently? For example, even though all snickers are ostensibly made to be the same with the same ingredients, have you ever experienced a difference in enjoyment based on the context the snickers was consumed in? does eating the first snickers unwrapped on Halloween night, age 7, taste different than a snickers you nervously unwrap in the waiting room of your doctor's office? I feel like they do, for me. Context impacts the flavor. My awareness and emotionality change my experience. ""Eating a snickers"" is a different experience every time in the way planting the same species of tulip bulbs in different fields produce different tulips-- genetically they may be identical, but to call them the same you'd have to ignore every other context, from the nutrients in the soil to the mycorrhizae on the roots to the weather in the field.

Hello and good.This isn't my thing and if you don't want to read then you know how to skip the comment. Hoson is a gamer and my cousin and he is trying to get into youtube. He doesn't want much. Not a million subscribers or dollars (though that would be nice). He just wants to do what he loves and share it with the community. He's been so dedicated to gaming and he really wants a fair shot to grow his channel. He is a gamer. He plays old school and newer games. He is funny. He need help to get notice which is why I'm doing this. Head over watch a video subscribe or comment tell him what he is doing right or wrong. Thank you",0.9509,141
"i really appreciate the negative things you mentioned. cause while i understand all the trump crap thats been going on is awful, there are things happening in other countries which is probably by comparison a lot worse then most people in america could even imagine. i still find it hard to comprehend the inequality between certain countries. anyway, thank you for this video, very good!! xx",-0.5943,74
