"Hygge is a part of both Denmark and Norway. As a Norwegian i can say that hygge is not really a planned event, at least there is no formula to make it, it just comes naturally . I can mention one the most hyggelige moments for me. My dad has a house right by a lake, during the summer it's great to have friends over there. We will make a bonfire in the fire pit, bring out a couple of mattresses, pillows, blankets, music and something to drink and snack on (what you like to drink or snack on is up to you). Usually the most hyggelig moments are from about 4pm and out. We would snuggle up on the mattresses outside with the dog as the sun goes down, in Norway the sunset starts from like 8pm until 0:30am (depending on where you are). I also remember going on cabin trips with my family as a kid, and we would make cocoa, my dad would play guitar and we would snuggle up on the couch with the fire on. So yeah, it's about a relaxed atmosphere, hanging out with friends and family and being present, how you want to make that happen is up to you.",0.9493,234
