"Have been excited for this for about 2 years ... but might be DISAPPOINTING?  This looks like 12 video interviews and 2 lesson videos? (total of 14 videos).

Was hoping for more watching her during set up photo shoots while explaining her thoughts on lighting, framing, set design/backgrounds, story telling with the camera.  I hope I am wrong and this isn't just Annie sitting in a chair answering questions and commenting on prior images she has captured.

Don't get me wrong ... I always love hearing her thoughts in interview form ... but there is a lot of that out there.  I was just hoping this would be more watching her behind the camera while teaching at the same time.

I purchased the Chef Gordon Ramsay and it was fantastic ... each video was him teaching how to actually make a specific dish ... and some videos talking about the tools used.  Well worth the money spent.

I also purchased the Hans Zimmer offering and was disappointed ... it was more just an interview hearing his thoughts ... but he hardly touched the piano and showed how he actually scored a film or even a few scenes.  Again ... love hearing their thoughts ... but expect these lessons to be more hands on like the Gordon Ramsay ... especially at $90 a pop.

Interviews are fine ... but there is a lot of that all over the web in written and video form.  I'm hoping the Annie lessons have more hands on lesson material then what is suggested from this video as well as the written descriptions that accompany each of the 14 lesson videos.

Either way ... thanks for finally putting this out after over 2 years of having ""coming soon"" on your website :)",0.9905,319

I don't find current celebrities for instance, as interesting or mysterious as generations before them and that's in no way related to Annie's photography or anyone else's. Social media and celebrity culture have taken a lot away from a star's mystery. A more vulnerable portrait taken today is nowhere near as interesting as one taken 20 years ago due to the fact that we now see a lot more of a public figure and its become a lot more acceptable, even necessary to use too much post production on a photo. I was simply offering my opinion and not stating a fact.",-0.0258,138

"I hear ya @hellaBayAr3a ... But I think you misunderstood my rant ...

My simple point is ... I can watch hundreds of interviews with Annie Leibovits ... where she discusses her photos ... and tells great and entertaining stories.  And I love each and everyone of those that I have watched.

I can also read hundreds of insightful articles and interviews where Annie has offered so much of her life lessons for us all to appreciatively absorb and learn from.

However ... If i were to pay a premium of $90 ... I would hope and expect to get something more/different from all those other free resources.

By no means to I expect a ""Photography 101 lesson"" from the legendary Annie Leibovitz.  But what I do expect after such a long two year delay on such an anticipated lesson package ... is a lesson package full of lessons.

Not just a simple interview.

I'm sure from the first second to the last second of this lesson/interview package ... there will be many ""gems"" of information.  I just hope it's not a normal interview with a few hidden gems.

As far as your sarcastic questioning of ""culinary tools and specific dishes from Ramsey? Buy a book."" ... Well I can tell you from experience it was amazing to hear Ramsey talk about the tools of his trade especially knife selection and maintaining ... I also loved hearing his discussion on choosing ingredients and how to handle them properly.  And these are only two of the things that make the Ramsey lesson package well worth the $90 entrance fee.

So ... no I don't expect Annie to talk about what 85mm means on a lens or how to do a simple generic three point light setup.  But it would be great to hear her thoughts on why she personally chooses specific focal lengths and why/how she sets up lights and makes lighting choices for her individual artistic visions.

I would also love to see several real world photo shoots with a camera looking over her shoulder and hear her explain her process as she works.  So you can see her process and decision making as it occurs in real time.

No one in their right mind would expect someone of her stature to do a basic lesson package that any first year student of photography could release and sell themselves.  But I think any serious student of photography would expect a lot more from Annie Leibovitz and Masterclass.com when it comes to their offering for $90.

I'm still hopeful that it's $90 well spent.  But from what I have seen in the promo video as well as what I read in the website description of this lesson package ... I have deduced (hopefully wrongly) that it is just a 12 video interview with 2 extra video lessons.

I hope I am wrong.",0.9905,521

I see where you're coming from. The photos are certainly not bad but I feel like a lot of her best work was due to the subject more so than style. She's a legend and a major talent but her more recent work isn't all that impressive because the people she's photographing and all the post production takes away from it. Her pregnant Demi Moore photo is insanely iconic but then you see photos she's taken of Jennifer Lawrence and there's nothing special about them. great photos but forgettable.,0.9484,94
