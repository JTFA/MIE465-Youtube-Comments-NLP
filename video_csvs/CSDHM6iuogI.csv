"Actually if you move the landing burn 8s later the vessel has more relative velocity to the landing pad, the landing burn would need to have more thrust to slow it to the correct speed for the land, this creates more G-force on the whole vessel applying extra stress.

"Colton Broughton the slow speed before landing is 6.75mph = 3m/s, as said in the video. Since it travels for 10s like that, it slows down to that speed 30m above the surface. 

Let's assume that the vehicle falls at a speed of 200m/s before the landing burn. At the moment, the vehicle executes the burn 30m higher than it needs to, and descends the excess at 3m/s. It could start the burn 30m lower, in order to save the most fuel, so that it slows to its landing speed perfectly as it lands.

By dropping 30m lower, it spends a little longer falling, roughly 30m/200m/s = 0.15s more falling. Working out the added speed due to gravity ignoring drag, 9.8*0.15 = 1.47m/s.

I don't think an added deceleration of 1.47m/s wil cause massive damage to the rocket.

Note: starting the burn 10s later isn't the same thing - if it's falling at 200m/s, it would fall at least another 2km before the landing burn. If it starts the landing burn normally at 2km, it would just crash if it started 10s later.",-0.6079,227
"Colton, not accurate. If you noticed before the burn even happened the craft was decelerating due to the atmospheric drag. It would make little to no difference to suicide burn later. It's likely the confidence level of the landing software/hardware that's preventing them from doing a hoverslam, not to say it's not capable. I would like to know however- if this lifter is capable of anything more then sub-orbital flight, that's the question that has yet to be answered.",-0.8625,90
"Colton: it spends 10 seconds or so at constant velocity, no acceleration or deceleration. Aiming a bit lower than that and spending only 2 seconds or so at constant velocity doesn't change the rate of acceleration, it just means that there's not as long of a constant-velocity phase.",-0.5267,53

"Dear Mr Bezos. I like your ideas for the most part and I like your rocket! Hydrogen and oxygen burning will not ruin the planet like the other guys propellants will. Before you don't read this, I am the guy who pointed out in a tweet to the spaceX people they could leave the landing gear off and have robotic landing gear on the landing pad position itself relative to the landing rocket in such a way as to embrace it upon landing. This of course will save weight. Not to mention save having to manufacture landing gear for each rocket. I expected some acknowledgement but they have gone ahead in the past year or two and built a prototype. I have pictures of it. Anyway, I'm sure you're probably busy disrupting an industry, but bear with me. I knew at the time I divulged this on twitter I had six months to patent the robotic landing gear which could service any landing rocket. I did not. But from the pictures I can see what they are working on is sub-optimal. Get in touch with me for the full design including the important implementation process. I'm not going to go beating on any office doors and you can ignore me, no big deal if you do or do not. I understand how busy you must be! Anyway I have enough income for a mediocre life and I have enough time to think about things that take a very long time to think about and are more important to me than contributing to the bustle. Good luck with your space program! That's more than I can say for Elon. Sincerely nobody elses, JT",0.9708,305

He wants reliable engines that last a long time. They don't just make smokey engines. In rocketry everything has a logical reason. And you could run a merlin on rp-1 and have crystal clear exhaust but it will probably blow up at some point.

"Just wanted to note that running engines fuel-rich is typically necessary for the engines to survive. Temperatures in the combustion chamber would be unacceptably high and something would burn through - probably the dome at the top, that's often where failures are. I would expect it would blow up within a few seconds of runtime. It's worth noting that running engines slightly fuel-rich is actually better for engine performance. The average molecular mass (per molecule) in the exhaust decreases, which makes nozzles more efficient.

It's less terrible on car engines - though it's not good for the engine - and it's actually desirable in jet engines because they're designed for tons of air. Also, most of that air is just nitrogen: when it's all LOX, everything can get very hot, very fast.

The dirty part of the first stage is soot, or carbon, from incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. This can't happen on a hydrolox engine because no carbon compounds are produced.",-0.5836,180

That landing looked harder than 1 mph.,0.0,8
That landing was 1 mph???...made a pretty big burm pop up in the dirt for 1 mph..was this supposed to be a real thing or just a computer animation?? I'm confused!,-0.4122,41
"That makes no sense. They flown 7 missions, they could hoverslam if they wanted to. But if you have the margins, there is no good reason to hoverslam when you can instead gently land.",0.3612,39
That rocket seems to be missing two spherical fuel tanks attached to its sides on the bottom,-0.296,17
That was SICK!,-0.6514,4
That's great that space is becoming more commercial nowadays. Nice job guys!,0.8154,14
"That's great, but you guys have GOT to start sending people up. One of my pet peeves with the X-Prize was that a requirement (spirit of the goal) that a rocket was to send a crew of three up to 100 kilometers and back twice within two weeks in order to win the prize. That goal has still not actually been met. Scaled Composites never actually did this, or anyone else. They just flew the flights with the pilot and ""ballast"" to simulate human passengers. Spaceflight is risky, but so is testing without doing. GO!",0.906,109

The capsule landing was certainly faster than 1 mph. More like 10 mph.,0.6361,15
The dirt was from the last moment thrust of the landing system. All happens in the last moment of the last second. Pretty darn cool!,0.5255,28
"The excessive steam at takeoff may be due to the water sound suppression system, which sprays water under the rocket to stop the sound of the engine from destroying everything near it.",-0.7003,34
The good reason to hoverslam is to know that you can do it in order to get the maximum margin out of your rocket.,0.4404,25
"The slow landing is less efficient than SpaceX's ""hoverslam"", the longer your landing burn lasts the more fuel you are using.",0.3626,25
