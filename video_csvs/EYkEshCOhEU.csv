"Hi Nicole let me just say I love you!! You are my absolute favorite an just because of you I’ve done my hair red like you did a couple of years back!! You’ve inspired in so many ways even up to the point were me an my daughter have made our own channel! Just something for us to do together an keep her grounded as well she loves everything that’s makeup! An so we have our first video already! I don’t have a camera so I use my iPhone an Snapchat  to do the recording an plus it’s a fun way I think but tell me what you think https://youtu.be/7NUbgCm3NYY

I definitely blessed you out loud when you sneezed 😂 also I love the natural brow look so much!!!!!,0.9379,22
I don’t know why but I always feel like that blush almost looks like you have a fresh forming bruise starting or something every time u use it. It’s so deep looking it looks like you got punched. Maybe it’s an old bruise appearance. I don’t know. Either way I looks off. I know you love it and that great but maybe look at it on video or pictures and see.,0.978,85
I get so paranoid when it comes to lipstick I can‘t even wear nude because I have to constantly check if it‘s still there and worry about it when I‘m drinking and eating 😅,-0.6361,40

"I watched this video because of the brows👍🏼❤️ I have been putting Rogaine on my brows after I heard that Lily Gallichi swears by it. I also sometimes dab a little Revitalash on the bald patches, and I have noticed more hair growth. I feel like I do the brow equivalent of a comb over when I shape my brows sometimes, but I feel like my patience thus far is getting me so close to where I want to be with my brows. Let’s keep up the good work together!",0.8917,102
"I wish u were post more videos! I just learn so much from u. Not just makeups wise, but how u handle life and how strong and real and funny you are.
