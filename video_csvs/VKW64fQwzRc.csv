"+Alexander lp   Not really, since they did win in 2014.  It's just that they had the best record the last two years and lost in the Grey Cup both times to teams that they should have been able to beat.",0.7845,44
"+AllPro777    I disagree.  CBC used to show only a few games (maybe two a week at most).  Many of the home games were blacked out (unless the game was sold out the day before) to avoid people watching it for free on CBC.  TSN paid much more money to the CFL, so local games are no longer blacked out.  In 1982,  I lived in Edmonton (about 12 blocks from the stadium) and they blacked out the home playoff game.   I was a student and couldn't afford to go to the game, so never saw it.  It was even on NBC in the U.S. because of the NFL player strike, but even NBC was blacked out in the city on cable.  How is that good for the CFL, when only those who could get to the game could watch it?    You could only watch 9 regular season home games per year on TV.  
Now, every regular season and playoff game (not just away games) is available to watch just by having TSN, which most people with cable do anyway.  
Maybe you think it's odd that we have no one dollar bill, but why does the U.S. have pennies?  What can you buy with a penny or ten pennies?   Or even 50 pennies?   I hope they soon get rid of the nickel here, because even that is nearly worthless.  Just round to the nearest ten cents if someone pays with cash, which almost no one does anyway.",-0.8025,286

"+Jimmy Green   Field is still in yards, but 110 (which is close to 100m) instead of 100.    Also 12 men on the field per team instead of 11.",0.0,34
"+My3dviews CBC only showing a game or two a week was fine, it was national broadcast. Everyone could see the game. TSN is cable, lots of people can't see the games.

Doesn't matter if local games aren't blacked out if they can only be seen on TSN. If one doesn't have TSN they're screwed. The very idea of the Grey Cup only being available on cable is crazy. I can only imagine the shitstorm that would happen if the Super Bowl were only available on ESPN. The most important games especially should never be limited to cable.

Actually, the U.S. penny is in high demand. When you pay in cash you almost always get a penny in the United States. From my experiences in Canada Canadians just round things up or down and that must be the cultural norm there, but in the United States that would cause a huge argument. Americans want exact amounts to the penny.",0.7425,178

"For me and most CFL fans, the ability to watch all the games is very important, especially when your own team is playing.   One or two games with blackouts meant that a person saw their local team on TV only about four or five times per year vs 18 times now with TSN.   

Almost 10 million people watched at least part of the game.  That's about 30% of the population.  https://www.cfl.ca/2017/11/27/105th-grey-cup-presented-shaw-earns-10-increase-viewership-tsn-rds 

People often get together to watch the Grey Cup, as the do with the Super Bowl, so even if you don't have TSN in Canada, you can still watch it at someone else's place or at a sports bar.  

Just because you get a penny or two in change doesn't make them worth anything.  All they do is waste people's time in checkout lines when people are trying to get exact change.   Plus they cost more to make than they are worth.   In Canada, most people don't pay with cash anyway, so pay to the exact cent with credit or debit cards.
