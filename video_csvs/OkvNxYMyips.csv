"La Casa del Taichoro 
Good question.
It's illegal to purposely form a monopoly. Like, if Microsoft and Apple were to merge the government wouldn't allow that since they are each others big competitors.
However, it's legal for a company to be a monopoly. Using the example from before, lets say Microsoft and Apple didn't merge and Apple products stopped selling. Eventually Apple would stop being a company and drop out. Then Microsoft would have a monopoly because Apple dropped out.
It's illegal to purposely form a monopoly but it isn't illegal to have a monopoly.",-0.8585,106

"Me too. There were rumors that the game has been in the works last year, the reason why they probably didn't announce it was because Marvel didn't put X-Men or Fantastic Four in video games before since it helped promote Fox's X-Men and Fantastic Four, but since the Disney Fox deal happened, I think it's highly likely that the game will be announced during E3 2018, also X-Men Legends 3 or reboot could happen, also X-Men can come back in Lego Marvel superheroes 3, they weren't in 2 or even have their own solo lego game. Also come back in Marvel vs Capcom franchise, also in Disney Infinity. Also more lego sets will be released in stores, more merchandise of X-Men and Fantastic Four.
