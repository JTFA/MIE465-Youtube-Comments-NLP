Not because of her ridiculous hair color, not because of what she wears. Still looks like big brother hand me downs. Not flattering,   Weird hair color and dressing stupid just because the media, and the left tell you that's hot when it's not, is sad (Pier preasure). Have you ever read the Emperor's New Clothes. Guys would love to see her in her real Hair  color, none or light makeup, and dressed attractively. That's what's hot. Guys want REAL not plastic. Have a good one.",0.9386,130
