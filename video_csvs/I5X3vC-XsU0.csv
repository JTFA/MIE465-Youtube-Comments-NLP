increasingly, threatening our own survival!

By seasons two and three we had a wonderful time. In this new trailer the Robot already sounds terrible and if they make Dr Smith anything more than a bumbling mischievous stowaway we're in trouble with this show.

1582
Heliocentricism as invented by Copernicus is used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar.

1601
Telescope invented

1609
Johannes Kepler published his Heliocentric laws of planetary motion, based on the writtings of Tycho Brahe.
   Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) died prior to the invention of the Telescope.

1610
Galileo Galilei, claims to see Spaceballs orbiting about one another.
   Galileo is a beneficiary of the Jesuit payroll.

*1611*
Christopher Clavius, a Jesuit at the Collegio Romano, confirms Galileo‚Äôs observations of planetary motion.
   Jesuits claim that Lights they observe through their Telescopes are in fact Spaceballs that orbit about one another.

*The reader will note, that from this point on ""verifiable reality"" has been replaced with Theoretical Math Equations (pretend).*

1687 
Sir Isaac Newton, invents the theory of Gravity establishing a friction-less environment required for Spaceballs to orbit about one another.

1798
Sir Henry Cavendish invents the MASS of the Earth and the Mass for all other Spaceballs. He was the first to calculate the gravitational constant [G], showing how Spaceballs orbit about one another in the vacuum of space.

1865 
Jules Verne publishes, From the Earth to the Moon

1883
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky writes Free Space on use of jet propulsion in vacuum of space

*1903*
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (USSR), inspired by the writings of Jules Verne, published ""The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Rocket Devices"", showing that the man-made construct called Space was a physical place that could be explored.

   *Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, is known as the founding father of astronautics*

*1931*
Jesuits invent Big Bang theory (aka, Cosmic Egg or Primeval atom)

*1932*
Drawing by Tsiolkovksy for the film ‚ÄòCosmic Voyage‚Äô showing a cosmonaut exiting a rocket via an airlock into the vacuum of Space.

Sir Arthur C. Clarke invents geostationary satellite communications for his Science Fiction stories.

*It was Science Fiction writers who invented the properties of SPACE, SPACEBALLS and GRAVITY; these Fairy tales then entered major Universities under the guise of THEORETICAL Physics (pretend) and a New World Religion was created called SCIENTISM.*",0.91,507

They showed his name and I knew this had to be a remake of something. Like they were hinting that we were supposed to know will. I‚Äôve never watched the old movie,0.3612,36
They showed on brief teaser and not an official Trailer yet. The Robot is already on board the ship They are probably making us wait to see him until the official trailer comes out It's hard to judge an entire series based on a brief teaser ad,-0.5267,48

"This may not have anything to do with SJWs and political correctness. After Battlestar Galactica became a breakout hit, producers felt compelled to ""pull a Battlestar Galactica"" and switch up characters' genders in reboots because, well, it worked for nuBSG. The reboot of V did just that hoping to out-nuBSG nuBSG. And nuBSG turned out to be the most politically INcorrect series of the new millennium. There's still some thinking that ""if I do what nuBSG did, MY reboot will be a runaway hit.""

Turns out, that's not necessarily so. V tanked after two truncated 13-episode seasons.",0.6249,116
This seems ok but they didn't show the robot or  who is playing Dr. Smith they have to nail the casting for that if they want this show to do well.  Not sure who the black girl is going to be on the show but I always felt they needed to expand the crew on the ship to build alternative  story arcs and to have a few expendables  as well.,0.9253,73
This show was one of the top 10 most anticipated new Netflix shows in February 2018! https://youtu.be/u4wK5a4lEkg,0.2714,18

"Well, I see they had to go PC and include a minority person.
Why do they ALWAYS have to change the original with a remake?
The Black is Judy Robinson.
So now explain how a white couple have a black child. Don't say adopted. That isn't the way the original was.
I don't have NETFLIX anyway, so I won't be watching this abomination.
Besides, it was already done as a movie.

"Wow... I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt change the main character, Will Robinson, from a boy to a girl in this new leftist propaganda age of television and movies(especially, in reboots). Of course, they still added one racially ambiguous character, in a white family, for diversity sake. I‚Äôm curious to see how Netflix, most likely, overly feminized this once great television series, as they do with vast majority of their properties.",0.743,91

"i was in the living room watching Netflix and my dad started talking to himself i walked to the computer room and i was like what and then he explained it's a new Netflix show there making based of his favorite childhood show and then him and I watched the first hour of the movie and then found the original show on Hulu and watched the first episode now i'm confused as hell on how this Judy exists and we spent like an 30 minutes debating on the likelihood of each theory . 

 Adoption There are 2 versions of this in my opinion the first being that when John and Murren were younger they got into the whole this world is doomed because of overpopulation control let's not bring another child into it let's just adopt one but then why do Penny and Will exist another one in the adoption being that Judy's real parents and the robinson's were friends and when she was little her real parents died and they took her in as their own   
My dad‚Äôs thoughts were kinda mostly jokes but one being that Murren was a hoe or that Judy is someone else's kid that murren had before her and john met after all in the original show there is a 8 year difference between Judy and Penny
 We searched the internet and found nothing other then people saying the same things as us.  My current thought is it‚Äôs just a way to get me to watch at least somewhat like i wanna watch it now just to find out how she exists and if one of the thoughts is close to right",0.7169,283
