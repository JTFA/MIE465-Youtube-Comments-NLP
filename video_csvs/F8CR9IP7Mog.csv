"THE WAVE LYRICS

[Verse 1: Lia Marie Johnson]
I'm waiting at the shore with my arms wide open
Wind blowing in my hair, let the sea salt soak in
Coming at me full force, do this with my eyes closed, yeah
Just like that, do it like that 'cause when I get shy
Slow motion in your backseat, baby
I'm down for whatever it takes me

[Chorus: Lia Marie Johnson]
I ride it like a wave
I ride it, I ride it like a wave
I ride it, I ride it
