"You are assuming that ""rape culture"" is only meant to apply to women. It is not. Women are just its most frequent victims. The term and concept of rape culture was actually identified and created by a group of men in a Lofton, VA prison in 1975. It basically describes a sort of caste system where some people are understood to have greater privileges with the lives and bodies of those in lower positions of power, and others are understood to have fewer rights of refusal. It's not gender specific, in fact one of the main and most harmful assumptions we make in a rape culture is that an erection is the same thing as consent. It isn't.
