HAS a lot more land and locations to build. And most rich people AND company“s  treat themselves or award them tickets to attend the masters golf tournament @ the Augusta national’s golf course located 130 miles from ATL. A lot of  wealthy people, buy extra homes in Augusta just for the tournament. Also the cost of living is relatively low.. better area to raise family. Columbia SC.  Is located only 180 miles from ATL. And is home to one of UPS major shipping hubs( although Amazon wants to get into it delivery service I’m sure it will still use outside shipping companies)...

"Funny, but realize that the articles written about Chicago's bid related to the tax program were erroneous and lacked good journalism/research. It started from one article which got it wrong, then others followed without doing the research for themselves to make sure it was actually right. This isn't mentioning that the details of the bid weren't really made public other than the sites offered and the total incentive value - no details underneath that.

Regardless, even if the program they mention is included, the articles still got it wrong. First of all, the plan was modified and signed into effect in August/September. The program gives tax credits of a certain percentage for each net new job created within a certain agreed upon time frame. The old program said 100%, which is what the articles stated. Even though the bill had been passed a few months before these articles were written, it quoted the 100% figure. The plan that was modified and passed in August/September lowered it to 50%.  There are also goals on here, meaning if the agreement is 50,000 jobs by 7 years to the date, and that date comes and they have created 45,000 net jobs, they would not get a tax credit. The articles make it seem as if the money goes back to Amazon fully. Again, the 100% figure is wrong - the articles did not get this right and people were so lazy with journalism that they failed to fact check this. It's also a tax credit, not money that goes to the company. They also assumed that it includes this program, even though the bid details weren't made public enough to know whether or not that's actually true. The total figure of over $2B was quoted - details under that ? Not public yet.

Also, the modified bill makes it harder for companies to even qualify and to quote a Crains Business Journal article ""The new Edge tax credit plan also toughens language to qualify, saying that applicants must provide evidence that the incentive was ""essential"" to making an Illinois facility price-competitive with locating in another state.""

"HQ2, the board game no pundit can resist.  

(added:  In Washington, you've got the revolving door between government and private industry.  If you have to worry about regulation, that's a big plus.)

If given only the two choices.
Then I'll say the Washington, D.C. metro area.  It's expensive;  but not NYC expensive.  It will cater to Washington.  Amazon will be their neighbor.  And they're less likely to screw their neighbor/someone they know. (and that goes for all the foreign leaders and dignitaries you get to socialize with on embassy row) From a transport sense it would make most sense to locate the headquarters in Washington, D.C. itself.  So that employees could live anywhere in the metro area, commute into work.  Metro DC already has a working airport,metro, bus, and bike system.  Whereas NYC has a ways to go in that regard.**  I often take buses where I'm the only rider.  So, at least in the suburbs, I don't think the public transportation system will be taxed.  But closer to Washington, it will.  People are packed in like sardines at rush hour.  I personally think where I am, around Reston, would be a nice place for a headquarters.  We already have Microsoft, Oracle, Symantec, Verisign, a space company or two.  It's a place employees who don't want to live in the city would want to live.  But unfortunately, it's on the periphery.  It could mean a long commute for someone traveling from Maryland.  Everyone around the Washington, D.C. has a college degree.  Many have advanced degrees.  Just check out the education level in Arlington, VA.  If the talent exists in Boston, they might not mind coming to the Reston/NoVA area.

** I could be off here.  I'm only going by what I've read of the current state of NYC's transport system.  When I used it, as a very young boy, it was just fine.",0.8952,389
"HQs like this are a burden. They do not positively impact the community it lands in for about a decade. Before that you have to get through the growing pains, housing problems, metro congestion + airport traffic, funding the project through admittances + tax breaks + darling packages. Dropping 50,000 jobs on an area that isn’t starving for those jobs creates a massive burden, the dividends of which the area won’t even start to see for at least a few years.

It's interesting to note most of the comment thread seems to be dominated by speculation about where Amazon will end up. Such speculation seems to have missed Professor Galloway's overriding point--that Amazon's ""window shopping"" is a farcical spectacle full of sycophants who don't realize the outcome is dubious depending on Bezos's intentions, and that the outcome itself is rigged--at least in Galloway's opinion--since the choice may ultimately be based on Bezos's personal preference of what other part of the United States he wants to live in versus based on any real fact-finding research-based methodology of the best place to set up shop.

"San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said he was not surprised about Amazon's decision, especially since Amazon was interested in financial incentives for its HQ2, which San Jose was NOT willing to provide. “We’re very pleased to have Amazon’s Lab 126 in our Downtown and look forward to their future growth in our city,"" Liccardo said in an emailed statement. “While San Jose does not offer larger corporate subsidies, we’ve seen tremendous investment in our city recently, ranging from tech titans like Google and Apple to fast-growing gazelles like Zoom and Xactly.”

If we're looking to cast blame here, how about we start with the people with the guns first? Say what you want about Amazon, at the end of the day they dont actually have the power to take your money by force. They have to go through the states we empower with that force to get anywhere near that.
