"I was 10 the first time I attempted suicide. Not only was I being physically, mentally & sexually abused at home I was bullied at school. There was no escape. The pain was all consuming and it reset itself every day. Kids would call me “fag” and I remember in the 6th grade 3 boys was pushing me and telling me after school they were going to kick my ass for being a fairy. I went to the school ground teacher. I told her they were calling me a fag. She looked at me and asked “are you?” I lied and said no. “Sticks and stones” she replied. Telling me I had to toughen up. Even now I’m very well and from all outward appearances i look normal but those thoughts still haunt me. As I get older the more alone I feel and I realize those kids, my parents were right. No one would ever want to be around me and those who do it’s out of sympathy.",-0.9545,195
"I watched this again, and from what I can see thus far--what is being neglected is the fact that Logan does not need to be educated on suicide as he is here, in order for him to have understood that you don't film a deceased man in front of you. I haven't been clinging onto what he did in Japan as much as I had, as I believe he knows what he did was wrong. The issue I continue to have, is the lies and the PR. He tells Bob Forrest that he had not known anyone who killed themself, and that was the problem : his ignorance. He is not ignorant enough to have gone forward with what he did. He made an excuse for himself. Humility can be a process, but what he is doing here is an attempt to wiggle out of things. Logan, you don't need to know someone who took their life. Trust me, you don't want to belong to that club. All I ask is that you be honest with what you tell us. Thank you.",0.2787,201

"To everyone commenting and posting about Logan:

I have no clue what this dude is like. I don’t watch his content and I am not a huge fan of his but I don’t hate him either. In fact, all I know is he is a famous YouTuber who vlogs everyday and posts crazy pranks and funny vids. But what I do know is we are all judging this guy on some videos he posts and yes, they are real reactions and what not, but I can’t say I know Alex Wasabi because I watch his vlogs. I can only say that I like or dislike the content that the YouTuber decided to make. We can’t call him conceited or judge him because of this video; the video was wrong and should not have been posted nor edited or shared with anyone. But for all we know Logan wasn’t thinking and was in the moment when he posted the junk. We can’t judge him or make assumptions because we have no idea who the dude is. However, he did post the video and that video was unacceptable, we should not defend him for the video because it was completely inappropriate and disrespectful. But we can’t go around calling this guy the “scum of the earth” when we’ve never even met the dude either. All I’m trying to say is that we can’t just assume Logan is good or bad. All we can do is either enjoy the content he makes or ignore his posts. In all reality, if you don’t like it, then unsubscribe and leave the channel. No one is making anyone watch these videos and honestly in the end it doesn’t super matter which one we decide. Logan is going to continue to make videos and people are going to continue to watch, so why whine about it anyway.

To Logan: please start thinking before doing. I’m similar to you; I just do without thinking about the consequences or who I could be hurting or offending.and after I don’t forget about my actions and I continue to think about what I should have done differently. I can not imagine having over 15 million people watching and judging everything I do and all the decisions I make. However, you have tons of fans looking up to you and making you their inspiration. Please use your large platform to influence society in a way that will not only make 2018 the best year of your life, but the best year for many others. Just remember that one choice can have a lasting impact on the rest of your life and the breath you took while reading sentence this was a gift.",0.9373,515
