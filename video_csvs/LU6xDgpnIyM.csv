"""Do you like eating""???????????????  The dude has Santa Claus for a  father!  I mean, that's like asking Pope Francis if he like Jesus or Donald Trump if he likes money! And he talked about that woman at the shopping center! LOL! In all seriousness, I was losing it big time until the ass and eating thing made me laugh.  It was just SO sad when he was integrating the photographs while his father told the story.  I felt so bad for him.  That must have devastated him and broke his heart so bad when his mother said she didn't feel the same way towards him that he felt towards her!",-0.9313,125

I cried so fucking much in this video❤️😭😭,-0.3818,12
"I cried through the whole video.

I miss my dad... I just have no idea wether everything’s better with him gone. That may sound bad but I think about it a lot. If he hadn’t died he would have ended up to continue to cheat on my mom and maybe hurt himself... he’d done it before. Maybe if he would have stayed he would have emotionally hurt my mom more and she would have ended up.... 

Maybe my dad would continue to do drugs and drink and he would have become abusive. Maybe I would have ended up without parents.

This is a worst case scenario but it’s possible. I can’t tell my mom how I feel because it might hurt her.

But he died and now I’m here, living across the country from my old home. Although I met this one girl who I’m crushing on and she likes me back, I am now on antidepressants (although my parents were already considering putting me on them when I was 9) and I was sent into a pretty bad depression. It’s better now even though I still do have my moments.

I know no one will probably end up reading this but it feels good to at least say something.",-0.9933,245

My father was an abusive piece of shit to me when i was only about 4 months old and my sister who was 1 at the time and my mom. So we left and this video made me cry so fucking hard cause i really want a father figure but all i have is my mom (which i am very thankful for) and my mothers stupid fat alcoholic boyfriend who isnt any better than my father. It sucks and i can relate a lot with shane in this video. I just wish i could meet up with my father once again and just talk like normal people. Last time i saw my father was when I was about 9 and he did nothing but yell at my sister and I for leaving which wasnt even our faults. This is lame for me to say but i forgive my father. I never realized he was sick and didn't ever really try to be there but it's okay. I'm much happier with my life without him in it. I love you Shane <3 You're brave as fuck for doing this because I know i would never be able to do the same,0.8878,210

My parents got divorced when I was 13 and I really felt like he just abandoned us and I had to immediately go up so I could help my mom take care of my sister. I always saw him as this hateful lazy drunk who would get all his anger out on us... I know I am still young and I still don't see him as a good person, but maybe as I get older and with the help of thid video, I'll start to understand him... It made me want to try to see from his perspective too... Thank you Shane ❤",0.5232,133
