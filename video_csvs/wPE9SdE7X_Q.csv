"FUN FACT
The Olympic Village is just an excuse for athletes to organize absolute orgies and gangbangs. In Sydney 2000, a building was left early by the team originally occupying it but remained unlocked. Athletes and trainers from a few countries used it as a sex building. In some mornings as many as 25 athletes and trainers exited said building after a long night of sex.

It's also worth noting that (at least according to Xenophon) her brother, Agesilaus II, put her up to it.  Not because he thought highly of her, or wanted her to pursue her dreams, but so he could tell other people 'chariot racing is the dumbest sport ever.

"Where was Mike R?  I was excited to hear he was joining the ranks (I loved the Idea Channel!), but he was the only one who didn't appear, just doing vo for his segment.  As far as the format itself- I hope you're tweaking it still.  I'm glad you're updating and doing new things, but this felt repetitive after a while and was hard to hold interest.  It was too much surface info, not enough depth, and the hosts often didn't feel invested in what they were covering.  I often didn't feel invested in what I was listening to.",0.9215,114
While I do appreciate the idea of changing up Mental Floss videos I feel that this just went a bit overboard. Switching hosts really takes away from the video. What was wrong with just having one person per episode? Also it's probably not a good idea to leave in the host saying that what they are presenting is their least favourite thing.,-0.4599,66
"While I haven't read the Game of Thrones novels, I can only assume there are other common threads that tie the chapters together, leading the reader through the narrative, and making up for the lack of a single protagonist. 

I wasn't trying to say that a novel can never function with changing protagonists. I was just trying to use the common convention of  a single protagonist as a comparison in this case. I was just trying to make a point.",0.0,87

"Why are you hiding the condoms from the kids? They know about the Aspirin and Tylenol that adults use and the intoxicants that we all enjoy so why are condoms too wicked for the little darlings to know of? Ignorance is not bliss, so the earlier in life they learn the better. Especially in a world as sexualized as we have made ours, where younger and younger kids are becoming sexually active and also many are experiencing puberty earlier than previous generations. More hormones in your food anyone? ;-)",0.4852,96

"With a plan of two per month, maybe split each episode into Part 1 and Part 2 and then release weekly.  Each could fit that 5-8 minute format which is more digestible plus it brings people back to see the rest and not have to wait two weeks for content.  I like the new concept, good work!",0.8016,62
"Wow, good job, I really hate the change!
Bit strange changing presenter so much and the woman in the middle was terrible.

"Yes! It might not be explicit, but this is elementary school - young kids. I'm trying to share fun Olympic facts, not get involved in the mess of a situation that would probably happen when an 8 year old raises their hand to ask what condoms are and why they are passing them out, or when a student decides this gives them permission to share with the class all the knowledge they've picked up about sex. It's just not something I'm willing to risk dealing with. 5th grade public school puberty education programs, (typically done in the near the end of the school year,) usually require parent consent, as well they should. I'm not just going to randomly bring it up, even if it's just a small moment.  Anyway, great video Mental Floss! I love the Olympics and really enjoyed it! Just a concern from an educator to keep in mind for future videos, depending on what you want their purpose to be.",0.9882,183

"Yes, but we can also follow those people if we wish to see their content on its own. It would be okay if it was more of an introduction to the other presenters and their own work, but this looks like more of a permanent change. It's become something other than just watching a video with John. Myself and the thousands of subs that were watching before the changes were watching for what it is, something they like and know that they are familiar with. It annoys me that nearly everyone has to up and change these days, what for? If it ain't broke...as the proverb goes.

I'm just not up for it, I had reasons for subbing and staying subbed, but oh well, I'm just 1 viewer. I matter not. Of course, I'll check out future videos to see where they go, and stay subbed, but I will probably only end up watching John's pieces, or stop all together as his pieces will only be part of. But as I said, my opinion isn't really relevant, I just felt obliged to give it. Be it bad or good, data is data.",0.8248,219

i like the new format but it needs some polishing to make it amazing. there are a lot of good pointers in the comments like how the it is a bit to formal while these videos could be a bit more personality driven with jokes. which i know won¬¥t be a problem with these hosts as i¬¥ve seen earlier work for most in which i love them.,0.9647,74
