OK the Halo isn't really beautiful (it's very ugly) BUT if this REALLY protect the drivers, that's cool.
But I don't understand guys who wants to suppress the Halo, it's like ""oh, the sit belt is lla little bit ugly, we must suppress this"", people who say that are fuking asshole who don't know that his favorite driver is a human who have a family and friends and, I hope so, want to live a long time not like the French guy who died in Suzuka in 2014 (I don't remember of his name, I was to young). Don't know what you (who are reading this comment) will say, but the moment the Halo will save someone, I think you will say ""wow, that's incredible""
