"On a recent Interview with Sufjan by The Hollywood Reporter

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sufjan-stevens-interview-oscars-tonya-harding-call-me-by-your-name-1080060
Interviewer : You just released a song about Tonya Harding. And, in a New York Times interview, she got pretty riled about you using her name.

Sufjan : I loved that. I went out and got a physical copy of the newspaper, put it in Saran Wrap and archived it away. That's something I'm going to enjoy showing my grandchildren. She's just tough as nails. It's all so problematic. She's obviously quite possessive of herself and her brand. I loved that story, but I felt the writer was being very generous [to her].

Interviewer : That was one of the last pieces before she started telling reporters they can't ask about her past.

Sufjan : She had her 15 minutes of fame — again! She's complicated. I'm just glad to know that she's fine. She's a survivor, and she's going to be OK. I wish I could write her a letter to let her know I'm not making any money off of the song or capitalizing on anyone. I'm a creative person. I write songs about people, historical people, living or dead, mythological or not. It's my job. My job is to write a song about Tonya Harding or Abraham Lincoln or John Wayne Gacy or Moses or Venus. (Laughs.) It's my job!

Interviewer : A lot of people assume the song is on the I, Tonya soundtrack.

Sufjan : The song is in no way affiliated with the movie, but I certainly rushed to release it in tandem. I sent them a copy while they were still editing: ""Hey, y'all, I know that you're working on the movie. I've been working on this song for about 10 years."" That's true. I've been trying to write a Tonya Harding song for a long time. The musical director got back to us and said, ""Um, we're kind of going in a different direction.""",0.9861,374

The snide remarks were everywhere but she fought her way into the ""club"" anyway and shined. For the mistakes she made, she paid a heavy price and, for the bullies of the world, they will continue to make her pay. Let it go. It was almost 25 years ago, for God's sake.  I wish her well and hope she can, one day, stop having to fight back. At long last.",-0.2302,145
