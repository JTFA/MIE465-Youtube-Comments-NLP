"Ah money. I did 6 years of undergraduate (a double degree - ie 2 bachelors simultaneously) and am now doing a PhD fresh out so I've had a lot of experience with shoestring budgets and side hustles. I think it's getting harder in the age of social media because you're constantly inundated with streams of other people's financial decisions. I'm at an age where people are getting engaged, married and buying houses and I just cannot even begin to fathom how they're affording it (and then remember that for most people this is their 4th-5th year of full time wages). I would say that if anything the lack of money has helped me define who I am more clearly than having lots of money could because everything you do and everything you buy is an investment and you're always considering if you really need something and if it will add value to your life. It's also made me a more sustainable consumer I guess as I only buy things I genuinely need or use and has led to a tendency to invest in good quality pieces",0.8748,198
Aloe gel (like the kind you put on sun burns) is what I use when my skin flakes. I put it over my moisturizer.  Its soothing and moisturizing and its got a little bit of stick to it so when you go with the flakes it sticks them down and makes a kind of barrier over them. It makes them way less noticable when wearing make up .,0.8078,73

"As a second-year uni student, i'm finding it very hard to manage my money. I'm lucky enough to be granted enough to live off without the support of my parents, but even so this is very new to me and budgeting is not my forte. I have savings, so I know I have something to fall back on, but one of my biggest fears is having literally no money and being bankrupt. I'm doing a film course and want to go into the media, so jobs are limited and the feeling of possibly not making enough to live off intensifies.

"Aw money... Well, it's always been an issue for my parents. I'm in a household that has been living off benefits for twelve years now. And while I'm in my first year of uni, most of my mates have gotten jobs/are persuing apprenticeships or have part-time jobs. When it comes to money now, I don't mind talking about it but I am quite cheap. Or I get a lot of anxiety surrounding big amounts of money and being responsible for using it properly (I have the worst impulse control). But it is interesting thinking about money and talking about it, especially as a new woman/adult in a Bengali relatively poor household. For example now that I have means to a regular(ish) income through say a part time job or even my maintenance loan, it's considered (to a very small but weird extent) the family's money rather than my money. While for the most part I can go ham with my money however I please, if things get tight for my parents they rely on me to help them out a lot. Which isn't bad, just interesting to think about in relation to other people and their relationship with money which is often very personal and not as communal as it is for me.",0.8116,241

"I agree with you to an extent but don't think we necessarily spend less on material things. While I think we are more thrifty and a bit more DIY-centric with stuff, I think we live in a very ""treat yo' self"" time where we feel like we need a reward for the smallest things. We also spend soo much on gadgets and electronics, and are constantly updating things because things go ""out-of style"" so quickly. Take fashion for instance, people don't dress simply for the weather anymore. Everything is a statement, so while in the past retailers would only release new styles for each season, they're releasing things almost every week of the year.

"I am a university student from Greece. Money is a weird concept for me! My family has been cutting down on expenses for years now and every year we have less of an income and more expenses, because greek economy is at a horrible place right now for a middle class family. As a student, I am living with my aunt, thus I have no living expenses. Yet uni life is more expensive than you can imagine. I personally need to cover transportation, my phone bills, outdoor activities, doctor's appointments, travelling (if there's any) and aaaaall the kind of fun stuff that you wanna do in your 20s. Plus gifts for friends or family, plus conference fees, plus, plus, plus....

Mostly it's zero. So what do I do..? I get a job, losing hours of sleep and uni classes, getting worried I'll fail to the one thing I am supposed to be excelling! Because I loooove my studies and I wanna do great. Right now I don't have a job, trying to get one. So I am using up my little savings.

The past 10-12 years that I've been working have been really up and down as far as money, and I would not be where I am now without incredibly supportive parents. So, while putting in hard work and long hours and settling for jobs that I don't love because they offer a decent paycheck and insurance (I'm American) have contributed, without the privilege of parents who are able and willing to help, I would be broke and living in a tiny apartment in an unsafe area right now. Not to mention how they paid off my college tuition and car all at once so this is the first loan I've ever had to take out, so I've got better rates because I've been able to maintain good credit.

Now I currently do not earn any money and the only income I have is literally just financial support from my parents. 
My bf and I are also starting to rant a flat in December, which will be paid by him (for me most part) until I earn money again.

Like another commenter said, I constantly worry about spending money but not making any, and also what it's going to be like when I graduate. My friend is 23, he's now doing a Masters but is ¬£54,000 in debt and he had to ¬†move home for two years when he graduated as he couldn't find a job straight out of uni and that's what worries me - how quickly the job market is changing and how difficult it's going to be for someone with an English degree to find a job out of uni. I don't want to have to move back home but I may have to, what with raising house prices and everything as well.

I work in finance and I find a lot of people do not know how to manage their money and I definitely didn't know how to either (and still kind of don't.) My best advice is pay off your highest interest rate debt first (mostly credit card debt) as quickly as possible and then your lowest interest rate debt (student loans would be less than credit cards) and then once you've paid off debt that's when you should save money. BUT it's good to have a small savings stored aside in case of an emergancy,0.7154,103
"I work in theater as a lighting designer and have similar stresses as you. When I design a show, I usually get paid 6-8 weeks after the show closes. So my money arrives in fits and starts. Usually a bunch at once then not for a while even though I'm working consistently. What really helped was getting a second freelance job. I also work as a video editor for a small company (5 employees total). The job has really flexible hours and pays weekly. It really helped alleviate some of the money stresses. Currently I earn 75% of my money working in theater and 25% from editing. The editing job covers my basic expenses (car expenses, internet, phone, ect). Theater covers rent, healthcare, ect.

It took me a while to find this balance. I freelanced full time in theater for 3 years or so before getting the second job. I've been working both jobs for the last 2 years.",-0.228,185
"I'm 20, living overseas, and perpetually broke. Finding a job in my home country (Australia) was quite the challenge and I feel like our economy is breaking down too fast for anyone to be able to afford anything. I was unemployed for a year after leaving school, and when I finally found something, it was ok for the first few months. Things changed and I started looking elsewhere, but I was unable to find work anywhere else. I stayed at that job for a year and a half before deciding to move to China, where the job prospects are more open and the living is more affordable. Even so, I am in a constant state of money worry and having to return to Aus for a month is not helping, as the currency conversion rates have snuck up behind me and clobbered me with a baseball bat. I am the only one in my group of friends who has been able to move out of home, as the real estate prices and job wages are not compatible with normal living. Work should not have to be the only thing we ever do in our lives, but in order to survive out there, I feel like we have no time for anything else. How are we supposed to really live if all our time is taken up with earning money? Something in the system needs to be adjusted. I literally had to move to the other side of the world to be able to live AND work. Why are western countries obsessed with killing their young people using the work force? How do we live?

"Right now im living of my savings and student contribution. I dont want to take a studentloan yet. Its tough though, because I live with a partner who is not really good with saving money or having enough until the end of the month. So basically, I support two people from the 20th every month. I try to save money by spending time at the library reading coursebooks and to buy everyting discount, but it is a real pain to always be worried about money.",-0.7456,93
"Right now, I'm really worried that I have no money saved. I know a lot of people my age (not all of course) have savings from when they were little and me and my family haven't been able to save much for my future plans.

"Since I am a college student and I work on campus jobs, I have long extended times where I don't have any income (my mom pays for my tuition and rent/utilities but if I want to go out - restaurants, bar, movie, etc- I need to make money) because either 1. school's not in session or 2. lack of events. 
For the first time, I have a job where I have consistent hours (I'm an ochem lab TA) where my previous jobs I was working at events as an AV tech. The nice thing about the AV tech job was that most events were either on the weekend and/or in the evenings and were long events (normally would work 4-6 hours/event and most of that work was within the first hour and the last hour for set up and clean up). I would have to compete with other techs for jobs (it was first come, first serve).This job was highly dependent on whether or not there were events on campus, so I had no control over my income.  During a month, I would try to work 3-4 events and have a large sum of money deposited. 
My current job as I said has constant hours. I work 6-8 hours/wk during a set time period. It's nice having constant hours every week, but it's not like I can work one shift and get a large chunk of change. I can predict how much income I will have during a months time though which is nice.",0.8057,293
"Since everyone else is talking about it i thought i would too. Im 19 and have a salary of ¬£18,868 roughly before all the deductions.

Anyway I still live at home so I'm currently saving to be able to buy a house one day and I'm grateful for the position I'm in. I pay my mum rent and have a phone bill to pay but apart from that I get to spend my money on what I want. I send ¬£500 of my just over ¬£1300 a month into an ISA at the beginning of every month and anything left over at the end of the month which is usually ¬£200-¬£300 or can be a bit less sometimes when I end up buying lots of stuff I want, gets saved as well.",0.8338,170

"The only moisturizer suggestion I have is the Vaseline Intensive Care 10x Healing Serum, which comes in both oil-free or with oil and is fairly unscented. However, it isn't cruelty free, which really sucks, but if you're looking for something then maybe compare whatever cruelty free products you can find to that? I accidentally really irritated my skin with a new cleanser about a week and a half ago, like full on deep red rash all over my face, and this moisturizer basically saved my life.  It's been very cold where I am so the rash healed into extreme flakiness all over my face, but this moisturizer has completely healed my face at this point in time. What usually happens to my face every year is that it goes really dry during the winter and doesn't go away, no matter how much of any moisturizer I've used, but I have a feeling this one runs the best chance of finally keeping my face moisturized.

As for money, I'm comfortable talking about it and I want to hear more of how you take care of your money! :)",0.9658,203
