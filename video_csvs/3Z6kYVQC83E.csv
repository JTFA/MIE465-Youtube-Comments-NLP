"James, I'm a high school student living in the U.S. recently our school has really been cracking down on our ""retaliation"" which I have no reason why, we're pretty tame. And they've outlawed senior pranks, and well as ""retaliation"" me and my friend are stockpiling ducks... And I imagine that you know where this is going. Its going to be a slow process as 100 ducks costs about 15$ on Amazon, but im trying to get more people in my graduating class in on it to lower the costs on myself a bit. I'll comment the results if it turns out well around June or so at the end of the year.

The best plan we've came up with so far is during a blizzard go throw them all over the football field to be burried in the white stuff and to be discovered come spring.",0.8422,164
