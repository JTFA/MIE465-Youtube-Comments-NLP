"*Must admit, if just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Azerbaijan (I guess you even don't know where this country is).

If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed.
