"PointlessCamel Good question! Air is made of gases like nitrogen and oxygen. The molecules in the air are small but they exist. You can feel them when either you or the air is moving relative to the other. That's air resistance. Basically, they get in the way of you moving. It takes greater effort to push them out of the way than if they weren't there. Of course, with a more dense liquid, like water, there are more molecules and so the effort you need is even greater. In a perfect vaccuum, there would be absolutely nothing and you could continue to move forward without having to expend more energy. 
An everyday example is the wind. Notice that if you move very quickly against the wind, instead of standing still, the force you feel increases. If your surface area is bigger (like a kite, a sail or a parachute), the force increases too. We make projectiles (e.g., rockets) the shape they are to reduce resistance, amongst other reasons.",0.9678,199

2.  The plane would go too fast and the wings would come off.*
3.  The plane would pull too much g coming out of the dive and the wings would come off.

IIRC that particular pilot was in the lefthand seat, and as yokes in Boeing aircraft (no idea about A300/A310) disconnect when too much physical pressure is placed on them and default to the lefthand yoke, there would be no difference. And the pilot in the righthand seat did realize what was happening, and did indeed press his sidestick's override button (the other pilot also pressed his, hence the crash).",-0.4621,134
