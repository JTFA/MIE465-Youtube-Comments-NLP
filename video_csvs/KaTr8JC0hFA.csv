"2 things: This Tarte dragathon is hilarious,Every Company has their target consumers,are you really surprised at the color range?!
Another thing, in the US whites make up 77% of the population,blacks are about 13%. Do the math maybe? I look at most brands and it’s pretty common (besides MAC and fenty) to only have 3 darker shades.
I’m taking mental notes of EVERY guru on YouTube that are playing into this PC bullshit and “canceling” Tarte. We will see that Tarte PR unboxing in the next few months after ppl forget ✌🏼",0.2835,117

And I know the pop sugar makes it sound like 10 shades to each hydrating and matte but James Charles said 5 for each which would amount to 10. So I hope those 5 shades for each of the foundation types are deep or tarte really lost their mind. Either way the brand needs to get it together!,0.4482,61
"Angie1591 if youtubers, huge product endorsers dont speak up then these companies will keep putting out the same stuff and the same excuses. Its easy to say just don't buy or dont support but when has that honestly stopped these big brands from getting over?

Bottom line is the purpose of creating a product is to maintain the consumers you have and to bring in new consumers idk about y’all but hell I’m trying to make more money so if I have a product that black ppl like then my next launch I’m like how can I improve this product to bring in the white community and Latin community the Asian community that’s more money so why not be exclusive if you’re trying to make profit.

"I feel like they should be dropped from Sephora and ULTA. Then they can see what happens when you continue to be this discriminate like they have been ( this isn't the first time they came out with a shit shade range). Also show other makeup companies that no one will stand for it anymore. I felt like I was back in the 50's with the whole ""all black people look the same"" racists, looking at this piss poor shade range. Last time I checked POC aren't orange or red! Which were the 2 colors they made. I am fair skinned, I never will know what it is like to be a poc, to feel how they feel, to always be getting shunned from so many things in life. For those who say ""who cares it just makeup, or stop complaining "", you have no right to say that. How would you feel if it was the other way around? To go in a store and see 300 shades of one color and maybe 8 that you might be able to pull off. I can go to a store and buy one foundation, while a poc has to buy at least 2 shades just to try and mix to find their shade & spending at least twice as much as me. I 
Will never quite know how it truly feels but I stand with this issue fully and believe EVERYONE needs to talk about it.

I just found your channel and this is my first time watching you and let me just say that this made me so sad. I don’t know much about how you usually are in your videos but you are so clearly disappointed and defeated in this video. It broke my heart and made me angry. Tarte needs to do better. They owe their consumers so much more. They owe people of color so much more.

I can't obviously say I have the exact same issue girls of darker skin have but I'm right there with you. I know what it's like not being able to find a shade in a foundation I'd love to try. 6-10 or even 15 shades just doesn't cut it anymore.

People are worried about the applicator being sanitary.. its the same thing you do with your concealer putting on your face and putting it back in. Its only unsanitary if your using it on someone else just always use on clean skin and it should be fine. But i def wouldnt use it on others face. Btw yesss they need to make more shades they don't even have my undertone and my shade and im a pinky caramel colour.. A MESS!!!!

You weren't shading Tarte, you were professional and I can feel the genuine concern you have with this foundation and how it affects your viewers. I thought you were in luck with Tarte's Shape Tape foundation just because you are on the closer side of ""medium deep/dark"" but even with this foundation you didn't have a shade and that says a lot. That there wasn't much thought displayed when this launch was made and that no one even cared to cater to all shades & undertones. It can be done and we've seen it done with the brands you listed at the end who have a wide variety of foundation suitable for various shades.

"Thank you Shayla for doing this video so eloquently and respectful. I love your videos! Tarte should have known better, I agree. In some cases a lot of these brands seems to be all about the money. I find a lot of these videos that are being made by Caucasian people are apologizing for being white because they are able to find their shade. That is something I will not do, I am what god made me. I use most of the products from the brands that you have mentioned due to the fact that I am a make up artist and I go to brands where shades are exclusive to all skin types. However this is an unforgiving world and at this point Tarte is going to have a hard time redeeming themselves. I hope that going forward certain brands will take a que from this and learn from their mistakes. 2018 is the year of Unity in all aspects!

They will never be able to come back from this it really shows their priority and they need to address the issue.. I am with you 100% Shayla,0.2975,72
This is so sad Shayla. I'm really disappointed in the shade range because I love shape tape concealer. Its like they said fuck us😫,-0.6351,27
This is why I have never bought Tarte's foundation. I already have a very hard time finding my shade and this review shows that i won't be buying their foundation,-0.1761,31
"This is why, everyone knows. I make it known... Shayla is my beauty guru icon. My heart is always for her! I love her 💖",0.8516,30
"This isn’t anything new from tarte, it has ALWAYS been an issue with women of color and their brand. Tarte is just a brand  who markerts their product towards women of fair complexions NO SURPRISE",0.296,39
This launch was so crazy I still couldn't believe it especially after Fenty you would think brands would take that into consideration like we should do that too. Btw love off topic love your lip color what did you use?,0.8309,42
"Those colors are so old school! Its like anyone non-white is just ""dark"". No love, nuance or detail to the beautiful yellow, brown, red or black diaspora at all. This is not accidental in 2018! This is intentional... Especially when WOC are 80% of their money! #BOYCOTT Until they do better... "" NEXT! """,0.8954,68

WHERE'S THE SLAYLA LASH? I need it 😔. Is it ever coming back??,0.0,17
"Well said 👏👏👏 💯 agree with you! They have made my shade but as you said it’s 2018, it’s not ok to make any skin color an afterthought may it be lighter or darker. They should have spend less money in pr trips, iPads and gifts and more money on educating themselves and their team so they wouldn’t talk out of their ass! I’m a Mac nc20, can find my shade in any brand but I feel sooo offended as a human! For me tarte is cancelled too! ❤️😘",-0.899,109

"What's wild is that as a fair white woman I could wear all the way up to shade 11 with a spray tan from the salon. This is infuriating and I'm baffled that they would create a line of foundation that has just three deep shades. Not okay, I'm gonna be passing on this and probably skip the concealer in the future too 🤦🏻‍♀️",0.2263,71
"When a product is due to launch and you realise that the brand is releasing a mere 3 medium deep shades, isn’t it just better to boycott the launch altogether and not review their PR products? It seems to me that brands like tarte only stay relevant because of the hype given to them by influencers whether it’s good or bad. This company isn’t even ashamed of this mess, they were ignorant enough to disable their consumers comments, doesn’t that say something to us? There are alternative brands that cater for darker skin tones all year long not just seasonally so why the heck are we even giving them any air time?",-0.5171,127

Why do you guys make such a big deal about the color. This is not the first brand that doesn’t have all the color range of everyone! You guys make everything a race problem. 🤦🏻‍♀️,-0.4574,44
Wow its great you did this because they collaborated with you as well. What's sad is that I love Tarte. I just think they really screwed up and they should've waited to improve the hydrating formula and added a lot more colors. Do they need to hire somebody better to handle there PR absolutely. These huge companies are in a race to spit out new products every month. A lot of the brands I use to love don't love so much no more because they are more focused on making the money. I've pulled back in buying new launches and I will continue to do so until they hear the message. No more... I will stick to my NC30 and 2.3 from Smashbox. thank you for doing this again.,0.9779,139
"Wow!  I din't even know about all this because I wasn't planning on trying this foundation because I don't really like the concealer.  I know, I am the only one.  But, I am like one of the whitest people on earth and Tan Sand, or whatever, looks almost like I. could wear it.  Seriously?  That's crazy.  I am glad I saw the comments and researched what was going on.  Sad.",-0.6881,83

You don't get it do you. There are hundreds of skin colors and textures and moisture differences. Creating dark foundation is very difficult to do with out making you like mud or a night sky. Unless you are in the makeup industry creating makeup...you can't say shit. Get over it. Your just gonna have to mix and max to find ur perfect shade. If everyone else does...you can do it too. NO TEA NO SHADE!,0.6318,87
"You look beautiful! I adore the shape tape concealer, but i can find a new concealer...i have been disappointed with tarte since the release of the clay play II palette ( using the exact same packaging as the first palette...uugghhh?) now having so many light shades in this foundation and leaving out darker skin tones is just mind blowing. I think I'm over tarte. ....",0.4574,74

u are tho...rather u want it or not. Just like I am not even a thought at all for Iman or opal!!! I just pass by their products and guess what? I don't get mad....at all.
