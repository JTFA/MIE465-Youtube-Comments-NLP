They pimp them out use their image and they have signed a three way deal like Nikki did! Remy old school she keep her masters, royalties etc. BOSS. Most artists get excited about the short term exposure and not long term legacy! That’s the difference from a worker and BOSS! Remy and Kim got grown assets!
