"I like the realism featured in it, so far. It reminds me a bit of Edge of 17. I've never cared much for coming of age based movies, until Edge of 17. This looks like it might be as good. (In my opinion, it was a good movie) Light humor and specifics on the emotions of the characters and those around them. Seems cool to me. I hope those who go to see it, can enjoy it! Those who don't care to, that's cool too. Everyone has their own prefrances. Naturally and chosen. In everything. So, let everyone have and keep their own. Just stay seperated and do your own things. Our lives aren't chained to oneanother for a reason. For many reasons. Take advantage of yours and let others do the same with theirs. As far as we know, the ones we live, are the only ones we've got. All that's relevant, right now. So, focus on living it how you choose and PERFER. That's the point of being born with free will, reguardless of what others try to convence you of doing with your life. The only one whose REALLY in control, is you. So keep that control and remain beautifully human. That's all I've got to say here. Have a great one, reader.",0.9835,255
