I went into it with extremely high hopes, wanting it to be as delicious as everyone said it was, and wanting to catch up on my fast food burger childhood (lol) but it just wasn’t that great to me... the ingredients tasted higher quality than McDonald’s, of course, but the burger patty itself was lacking flavor and texture... it was just plain to me... the fries were disappointing too... and with animal style they just plop a slab of cheese on top of a pile of fries so only some of the fries got a bit of semi-soft cheese... but then I went across the street to Freddy’s steak burger (a less known chain) and the burger was AMAZING. The patty itself was so flavorful, with a slightly crispy outside and a moist and juicy inside. All the other components were delicious yet still supported the meat as the star. I go there once a week now. The fries kinda suck lol but the burgers and dogs are fucking delicious. When it comes to fries my favorites are McDonald’s or the ones I make at home!",0.9902,256
