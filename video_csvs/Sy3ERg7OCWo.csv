"Stray Kids is a group created by Bang Chan who is a JYP trainee (and the leader in Stray Kids)...he wanted to make his own music, and started making it with Jisung (Han) and ChangBin and that's how 3RACHA was created...so those 3 became producers at a young age. 3RACHA began adding more friends to their group and made a 9 member group. Through a survival show (between the company's upcoming female group vs Chan's male group), JYP decided that he will let debut Chan's group and let them make their own music as they has always done. Many songs (included this one) were made by them through the show. Please listen to 3RACHA's MIXTAPE and Stray Kids' MIXTAPE. All are pre-debut songs because they will officially debut in March 26th.",0.7713,154
