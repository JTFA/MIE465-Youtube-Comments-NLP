"I purchased the 50GB for $1 option on iCloud to do a full backup on my old iPhone 5s to transfer it all to my new iPhone 6 Plus. Now that I don't need the iPhone 5s anymore and have transfer all data required I need to delete the iCloud storage on it. When I try to do so it says ""Cannot Delete Backup"". This is very frustrating, I have tried doing a full reset on the 5s and it still can not be deleted. Is there anything else that I can do?

Also is there a way to disable iCloud entirety? It has cause me much trouble for the past following year. 5GB isn't enough to do back ups even, so I buy the 50GB plan and even then other problems like not being able to delete backups is the tipping point.

TL:DR - Transfer all data from 5s to 6Plus, using iCloud. Now iCloud doesn't allow to delete old backup, how to fix? Anyway to disable and delete iCloud entirely? I also purchased the 50gb plan!

I'm posing this here because I have ran into another problem...""You are not allowed to create or update this content"". Problems after problems with apple products... Name a more iconic duo.",-0.9352,237
