"Can I just to say to everyone here shaming Mirren for being a Zionist - people - the existence of the state of Israel is not going anywhere. I hate that we are in such divisive political times that definitions of words change and then everyone must conform to new definition. There is a MAJOR difference between simply supporting the right to a Jewish state (my definition of Zionism) vs. BLINDLY supporting every act of the Israeli government and that Israel could do no wrong. I am Jewish, I believe Israel has a right to exist. I also support two state solution, bc there is no other viable alternative that would work. There just isn’t. Stop being sad that Mirren supports Israel’s right to exist. Get over it. Most people do. And let me also add that it is OKAY to condemn any act of the Israeli government - this does NOT mean you’re anti-Semitic. Criticizing Trump or Clinton doesn’t mean you’re anti-American.

"I understand they tell us that we have GPS because of satellites, but if there are so many satellites up there in ""space"" then how come we never see or hear about any of them crashing? and if there are really satellites up there then why do we need all these towers? I know they use the towers on the ground to do the GPS. There are lots more questions that can be asked. How come all the images NASA and other space agencies show us are CGI(Computer Generated Images)? and How come after all these years we don't have a real image of the ""globe"". There is such a thing as true science and fake science. It is also possible to lie with mathematical equations. Lets look at this simple problem in basic algebra, if we have a half a cup of water, we can say that it is half empty and half full. Let's say E is for empty and F is for Full. 0.5 E = 0.5 F, that is a true statement in math and in real life, but what happens when we multiply that by the number 2? In math we validate the correctness of an equation by multiplying both sides by a number. So then if we multiply both sides by 2 we should have the answer. 2 * 0.5 E = 2 * 0.5 F this in math is a correct result, but in real life, an empty cup doesn't equal a full cup of water. This goes to show that Einstein could conjure up a equation that in mathematics and imagine it is true, but when we look at it in real life it doesn't make sense. Please do some research, here's a link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOGa8OQzjQ4&index=9&list=PLYI8318YYdkCsZ7dsYV01n6TZhXA6Wf9i Please watch the other videos in the playlist too. There are so much more question we could ask, it's just a matter of doing research to answer them! If there is such a thing as gravity then why is it picky what should float and what should stick to the ground? Why does a helium balloon float and an apple falls to the ground? If the earth were really a globe then there would be a curvature we could measure in real life and if it were a globe then a person at the north pole would weight less than a person standing at the equator. If you throw a wet tennis ball why does the water traverse to the center and fly off of the tennis ball and not on the spinning globe? If we were spinning then why don't we feel dizzy all the time? check out these other videos! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeIGrEtPMmE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARp2j8t3O8Q",0.4131,487
