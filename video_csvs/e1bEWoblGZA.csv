"I'm thinking this has a thought-out meaning, like every bill Wurtz's videos. This time we may find a critical video. I'll explain. 

It's criticism against youtubers who just offer expectation (like unboxing videos) and junk content to their viewers, uploading the first idea that comes to their mind, without thinking about it so much. Once the unboxing is completed the box is empty (there are no more ideas nor content to offer), until another box is found and expectation is provoked again.",-0.7783,95

"See, the truth about the last box is a bit more complex yet easy to grasp. See, it says do not open, but our hero wonders what if. So, we can assume that the hero did in fact open the box.

"Theory: he's one of those people that ghostwrites music for popular artists. he has a fuckton of musical instruments and his command of music theory, composition, and tropes of popular music (not to mention proficiency on a whole lot of instruments) all suggest that he's a professional musician who composes pop music, but nobody knows who he is, so his music must be performed by somebody else. He doesn't monetize his content, so he has an income outside of youtube. plausible ideas: massive inheritance/outrageously wealthy family, active ghostwriter, or he has a desk job. I think that it's most likely that he's an active ghostwriter because of his obvious level of education in music--very few people achieve his skill level as hobbyists. He had a bad breakup a while back (his longer songs make frequent references to missing a significant other, though admittedly that is also just another trope of pop music) and he sees the world in a Camus-esque absurdist perspective, giving his music its bittersweet themes and complete disregard for what's ""normal"" on youtube. He seems like a pretty instrospective guy.",0.9366,209
