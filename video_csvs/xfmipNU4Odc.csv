"I gave one pup from my dog's litter to an ex-friend, awhile later when I asked how the pup was she told me it was hit by a car and died. The next time my dog had puppies, I gave her two. Awhile later I asked how the pups were doing and she told me they got sick and died. She said there was no money for a vet. I was sad but reminded myself never to give her animals again. A year later, her brother friends me on facebook. We talk and we end up talking about the dogs I gave them. 

The first dog didn't die. It ran away. My friend told the person who found it to keep it and that's what they did. The two pups didnt get sick and die, they were sold. Her brother's friend bought one and he showed me a picture the pup and new owner. I confronted the ex-friend and she told me she didnt want to split the money she made then blocked me. 

Her bro told me how angry she was at him and apologizes on her behalf. This is why you friend the brother on facebook. Catch them lies.",0.6762,221

"THIS among others, shows you that you Must give your dog a microchip! Do not get a dog (or other pet) if you cannot afford to feed it and take it to the vet, and, of course, buy toys and treats sometimes! Also, get any dog Outside! Whether it's a walk or run with you, or to a dog park, or just a drive in the car! You may be a ""couch potato"" but that doesn't mean that you should punish your dog because of being lazy or ""too tired"". Really, do not not not get a pet unless you (and anyone around you) can treat them with much respect and love. Oh, and, whenever applicable, please spay or neuter pets. There are waaay too many animals at shelters, dog pounds and rescue organizations. Give the Love and Get the Love!",0.9831,170
