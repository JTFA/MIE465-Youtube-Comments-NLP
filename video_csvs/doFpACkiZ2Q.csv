Although similar I wondered if the effects on peoples ability to comply would alter with different settings. I conjectured that someone going on to jump of a tall building or pushing another off a tall building under the same sort of pressure as with this show, may not have the same result if the setting was a natural height such as a cliff. Man made heights as opposed to 'naturally' occurring heights may have a very different effect on a person's susceptibility and compliance, even a reverse effect.",0.8836,132

Besides that, what's the difference between this and a Sting Operation to catch a pedophile for example? In the Sting there is no victim in that its an actor luring a potential pedo to commit a crime which results in the pedo being convicted.

Today is four years from my motor cycle accident in the black wall tunnel 27 February 2014 when my motorcycle when under a crane and crushed me. I watched one of your shows in the hospital when I was on fentyal and you spoke to me through the TV with the power of suggestion and I thought I was able to get up from my bed yet both legs were in atrophy and both legs bandaged and 75 percent of my left leg hip and left buttock was ripped off and your power of suggestion spoke thought the TV saying my injury was just piss and vinegar and to stand up and walk and all will be well. I even convinced one of the nurses to give me scissors so I could cut my bandages off. Lucky the head nurse stopped me before cutting all my bandages off and standing up and I would of seriously injured myself. But it shows you how powerful the power of suggestion is.
I'm still bed bound and waiting on surgery number 12 spinal surgery.

"You can't in honesty and respect call something that's 99% or whatever the same Derren Brown film as Channel 4's Pushed to the Edge a Netflix 'Original' as they're doing now on Netflix itself, at least in the UK. Shame! Everything Derren has done for years now has disappointed me in some way. A laissez-faire arrogance of his work, taking the viewer/audience as an easily flattered fool already groomed in to his easy going charm alternated with serious face confidence, in recent years might partly explain it.",0.2177,101
"You should try to convince them you kidnapped one of there children and murdered there spouse as well, maybe get them to castrate them self in exchange for a puppy's life. That would be a real riot!
