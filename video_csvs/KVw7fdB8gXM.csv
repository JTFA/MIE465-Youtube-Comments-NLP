"""I dreamed about you again last night,
You never look the same way twice.
I always know it's you,
You're always looking better than you really do.""
- The Heart Remains a Child

Some of the best lyrics of the 90 from EBTG, no doubt about it. In a class by themselves. Dunno if she wrote these, or if Ben did.",0.5267,72
"'Eden', 'Love Not Money'... when I was a wee lad, Tracey's lyrics were the ONLY access I had to thoughts that contradicted the patriarchal norm. Music doing its job in changing the way we view our world - ever grateful for that and delighted to hear that Tracey is continuing the good work.",0.9022,62
"*Don‚Äôt be afraid of live stages, Queen. You‚Äôre adored and we will make it warm and caring for when you return. Sold-out gigs for sure. Tracey Thorn, my english bird, you are UK‚Äôs musical treasure, love.*",0.886,52

"But there are some shots of her looking in the rear-view mirror, just like on the cover she looks at the one in her hand. And I kinda think he may be represented by that guitar she's playing. Also, there's that couple walking down the street with their kids. ¬†
I don't know... Maybe I'm reading too much into it. I'm just so happy this happened. 
The fact that Ewan Pearson produced it makes me sooo happy and Shura being on the Record, even more!",0.9537,94

"EBTG and Tracey Thorn have been my favorite for years and years.  I follow her Twitter, read her book, read her blog.  She and EBTG are my all-time favorite.  This is just my view and I really hate to say it, but the heavy beat and electronic base does not fit with her voice.  Compare this to her Kate Bush cover of Under the Ivy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ucMRm5mtWg.   I realize that musicians change over time, but Ben Watts change to Buzzin Fly may have been good for him but not for her.",0.3996,101

"Her voice sounds richer now and as good as ever, but I'm not crazy about the over produced song. I prefer when Tracey's voice is center stage. At times it sounds like her voice is more of a background vocal.",0.8383,44

"Here I go again
Down that road again
I haven't solved it yet
What happened if we never met
If I'd just ignored
Those sliding doors
If I'd turned instead from your bed?

Am I Queen?
Or something else I might have been?
A star?
Backseat of a blacked out car
Is that me? Or someone else entirely?

And do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Or am I still waiting?

In the midst of sleep
Pictures come to me
Memories and Dreams
Things lost that might have been
If you'd broke my heart
Very near the start
Do I sink alone like a stone?

Am I Queen?
A Majesterial has been
I'm on fire
A head full of desire
This is me
I'm someone else entirely

And do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Or am I still waiting?
Or am I still waiting?

Am I Queen?
Or something else I might have been?
A star?
Propping up the backstage bar
Is that me? Or someone else entirely?

And do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Or am I still waiting?
Or am I still waiting?

Am I Queen?
Or something else I might have been?
A star?
Backseat of a blacked out car
