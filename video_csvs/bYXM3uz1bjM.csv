"*LYRICS*
Chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions in my ways
I've come to take as law
Always you [?]
Always you [?]

[Chorus]
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards

[Bridge]
How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?

[Verse 2]
Chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions I've come to take as law
Always Pakistan and Netherlands

[Chorus]
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards",-0.9646,165

I need more songs similar to this,0.0,7
"I think it sounds like he's trying to convey what it feels like to stumble through life while others around you seem to be moving on to bigger and better things. It can be depressing and discouraging and can make you feel like a failure, but if all you ever do is compare yourself to others you will never truly be happy. He even ""stumbles"" through the song, taking twice as long as normal to get the lyrics out. He's delayed, literally and figuratively.",-0.8464,93
I want more,0.0772,3
I wonder how many babies were made because of James Blake's music,0.0,12
I wonder if this song was inspired by the motion illusion you experience when you've come to a full stop at a red light but both the cars on either side of you keep pulling slightly past so your eyes tell you your moving forward while your inner ear tells you you're staying still... Love it,0.8074,57

"If you guys like music that is new and different I just found this new artist that just released a song for his first album it's really  interesting, I don't even know what genre to  call it. What do you think? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS168Mxps3s&t=3s",0.7053,45

"Lyrics: 

Chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions in my ways
I've come to take as law
All that I ask, you be on the other side
All that I ask, you be on the other side

If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no, you're going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no, you're going backwards

How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?

How can you sleep, baby, there's no good way?
How can you sleep?

More chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions I have come to take as law
Oh there's Pakistan and Netherlands

If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no
You you're going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no
You you're going backwards",-0.8961,197
