Is Coming to America a *superhero* movie?

Thought so.

Does Blade Trilogy (a superhero/anti-hero, whatever) have a *predominantly black (and African-descent) cast* ?
Thought so.

Well, there you go. Those are the differences.
Now, I haven't read the reviews that say BP is the first black superhero movie (which is absolutely mistaken), but I'm just going to try to be positive here. I mean, you know how it is these days, clickbait everywhere. Maybe , in the article, they just mean that BP is *the first black superhero movie in the MCU* . If not, then they should be ashamed of themselves for not doing enough research.
