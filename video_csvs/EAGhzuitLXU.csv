Great songs rise to excellence when they touch many souls. It doesn't matter WHY the song was written. Sometimes they mean more to us when the writer explains why - but ... after all.  each soul is touched differently. Just accept the music resonating into your soul - or don't - only you know.,0.8158,59

"Lyrics


I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill 
Threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that’s been loved

Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me don’t you cry when you’re down
But mum there’s a tear every time that I blink

Oh I’m in pieces it’s tearing me up but I know 
A heart that’s broke is a heart that’s been loved

So I’ll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you’d be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back 
He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up  
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case 
John said he’d drive, then put his hand on my cheek 
And wiped a tear from the side of my face 

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that’s been lived
So I’ll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you’d be there holding me up 
Spread your wings as you go, when God takes you back 
He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home

Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person that I have become
Spread your wings and I know 
That when God took you back, he said Hallelujah you’re home",0.997,319
