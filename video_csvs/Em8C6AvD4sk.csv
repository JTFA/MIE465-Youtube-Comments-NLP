....personally....the solution is simple.....all news choppers must remain 2000 feet behind the chase scene and at 2000 feet above the ground.....the police helicopter should always be in track mode.....police cars should be on adjacent streets ready to move in when ( A ) the driver bails out or ( B ) the driver gets out and walks into his house apartment or whatever and finally ( C ) in extreme cases ....the chopper is given the authority to open fire.....with laser targeting systems and 20mm twin cannons it wont take long to bring any vehicle to a stop...and all becausae instead of stopping you decided to run....over a minor infraction like a turn signal failure...so grow up america....pull over,0.7184,139

"In my smallish city here in North Carolina we had a pursuit recently end very horribly. The Car being chased ran a red light going over a hundred miles an hour and slammed into a car with two women in it and killed both of them. This wasn't televised, and the crime the person was being pursued for was a nonviolent crime. What's worse is that the suspect in the car being chased ended up being innocent of the crime they were being pursued for, so this chase happened based on just incorrect suspicion. The police are not blameless here. When a situation escalates to a car rocketing down a busy street at a hundred miles an hour you need to asses the risks and rewards of continuing this chase. If it's a nonviolent offense, and you're not even sure the person you're pursuing is even guilty, it is not worth putting civilian lives at risk by prolonging a pursuit that has escalated to dangerous speeds",-0.9876,176
