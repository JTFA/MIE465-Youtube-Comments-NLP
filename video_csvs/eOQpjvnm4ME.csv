"+Srithor And don't overlook the fact that keeping Franken on the hill means that a sexual harasser/predator has gotten away with it, and suffered no consequences for his actions.

By the way, she accepted Franken's apology under an immense amount of media pressure and public backlash against her. Be real now, do you REALLY think she had any choice BUT to publicly accept his apology after it was pointed out to her that Franken would probably lose his seat if she didn't?

Keeping Franken means that you, yourself, are perfectly ok with there being some level and amount of sexual harassment in the world.

"+Srithor Ok, so you're trying to use your ""he has a strong healthy childish side without malicious intent"" argument to explain away the photo...

Are you really going to look then us in the eye and try and use that exact same argument to explain away the forced french kiss she most definitely didn't want, that she point blank said to Franken before he did it, in very clear, strong language she didn't want it, and he went ahead and did it anyways? That's passing from being 'mere' sexual harassment to sexual ASSAULT.

For perspective, RAPE is also sexual assault.

You can try to whitewash the photo, (even though we won't let you) but you can't whitewash all the rest of it. Franken needs to go.

So you're perfectly willing to let women be victims of sexual harassment, and let the harassers get away with it scot free because keeping Franken in government ""is the important thing""? Really?

"Good piece, but not accurate. Looking at this video, you'd think that sexual harassment is simply bipartisan.  But Colbert ignored the most important point -- the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of sexual harassment is done by left wing luminaries.   Hollywood and the entertainment industry is liberal, and they are falling like ten pins to sexual harassment charges.  Indeed, this lopsidedly liberal misbehavior is still the story that the MSM doesn't want to report -- or quantify.

Yes, there ARE Republican/conservative miscreants.  But the RATIO is what the press won't report.  The MSM will obsess over one Republican in headlines, but won't make an objective comparison of FREQUENCY between the two camps.

A perfect laboratory sample can be found in the California state capitol.  There politicians are all under the same rules, and indeed under the same roof.  In CA, over 140 women have come forward to accuse California state legislators and senior staffers of sexual harassment.  While the Dems hold a 2-1 advantage in the Sacramento capitol, over 97% of the claims are against Democrats.  NO ONE is reporting this ratio.",-0.9299,206

While attempting to debunk a charge of fraud [8:11], Colbert actually DEMONSTRATES the fraud by displaying the fact that his circuit court signature (at the time he signed Nelson's divorce decree) was, in fact, NOT signed by him but by his Legal Assistant Delver Adams (D.A.) [as a trained Paralegal, I know this from experience to be a common practice). The forger is stupid enough to actually copy Adams' initials into the alleged signature (of course, this doesn't prove that Moore, devious guy!, didn't bring his Legal Assistant with him and INSTRUCT her to sign the yearbook; Gadzooks! An accomplice!!); stunning goof. Moore was, in fact, NOT a 'DA' at the time, but a Deputy DA, or DDA. The initials can be nothing other than evidence of fraud from an ignorant forger.

Oh, and yes, even if a woman _is_ showing her tits, that doesn't give anyone else the right to grab them. Her body actually belongs to her and she gets to have final say. Likewise, no-one has a right to grab a man's inner thighs even if he's wearing jogging shorts, agreed? And in your head, you weren't thinking that the man was jogging in the hopes that his exposed legs would be an irresistible come-on to everyone he met - he was just hoping to go jogging without overheating.",0.782,180
