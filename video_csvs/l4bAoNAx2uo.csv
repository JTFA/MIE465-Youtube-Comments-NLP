"Not only Europeans, but on the other side of the Americas as well. I'm from Brazil, and these are my reactions to this video, relating to the region of Brazil where I live:

- Tipping: it is theoretically optional, but in some places it is already calculated in your bill. You should ask for removing it from there if you notice it, or in case you are taking it away, it won't be added by default. Here we call it a ""service fee"" and it is kinda official. Usually it doesn't go directly to the person, but it is then divided between all employees.
- A guy serving you your drink all the time: that is really annoying. Just give me the bottle and let me serve myself. I do have both hands functioning.
- Food portion sizes: in Brazil we have a different method of serving food, being in my region even more special. Most restaurants adopt the ""all you can eat buffet"", in which you take a plate, fit everything you can on the top of it and weigh it to know how much you will pay for it. 500g of shrimps would cost the same as 500g of lettuce in a buffet like this, but don't worry, the price already balances this in the long run. In my region of Brazil, though, we have a limit to the price, in which if you reach the limit price, you can serve yourself as much as you want later on and the price won't get higher.
- Breakfast: in Brazil we usually just have a cup of coffee with milk with a ham and cheese sandwich or something somewhat lighter like that. Maybe marmalade. Honey sounds too fancy and bacon with eggs sounds like you will arrive late at work.
- Friendly staff: selling point. But it gets annoying sometimes when the shopkeeper keeps stalking you asking if you need something. We have both sides of this coin here.
- Buying alcohol/cigarettes: back in the time when I was 15 (15 years ago), people would only care about the profit, so no worries buying it. Now it is much different, but still, they would only ask for an ID if you don't have a beard (yes, that is more of a problem for women)
- Credit/Debit Card for everything: welcome to Brazil. Also, we have the all mighty boleto (Google/Wikipedia it) and dividing the price in fractions to be paid during the course of several months for anything, really. You can buy a ¬£50 item and pay ¬£10 through the course of 5 months if you wish so.
- TV is _sheet_ everywhere, but TV in the USA is really weird. The weirdest thing in Brazil is the amount of ""Christian"" TVs. I really can't understand how are they still being aired even after broadcasting all their lies on TV. Remember that story about false prophets? It's started, man! And started in Brazil!
- 24/7 venues: in Brazil, that is more or less restricted to pharmacies, McDonald's and prostitutes with some exceptions
- Patriotism: I've got the impression Brazilians are way too self-aware to be patriotic 'Murika level. In Brazil, for instance, it is prohibited to use the national flag as a piece of clothing. In the USA, you could buy star spangled pants, which in my opinion is a huge disrespect.
- Guns: believe-me, half of Brazil would love to have the right to own firearms and have the right to wear them on the go, but here, it is almost impossible, unless you are a police officer or a gangster. BTW, gangsters have better guns than the police. Rio saw kind of a treaty with gangs for making the games possible.
- Roads: Brazil is also huge, so we relate",0.9825,737

I consider such unwarranted intimacies as sexual molestation, not different from groping. It is just gross and offensive.
3) modesty. If it is not for public use, don't show it or discuss it! This is equally true of your breasts, penis, car or salary.
4) patriotism is sick by any definition. You do not show pride for the achievement of your ancestors or your military, unless you personally took part in the Apollo program or the invasion of Iraq. ( On the other hand, thanking the homeless vet for all he has done while giving him the change is good ). Never forget that pride is a mortal sin.
