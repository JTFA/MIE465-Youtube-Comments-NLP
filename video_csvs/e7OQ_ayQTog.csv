"First they take the dinglebop, then smooth it out with a bunch of shleem. The shleem is then repurposed for later batches.They take the dinglebop and push it through the grumbo. Where the fleeb is then rubbed against it. Its important that the fleeb is rubbed, because the fleeb has all the fleeb juice. Then a shlammie shows up and he rubs it and spits on it. They cut the fleeb. There are several hizzards in the way. The blamfs run against the trumbles and the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular old plumbus",-0.0772,110
