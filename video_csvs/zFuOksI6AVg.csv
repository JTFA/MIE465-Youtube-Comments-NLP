"""The Shape of Water"" was amazing and probably of my top 7 best favorite films of 2017. It was a romantic fantasy film about a muted woman who worked at the secret facility and she discovers a mutated fish creature who was brutally beaten by the government so she wanted him to be released and share chemistry for their attention. I actually enjoy the visuals and the set pieces were beautifully made and designs and artwork by Del Toro was nicely crafted and he probably made a gorgeous film that it is more like a ""Beauty and the Beast"" storytelling with some dark moments, intense, and mystery. Pretty how he has done for his films like the original classic, ""Pan's Labyrinth."" The performances were so so good including Hawkins done a terrific job as a muted woman with sign language and reacts to her emotions between the monster and life. Jenkins has done a good job, Spencer as always the best supporting lady ever, Shannon as a meaningful bad guy, and the rest were good and yes Doug Jones in it was great as a fish monster. It may not be the best because they think it is weird for a woman who gets sexual attention with the monster, but I don't think it's not bad and it could be cute sometimes. Overall, love it and giving it 10/10.

""The Shape of Water"" was nominated 13 Academy Awards including Best Picture.",0.9947,266

"Chinedu Opara 

Nope I'm the biggest star wars fan, love basically everything about the franchise. 

This particular movie just didn't (in my mind)  convey all that well that it was so similar to humans, the aliens in star wars or star trek that had any romance with a human, were very similar to being human.

On top of that in those franchises, relations between a human and alien aren't essential plot points. The relationship in The Shape of Water is the whole point of the movie.

It isn't a ""narrow-minded"" point of view to think that the relationship in this movie was a bit off putting. 

What is narrow minded is someone making an excuse for someone else's opinion just because it doesn't match your own.

I'm ok if people liked the relationship, I didn't, I felt like it was a bit too off, and since the relationship was a major crux of the movie I didn't completely love the movie.",0.9215,179

How ever, in the movie district 9 when Wikus supposedly had sex with the prawn it was sick, so I don't see much different in that than in TSOW.   But again, I am not here to compare we both have a different opinion but doesn't give you the right to dispute mine because you believe what you read.  I believe Disney pays off reviewers along with other companies.  How do you know this you ask.  Well, I watch a you tube video of entertainment tonight or e I forget of a pretty popular reviewer raving about the film tlj before it came out, then it did come and about a week later he dogged on it bad.

The actress is great but the design of the creature makes it difficult for the audience to really relate to it  (face without much expressions).

There's just a clever but clich√© story that leads exactly where it's supposed to be.

It didn't redeem ""groups"" it demeaned them.

I grew up on the oldies, King Kong, Creature from the Black Lagoon and a host of other sci-fi, horror movies in which some misunderstood woman makes a connection with some sort of misunderstood creature. And... they all did it much better than this turd in a bucket. The story, the dialog and the way in which it was edited and presented was a total failure. I felt no tension. Every political, ethical, moral and sexual cliche was just thrown out there with no context, just flung onto the screen like buckets of paint. But all those visual buckets of paint still couldn't distract me from just how bad the story was.",-0.8863,130

"Honestly, having seen this film recently and trying to go in with as much of an open mind as possible, I really don't understand the massive amount of praise it's been getting. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, but I was personally quite disappointed, and I feel like in this case Chris, you may be reading too much into it as a result of being caught up in the Oscar hype train (though I could be wrong. Opinions are opinions). There were plot threads in this film that popped up for a bit but never went anywhere (like Giles's sexuality, Strickland's family and Zelda's strained relationship with her husband), and so much was never explained. The creature's powers were so convenient and could just be whatever they needed to be for the plot. The relationship between Elisa and the creature was rushed. As others have said, the sexual explicitness was over the top, unnecessary and cartoonish. Compare this film to the Peter Jackson King Kong, another tale about a lonely woman bonding with a misunderstood monster. They created such a developed, compelling bond without needing to ram the sexual aspect down our throats. This film felt like artsy, lazy Oscar bait IMO.",0.2832,232
"I can see why people would like the movie but personally I found it quite boring and to be frank, disgusting. Before I go on I should say I didn't see the last 20 minutes or so(  stopped watching some time after the sex scene ) but I doubt it would have changed my mind. 

 So what did I find disgusting? For one thing, the creature wasn't showing human level intelligence. Sure it was smart and thinking but it did seem more to be like a cross between say a man and a gorilla or whatever. I actually felt repulsed by her having sex with it. Guess much the same revulsion I would feel at the idea of a woman having sex with an animal. 
 
 It's not just an intelligence thing either. On an instinctual primal level imo it's natural to feel repulsed by humans having sex with non human things.

"I honestly enjoyed this movie a lot, I'm surprised so many people had a problem with it. It's refreshing to see something even remotely original these days, I preferred the romance in this movie over the vast majority of romance movies these days. Also, the message this movie conveyed was really deep, what with the humanoid creature, the black community being oppressed, Eliza being mute and not fitting in,...it worked really well in my opinion. And the acting was absolutely brilliant. 
It seems that the romantic relationship between Eliza and the humanoid creature is what put a lot of people off, all I can say is the people turned off by that are pretty damn closed-minded. I never saw this kind of uproar from people watching star wars and star trek, seeing humans in sexual relationships with humanoid beings. Black people used to be seen as animals by the western world, you could say that closed-minded people back then considered it bestiality for a white man/woman to have a sexual relationship with a black man/woman. (The black people being treated unfairly in that time fit in really well with everything).

And i think that once you get it its not so weird anymore. 

I agree that some will probably be weirded out by some scenes or even just find it funny but if you manage to understand the relationship i think the wierdness of it goes away.

That is how our movies are these days, I can not remember an excellent movie in a while.  Actually, I really liked get out and I tonya and 3 billboards.  This movie was far from those movies.

This would have been better if it was in a Star Trek world. It would have been better if they just either made it a sexual film through and through crude and to the bone or just made it a family friendly save the ""thing"" kind of movie. It is sci-fi love story but not a good one, in my opinion. Today's movies just suck in general. TV shows and movies just try to throw to much into these presentations that just make them chaotic at best. Or they just overthrow us with action that just makes liking them for special effects alone and that just make watching them a second time of no interest. Anyway, I am getting off track.

I didn't get the male roommate side story with the coffee shop guy, it was in no way essential to the film. And as Chris says the characters unfulfilled? Isn't literally every story about the unfulfillment and the longing for something more of the characters? Luke Skywalker in Star Wars The New Hope, Harmonica in Once Upon A Time In America, T.E.
