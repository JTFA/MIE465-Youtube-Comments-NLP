"As we all know, A-shit Pie got the (beginning of the) end of net neutrality accomplished, today. As Americans, here are some things to know:
This will not take effect immediately. We can STILL beat this slimy corporate song and dance routine, like we did in 2015.  Call your elected representatives, all of them, and complain succinctly yet forcefully. Keep it short and to the point, people! IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE IN THEIR PARTY OR NOT, YOU ARE A CONSTITUENT.  Please don't use vulgar language, they tend to throw those ""calls"" away, or simply not count them. 

Don't think that by throwing a fit on twitter you are accomplishing much. Call your representatives. A quick google search will give you the phone numbers.  
Multiple Repubs have spoken out against Pie and his shenanigans in the past few days (why the heck did they wait so long!), the dems have opposed it forever, in unison. If enough people speak out about this the Repubs, who are in dire poo because of Trump, will start applying pressure, along with the dems. 

You can also call the FCC, but last I heard (2 hours ago) their phones and internet have been swamped and are down. Also, Anonymous is planning some huge cyber attacks on FCC, Verizon, ATT, all the assholes.

Because between forever and 2015 there was no govt regulation of the internet and things were so bad we needed to invite the govt in to regulate and censor the internet.  Yes because once the govt starts regulating you can be sure they will start censoring the same way they censor TV and radio.  You people are so damned stupid.  Anything that the govt touches dies of cancer.  Yes because capitalism has always been such a failure.  Yes because companies don't give the customers what they want that won't happen. No let's invite in the govt regulators to save the day.  But what if the ISPs start behaving badly the govt won't be able to step in and regulate the internet?  Oh wait yes they will so add to the inherent idea that capitalist companies give customers what they want the always there risk of govt regulation will also keep ISP's from misbehaving.  It worked up until 2015 yet Obama felt the need for a power grab.  Why?  Why are Google and Facebook in favor of govt imposed regulation?  It must benefit them in someway?,-0.9171,198

"I don't think people know what Net Neutrality is. Net Neutrality is to limit certain companies. Like for example: ""Some companies like Google, Yahoo,  Facebook or any other company are streaming different chords at the same time.  What happens when they stream different chords at the same time? They can only stream in one chord, and that one company streaming that chord is one company. That one company can also have bigger content that is totally expensive. Which would effect certain prices. Like buying something on Amazon online for a wrench,  but they don't have  wrenches. The bigger company is going to have a lot more content for a certain item you need.  That certain Item would be like 45$99c as the average price for that certain item, but it isn't the price you would want for that wrench. That's why we need ""Net Neutrality"" because it makes the internet neutral. People over-exaggerate too much.",0.9464,178
"I had a theory of how this might be affecting schools. We all know school is a very important thing correct? Tasks and homework is hard for everyone, which is why we use the internet for help with our work. Now with net neutrality gone, students will have to pay an additional $5 dollars, which they won't do. Schools will have to pay monthly for each computer (or even worse each student) for every month. There are hundreds of computers per school and thousands per district. They're not going to reduce a teachers pay so they're going to take it out from the taxes they recieve so that means less school supplies, poor kids won't be able to get support from school districts for supplies. School districts will be in an outrage and you know what that means, more support from school districts, which I hope would influence the FCC.",0.0661,167

"With Net neutrality in place, the standards of bandwidth are all equal, but at a high level that only the big companies can afford to provide. So, no wonder there’s no internet options in certain areas, because the little guys have to provide a level of internet that they can’t afford because of regulations on standards of bandwidth. Without Net Neutrality, smaller companies can move into areas and offer cheaper lower bandwidth services to poorer people, so at least those folks can have SOME KIND of internet, which would then force the big companies already in the area to offer similar services to compete, and in general increase their customer base overall, by providing to all levels of consumers. Also, if you create an internet fast lane for certain services, the slow lane will increase in speed as well, and won’t be as slow as you think, because bandwidth heavy services will be separated into their own lane thereby creating more room in the “slow” lane.",0.6976,191
