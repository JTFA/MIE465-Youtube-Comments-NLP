"There is some play in the sled's structure that is used for steering.  The skill is in the rider's ability to steer into the turns in such a way as to increase their speed.  As is stated in the video, the g-forces more than quintuple the stress on your musculature, exponentially increasing the difficulty of these incredibly fine movements -- a mistake in which could spell death for the rider.  In short: the skill is first  in one's sprinting speed (all racers agree that one wins or loses solely during the initial running portion), and is then centered around precisely harnessing one's momentum to slingshot around the turns in order to increase speed.  So yeah, in spite of outward appearance, there is a tremendous amount of skill and physical endurance involved.  To get an idea of the endurance aspect, try lying on your bed in the skeleton-position whilst balancing a thirty-pound weight on top of your head for thirty seconds;  it's not easy.  (But seriously -- put question-marks after your questions, guy...)",-0.434,194

It is quite easy to get from the top to the bottom with only a few testing bends depending on what track. The difficulty is doing it faster and consistently.",0.4754,71
Two things well three things I like. They all involve speed. First 70MPH on a bicycle with the attendant huge hill and a speedo on the bike. Second the Moutain Slide at Attitash in New Hampshire.

"VK im not the YouTube police, I'm not entitled to call out every single person for any wrongdoing or ignorant things they've done. I called you out because I wanted to and I just found it funny that you tried to get back at the OP and say that black people should get the stick out of their asses, with no idea what race the op could've been. The word Damn is an English word that's been used as far back as middle English. It isn't black. It's English and everyone says it. Therefore you're ignorant for assuming that only black people would say prejudiced things against whites and furthermore you're even more ignorant for trying to justify it because the OP said damn. Just admit it you're ignorant. Don't point fingers, just take it and leave.",-0.9219,148
