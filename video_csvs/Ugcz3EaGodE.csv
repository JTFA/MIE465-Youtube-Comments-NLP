I don't get why people don't like pit bulls they are only dangerous if abandoned or not trained or taken care of well I should know because I have a pitbull in fact one we took her to the dog park and they with 2 sections and 1 was for big dogs and 1 for little dogs and we put her in the big dog section and she was super scared and when we put her in the little dog area she was doing much better just goes to show how ignorant people can be.,-0.0284,96

"Most Pitties are world class cuddlers, but you do have to get their trust if they've been in a bad place before you got them.  Ours was on the market by a thug, attempting to sell her as a bait dog, but the authorities stepped in before any trust issues had the chance to develop.  As a result, she was a trusting cuddler from day one.  :-)",0.9209,74

"Very nice vid, nice dog, but I will never fully trust pitbulls. And please don't tell me it's the owners that make them attack because that is fallacy. Instances of attacks by pitbulls is more than all other breeds combined, so there is no coincidence of that proportion that could occur where mostly bad owners own pitbulls causing them to attack. It is simply bred into their DNA. I don't care how sweet a pitbull is because even the sweet ones have turned too many times to count. If I hear of one more child mauled by a pitbull, I will lose my mind. My niece and nephew barely averted a mauling by two ""sweet"" pitbulls owned by their neighbors years ago. The former owner of our gym had to kill a pitbull with a pipe because it was mauling an old man in our town. And this was a ""sweet"" pitbull as told by its owner. Baloney!
