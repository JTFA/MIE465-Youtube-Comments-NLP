"But I'm gonna put it out there. The vibe I get from this, its going to be a much more expensive colorpop one. Like if this isn't going to be a Sephora exclusive range, I'll probably be surprised. Coz I think if they have a more expensive range on their website, um, idk, ppl would really buy it?

People would buy it. But I think it would be people like me. People that aren't scared to delve into affordable makeup, and were impressed with it and then happy to invest in something else. But I think the key thing would be is a store presence, so people can feel the quality. Because we all know that colorpop packaging is like flimsy, but for the product ya like that's fine.

But these look like they have metal bullets and stuff, so they have clearly put a lot more money into the packaging and more money into the formula.",0.9661,176
"But what is it? Matte? Sheer? Satin? Glossy? Are there many finishes or only one finish? Is it the same formula as the lippie stix finishes?! This doesnt tell us anything...

"Exactly! What is the hype about these lipsticks anyway. Why is the marketing trying to make it seem so special? Anyways, Im predicting it right now. In the next couple years Colourpop will go from being inexpensive to being just affordable in the price range right below low high end.

They'll probably run for the money bags in time...it's only such a big deal because they make these statements, mottos and everything regarding price, acknowledging how much they mean to makeup lovers on a tight budget, but we all know it's easy for companies/brands to be permanently poisened by greed after humble success...",0.5404,117

"I know you want to grow your business and reach people who wouldn’t necessarily enjoy the unique products but I’d really like it if you could launch some fun stuff for those of us who still want some excitement. 

I own about 75 items from you (just tried to count). The reason I started wearing colourpop was because you guys had unique products that no one else had for an affordable price. A lot of your recent launches (starting with your pressed eyeshadows) are moving the company more mainstream and it’s losing the charm. Not only is it the types of products but also the colors, the reason you became popular was for the insanely bright crazy colored super shock shadows and now a lot of your recent releases have been more “natural” tones. I used to spend a lot of money and order colourpop very frequently but I haven’t placed an order in over a year. I still love the company but I’m just missing the colourpop that set trends instead of following them.",0.9775,199

I think if they're making good cruelty free products in the US I'm happy to pay a bit more as needed.

Personally a story about ""we f--ked up and then we fixed it to be the most amazing thing ever"" just don't compel me to buy the product.

"Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks this is fine but doesn't see a real reason for this lipstick release, nor the hype and marketing that it's something ""revolutionary"" and extra special, AND is worried that Colourpop is going to price these significantly higher than their other lipsticks...

Honestly, I'm only seeing very subtle clues here and there so far, but I'm getting scared of them becoming tempted by greed. Like, what if ""luxe"" lines will become a gradual branch in order to phase their way into a mid price range in the next couple years... (mid between inexpensive and high end...""somewhat affordable"", if you will). I thought the whole point of Colourpop is how much they're able to mean to makeup lovers on a tight budget as well as anyone. The quality + variety for the price is what makes them special or even unparralleled...they've even made statements and mottos acknowledging how much their inexpensive pricing means and how they'd stay sincere about it. I hope they won't become liars is all. I know someone will probably say ""You're looking too far into it, calm the fuck down you complaining little shit"" or something lol but this is how I feel!

PS. I'll be trying these out anyway as long as they're $8 and not over.",0.964,252

"So... first time buyer and definitely last time here. Here’s my story, I’ve heard so many wonderful things about the products and there was a big sale last year so I ordered a few things, my purchase date was 17 Dec 2017, then I’ve got an email telling me my order has been shipped on 21 Dec 2017. On 26 Dec it said my order has reached the destination country but since then I haven’t heard anything at all, until 19 Jan it said it is now on its way again, I was so relieved that I’m finally getting my stuff after so many emails with their “Customer Service” whose only service I’ve ever gotten from is replies using templates over and over and didn’t even tried answering or helping (byw, why still bother replies with a persons name like you give a damn?). Until today I checked again and it is now shipped back to colourpop for god knows what reason, I’m desperate to get in touch with a real person working here, I’ve tried emailing them and that’s a massive fail, I tried tweeting them. I just want the damn stuff I order or a money back if I were to not get it. This experience has been more stressful than it should have been I am deeply disappointed never have I ever had such bad experience buying online cosmetics, this company by far is the worst I’ve ever encountered in my entire life, customer service who couldn’t even give a shit about your problems locating their own shipment and a customer who waited a month just to get a confirmation that their stuff is now back with its original sender.
