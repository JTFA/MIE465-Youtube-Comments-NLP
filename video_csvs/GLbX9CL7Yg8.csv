"Okay, so admittedly he's right about the anger thing and JT's Prince tribute. I already had my hackles up before I started watching. If it wasn't JT ""pretending"" to be anything ""close"" to my precious Prince, it was ""how dare he sit at a purple piano?"" I've backed off tho in retrospect. I don't mean to excuse my behavior, but I'm still grieving. Prince seemed to be ""there"" for me during very difficult periods of my life so even while he was alive I was very defensive of him. Now that he's gone, I somehow feel I must stand up for him now that he can't. ""Prince said such and such at such and such time, and so that means he wouldn't have approved of such and such."" That's unfair, because I'm leaning on my own flawed, and still grieving, interpretation. Thanks for making me laugh at myself (I can't speak for the rest of the Purple Army - the majority of which may disagree with me - so I'm only speaking for myself). JT's tribute to Prince touched me enough to make me cry despite my determined anger at him, so now I humbly thank JT for honoring Prince when he didn't even have to.",-0.9523,238

"Wow, there sure are a lot of haters in these comments. Seems to be so trendy these days to spew hate in anonymity. Is it because Trevor is ½ black and not John Stewart that your hate and rudeness are rampant here?  For a guy from South Africa, Trevor has more education and insight into our culture, our psyche, and our politics, than most Americans do. Perhaps his intelligence might be wasted on a lot of you and perhaps you should just watch some other late night comedy--like Sean Hannity re-runs.  John Stewart chose him. 

I could not have gotten through this horrific election campaign and so-called presidency without Trevor. I prefer humor and laughter to cap the night rather than the trauma of Trump's incredibly bad, reality WH show.  Thank you, Trevor for helping to keep many of us sane in this asylum we have been forced into.",-0.9506,165
