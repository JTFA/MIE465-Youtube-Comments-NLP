 I'm glad to receive this information from you.
 I wish that you have a much better life from now on and that you have the chance to grow up properly and also become happy. Great thanks to that man that picked you up and helped you. Please don't ever do that again, I know life may be very painful at times but suiciding will solve nothing but bring more pain to this world and people. Please try hard to become happy, someday you might find a wonderful boy that will treat you with care and love everyday and if it gets hard sometimes you two are stuck because you don't understand eachother then don't give up. Keep trying to understand or take a step back and tell him the things you can't stand which are difficult for you and also admit your own mistakes. This way you can solve problems with eachother and you have a chance to become happy. I wish you the best thats possible for you. I was worried about you for quiet a time before I had too much worries for my own life and people I know personally. Keep going and best success to you!",0.9935,215

"I just wanted to say that everyone here is worth it. Now you don't see it yourself... but for everyone is a true love in this world. The journey we humans have is finding it. Many times we are wrong... thinking it's the right one and one day we'll notice everything is going wrong. It's sad, depressing... we might feel like we are not worth anything. But that's false... even if that scenario repeats a few times. One day, if we keep being strong and work on ourself and being kind to eachother we will be with that true love. For some it might be earlier and for some later. But you will find your true love. If you think you hate yourself because you mess it up yourself then work on yourself until you get it right. Of course yes, we can miss our chances. But new chances will open again. Don't give up... that's the biggest succes. Everyone will be rewarded for what they do. Be nice to eachother, don't hate yourself and keep walking towards your future in good and bad times and share it with who you love. Everyone got love somewhere.... everyone <3 :)
please never suicide, never! I admit i had thoughts of that too but over some years I started resisting it. I want to live. I want to be with my true love. Even if it takes a long time... suiciding is surrendering to your own weakness. That's no insulting at all... we need to fight it all the time. We might be thinking too much and be too depressive over things which also got good sides that we are not seeing right away. If you stay alive and fight and work further to what you seek then you will reach it. We have times of terrible pain and feel like dying. But it can never be undone. Pain will fade... someday. There's a cure for every pain. Love is the best cure to the pain you have in your heart and mind. Endure it... Fight it.... Resist it.... even if you think you can't. Give it your all and one day you will be happy. Don't let your true love get passed to someone else because you suicided. He/she is waiting for you. You will receive all the love you ever needed. Just stay strong my dear people. <3 <3 <3",0.9988,453

"I quite loved this trilogy. Overall, I find very intriguish, being a westerner how Japanese culture approaches suicide and death overall. Of course this is a pshycho/horror, however there is clearly a different approach to suicide in Jap mentality. I do not really have an opinion on what brings Japanese ppl have such attitude towards suicide, but I find it very respectable still shocking",-0.7104,73

Sometimes i hear all she is making. In the school, i am bullied by all my classmates, and even teachers hate me. My grades are very bad, and i am sure i never will go to university. My only light in the  life was animes, mangas, games and music. But today, i was raped by 6 mens. They all already is 40---? years old i think.
