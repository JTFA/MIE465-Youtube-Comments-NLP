"Hate to say it,  but Pentatonix and Hudson sound like a group of wannabes singing this song compared to Home Free. Their version was one that I could truly feel and connect to. I could sense the passion in that. This one seems like something PTX did just to get it over with. Talented group, but sometimes, they have train wrecks too.",0.9716,70

"I just watched Home Free's version of this song and saw this as a suggested video.  I listened to this twice because I really like PTX and wanted to give it a fair chance.  Sorry, but this wasn't up to their usual fantastically high standards.  I think part of it was the arrangement.  There was very little bass, and the upper registers were overwhelming what little there was.  Now I will  get in trouble. I simply don't care for Hudson's voice or style.  Sorry, but none of you are big and bad enough to MAKE me like her singing.  Get over it.  I think I will just stick to PTX by themselves in the future.",-0.7654,128

He seemed to move less than the others in the group, which is the main similarity I noticed from my own experience. I really hope to see him grow into the group more and become his own personality to blend in with the group!
While it is a shame that Avi couldn't keep going, I'm very happy to have someone with just as good of a voice and hopefully we'll all get to hear more of it (in other parts instead of just the bassline) as time goes on!",0.8826,132

I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, my burden
gladly bearing He bled and died
to take away my sin

What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
With humble adoration
And then proclaim My God
