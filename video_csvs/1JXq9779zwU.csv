So please, next time use something universal for comparison. For example, use Earth.  Radius of 16Psyche is 113 km, radius of Earth is 6371 km. So 16Psyche = 1/56 Earth.

We can never actually go to the centre of the earth because of the pressure that is packed into it. I mean imagine a giant bottle of coke and digging into the earth like pocking a hole into it with a needle. It will erupt so profusely that it might actually do a lot of damage. And this if we ever are able to make a probe that could withstand molten metal and rocks and that kind of pressure. So it is never going to happen or better never should happen.,-0.296,96
