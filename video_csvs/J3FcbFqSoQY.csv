"""HURR DURR CABNCER!!!"" Seems to be a common response to this video, but really, the risk-benefit trade-off seems fairly good, considering AAVs are pretty well understood, and are not giving everyone cancer. Yes, the risk is there, but there are millions of people who knowingly expose themselves to much worse carcinogens for much less benefit than curing their life-long disease.

Overall, I'm really feeling a ""this guy did in a few months what I have to spend years just to test on rats"" type of jealousy from academic researchers who are criticizing this video on the basis of not following the necessary guidelines for conducting a study, even though this really isn't meant to be one.",0.8833,134

"@Justin Aktin, Hello, I know why if your method had only worked for several days, why it would have happened, and was not been forever a change of your cells, to explain why if this would have happened that you were only cured for a short period of time you need to understand what happens when the immune system gets involved with Gene Therapy, In short, if the Immune system detects that a cell has been infected with a virus, it starts to hunt and kill the cells that have been infected and carry the genetic change, which is not what happened to the cells in your small intestine your immune system not rejecting the genetic change because it had not cared or detected the cells had been infected with the Viral Vector, but thinking this was a Virus trying to cause disease and not cure your intolerance of Lactose.  This would have caused a reversion of the effects as these cells where by immune natural selection breeded out of your body by the immune cells allowing the normal lactose defective cells to reproduce and a decline in the number of modified lactose competent cells leading to the extinction of the new cell line in your body and the reemergence of the old cell line with lactose defective genes as the immune system did not allow the modified cells to reproduce being infected by a virus at one point. Try using a protein coat that the immune system does not detect, AAV are always noticed by the immune system. Their Protein  coat was simply not designed for that purpose by nature, to dodge the immune system, If this happens ever.

You are very lucky that, it did not kill you, if the immune system had really freaked out it would have started killing both types and rejected your entire Small Intestine Organ like in failed Organ Transplants......

Viral Immune Response, the cells where killed by Natural Killer cells since it returned within 3 days, the Innate Immune system rejected your alterations of the cells because it was done via a Virus it detected or absolutely didn't like the infection of.

http://cmr.asm.org/content/18/3/541/F2.large.jpg

None the less, a nice attempt.

You do not know you came to having the visit a hospital and them say they cannot fix it on that day had probability and your T-cells' or Natural Killer cells' DNA been a little different. Be more cautious next time before altering your Genetic Code.

I tend to agree with the Neuroscientist on Reddit about this as a Biophysicist while Gene Therapy is a promising tool, like all tools it can be harmful if used improperly. I design those Viral Vectors, you are using, The problem is the AAV Envelope protein coat, if that happens.

Vector Problem:
GENE = Rep 2 in the packaging Plasmid, the gene that codes the Hexons and Pentons on the Viral Vector.

https://images.nature.com/full/nature-assets/nrmicro/journal/v6/n7/images/nrmicro1927-f4.jpg

But, it seemed to work, so great success, that is all that matters does it work or not in reality, by the 2 week mark you would absolutely know if your immune system is going to reject it or not, which may be why you had a slight occurrence on day 2 - 3 as your immune system was still deciding whether to continue killing them or accept the change in those cells.

In any case,  this does without any doubt prove that Viral Vectors and Bio-Nanorobotics work on human subjects.

"A very silly comment, I will deconstruct it point by point. First of all, my argument doesn’t hinge on nature. It hinges on morality and ethics. Now, you said ethics were an abstract human concept. Technically, every form of human knowledge is abstract and human. That doesn’t mean morality shouldn’t be applied consistently and based on empathy. You accuse me of appealing to nature, but then you make the fallacy of assuming that eating other animals is justified because it happens in nature. Of course nature is no authority. When I said that drinking another species’ milk is unnatural I was simply saying that it is not supposed to be happening.
     So comparing human suffering to animal suffering is immoral. Why? What is the difference between the two groups that would justify moral degradation of either if applied to either? You are just making arbitrary distinctions between groups of sentient beings without justifying them. That is not how logic works, and if you have no problem with morality being applied in this way, then you have no logical basis for objecting to someone who wants to deem certain groups of humans worthless with no justification. You are plain wrong in making such a distinction. Animals, farm animals in specific, are like humans in that they both have subjective experience, basic emotion, and a will to live. This is enough to grant any being moral value because that is the point at which a being values itself, and morality is based on empathy. I like human beings just fine, as long as they’re not morally confused nitwits like you.
     So I don’t understand how empathy works even though I’m the one who values the lives of sentient beings because they value themselves. Care to support your position at all? They want to live. You force them to die, and you’re going to tell me how empathy works? Yeah, no. Fuck right off.
     If you’re insinuating that animals don’t value themselves, then you’re just plain wrong, again. These are assumptions you’ve made to justify a position you already hold. You have not come to them logically. Again, I have no problem with humanity in itself. If you would like to argue that, provide some evidence. I only have a serious problem with the way humans see other animals and the relationship they have with them. That’s it. Also, even though I use the words “pure” and “supposed” and so did Hitler, it does not follow logically that I agree with Hitler in any way. This is a guilt by association fallacy. If you’re insinuating I’m like Hitler because I would rather humans be extinct than causing the death and suffering of billions, trillions of innocent sentient beings for all eternity, then you don’t have the slightest clue what Hitler stood for. You also have a severe lack of perspective. Of course I’d rather humanity survive and go vegan, but that’s it. Holocausts of any kind are not tolerable. Period.

"Extremely dishonest intellectually. I specifically said that when I said it’s unnatural to drink another species’ milk I was simply saying that it shouldn’t be happening and that my argument doesn’t hinge on this.
     Then you didn’t read my comment at all. Even if you accept that intelligence makes people relatively more valuable than animals, it does not follow logically that any level of intelligence that is subhuman has absolutely no moral value whatsoever. In that case you would be devaluing the mentally handicapped as well.
     You say that there is no place for other animals in the world that humans are building. I don’t necessarily agree, but this is utterly irrelevant when it comes to holocausting other species in that it is no justification. If there’s no place for them let them die out. Don’t cause their death and suffering.
     You are completely ignoring the basic fact that both humans and animals have subjective experiences when you speak about veganism in terms of technical results purely. You are causing the death and suffering of trillions of innocent beings, and the only reason their population is so high in the first place is their exploitation by humans. To keep their kind alive is no justification for holocausting them, and there are humane ways of preservation. I have already addressed this.
     This paragraph and onwards shows exactly how you didn’t read my comment. To automatically assume that human suffering and animal suffering are incomparable when that is the whole argument is begging the question or affirming the consequent, which is the technical term for circular logic. I specifically remember asking you in my last comment to justify your distinctions between humans and animals and you respond by saying “because humans are us and animals are not humans”. You cannot say that non-humans don’t deserve any moral value because they are not human. That is circular logic because in that statement you are supporting your conclusion with itself. You can also use that to justify anything “black people are not of moral value because they’re not white.” It’s the same logic, and if you baselessly object to using it in a human context, then that is affirming the consequent again. As I said previously, you have to justify your distinctions, and you have no justification because both humans and animals have subjective experiences and therefore value themselves. “They are also us.” shows a tragic failure in empathy. Just because someone is not you or part of your group does not make them valueless. That is obvious egotistical thinking, and you have no right to be telling me about empathy when you base your morality on that.
     You have no coherent concept of what empathy is, and you didn’t understand logical consistency at all. To represent my argument with “blah blah blah” and then immediately dismiss it by affirming the consequent. Again, what gives you the right to morally degrade them so? Also, reduced emotional centers? Do you care to support your claims? You also appeal to intelligence. That they will never conquer the stars or cure cancer is no justification for holocausting them. If lack of intelligence justifies causing a being suffering and death, then the mentally handicapped also have no rights and it’s okay to holocaust them, which is something Hitler believed. I also mentioned this in my last comment, and you completely ignored it and read it all as “blah blah blah”.
    In short, you didn’t even address any of my arguments. You didn’t even attempt to support your arbitrary distinctions. You just restated them, and then you conclude with the same unsupported conclusion, that an animal holocaust is incomparable to the human holocaust, a claim for which you have provided no support.

No you didn’t state you think the world is better off without people.  But that’s the end result of equating people and animals, seeing as it is people that are reshaping the earth’s environment.  Adapting it to better suit us, and in that world, there is no place for many types of animals, however many others are thriving.

Going vegan would not change anything other than billions of livestock and their entire species would go extinct.  Morally debatable conclusion there.

I’m no saying people should be out torturing animals or shooting lions in pens, that’s immoral for different reasons.  However, I would never compare an animals suffering to that of a person.  Humans have more potential.  They are also us.

In my opinion, yes, your empathy is misguided.  You are anthropomorphising animals.  You’re saying, if I was a cow, blah blah blah.  But you can’t imagine that.  They have tiny frontal vortexes, reduced emotional centers.  They can’t process or see the world the way we do.  They will never conquer the stars or cure cancer.

Why change that? With the rise of non dairy based ""milks"" and cheeses it has become so much easier for people to enjoy the recipes without needing dairy. Dairy production is one of the most inefficient food markets to date. Cows require tons of resources that could otherwise could be used to benefit the human population. This drugs would only incentivize people to make more poor choices. 

I applaud you on your work ethic to try and change the lives of others for the better. It's just a difficult subject because the amount of dairy that is used in most restaurants in the US is astounding (basically everything contains some type of dairy). I think that one day we could enjoy dairy products again. However, the worlds dairy consumption needs to be lowered dramatically and the only way to do that at this point is to avoid it all-together.",0.9761,238

Empathy evolved as a survival mechanism.  It evolved to help us survive in groups.  Groups did better than individuals.  You are taking empathy meant for each other and applying everywhere but to other people.  That is your right, but I think it’s a borderline mental disorder.

And you didn’t read my whole comment because I explained that the majority of mammals have reduced frontal vortexes and emotional centers, because they do need to think and plan ahead, they try on scent and urges to feed and mate and whatnot, and they do not need to understand the emotions of other in order to survive.  We do.  Hence our empathy.  

Listen I’m a liberal, but I’m also a rationalist.  I studied anthropology in college.  I understand evolution, the evolution of human societies, how cultural institutions and cultural traits rise, fall, and are transmitted.  Saying all that, I have no problem with a vegetarian lifestyle.  But I will not listen to someone say it is UNNATURAL and not comment.  That is unhistorical, unscientific, you name it.

Further, you will not convince anyone to adopt your point of view by comparing people to animals.  By calling it a holocaust...  If you want to convince people, stop trying to trigger their dead-puppy response and start talking about the health benefits.

Also, sheltering a sentient being does not justify exploiting that being for their bodily secretions and then taking their life for their flesh. This is not a symbiotic relationship because the cows gain nothing but suffering and death. It is parasitism if you want to speak in biological terms. Secondly, you are plain wrong if you assume that cows have no mental capacity whatsoever. They have the same basic problem solving skills a dog or human toddler would have if not more. However, there is no doubt that when compared to humans, their intelligence is marginal yes, but if this truly justified enslaving them and holocausting them, then it would also be justified to enslave, torture and kill mentally handicapped humans. You cannot reject your own argument in one context but accept it for the other without creating a double-standard unless there is a difference between humans and cows that would justify moral degradation of either if it were applied to either. There isn’t because they both have subjective experiences. Don’t be stupid. Human slaves were given shelter too, but that didn’t justify slavery, and if you want to call false analogy, then name a morally salient difference between humans and animals (see above).",-0.9836,263

"They sound remotely similar?  Lol so hard!!!!  Haha, who says something like this that definitive on the internet and doesn't google it first?  You are one arrogant mother fucker Vincent.  Carl Linnaeus used this word when he created the modern taxonomic system.  Mammal is the anglicized version of the Latin Mammalia which literally translates as ""of the breast"".  Mammals are the ONLY animals who produce milk.

People who don't understand basic biology and the processes of evolution very commonly make straw-man arguments like the one you make here.  You re-frame what I said into something I didn't say that ""sounds bad"" like sucking down milk meant for baby cows (calves is the word you're looking for here).  In truth, the mutation of adult lactose tolerance in modern humans spread rapidly throughout the worldwide gene pool.  30% or more of us have it in under 10,000 years.  That implies that this mutation dramatically increased the opportunity to survive to reproduction age, evidenced solely by its incredible diffusion.

Saying things like ""people weren't meant to..."" are extremely moronic.  Nature doesn't ""mean"" to do anything.  It is simply a result of natural chemical processes interacting with natural forces such as natural selection and time.

If you want to make an ethical or moral argument against dairy products, that's one thing, but saying that it's unnatural is MORONIC.  I'll explain with a further, by this flawed logic (See what I did there Vincent?  I used the same word you did.) we could say that literally just about anything humans are not ""meant"" to do.  We are not ""meant"" to live indoors, to farm, to read, write, to type moronic things on the internet, et cetera.  I think you understand, right?  Haha, what a clown.  How about you go back and live in the woods, naked, eat, sleep, fuck and live for 20 years or so as a woman and 35 or so as a man.  That's the natural way to do it (sarcasm)...",-0.7996,392

"We're not ""meant"" to eat anything. However, we have a digestive system set up to eat pretty much anything. We are explicitly omnivores. Humans started drinking milk because it's a convienant source of lipids and protein, and drinking it won't kill you, unlike the water they had at the time. So milk which made them poo their brains out, was seen as a better option that water that makes you poo to death. A mutation allowing people to do that without the stomach issues occured in several regions around the world  and spread quickly. There is no food you've ever eaten that hasn't been hand crafted by generations of humans fucking with it. More to the point, I don't care about drinking milk. Milk products are in everything and I just don't want to have to aggressively check labels or risk getting sick if I make a mistake. And you're never going to convince people to stop producing milk, short of all the cows suddenly dropping dead. So it's not going away, I was suffering, so I did something about it.",-0.9647,202

Educate yourselves on animal agriculture. It is literally destroying the planet, your health, and of course, is completely unethical. There are plenty of documentaries out there ""Earthlings"" ""What the Health"" ""Cowspiracy"" and ""Forks Over Knives"" have been the most popular. Check them out to learn the truth.

Here's a hint: the truth will never be told by government agencies, the media, the animal agriculture industry, or the healthcare industry.
