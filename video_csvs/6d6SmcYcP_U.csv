"I don't understand why people are so upset that they didn't edit it out. Mistakes happen, and she's in 6 inch stilettos and a huge costume plus like 10 pounds of wings on her back. She's worked her butt off for the show and to be as successful as she is now and people just need to understand that it happens and that one moment doesn't define her as a model or as a person. Showing her crying backstage I think it just shows how much she cared about her performance and was really upset about it. I hope they got her consent though. And the model helping her up was great because it shows how VS is like a family within themselves. People often assume that models are just effortlessly gorgeous with perfect bodies but they work SO HARD for their chance to spend like 2 minutes on a runway. Despite being a model Ming Xi is human too and things like this happen. We should be supporting her instead of getting angry at CBS for not cutting out the footage.",0.8979,192

I feel so bad for her it was in her hometown and her family was in the crowed watching. I know they film VSFS twice but still they shouldn‚Äôt have shown her crying backstage.

I think people would be angry again if the would not show the fall saying ''OH WHAT'S THE MATTER IF SHE FELL DOWN WHY DID YOU EDIT IT LIKE FALLING IS EMBARRASING WE ALL CAN FALL DOWN IN LIFE ITS NORMAL BOO'' etc. the only part that annoys me is they showing her in tears except that i find its normal to air it that way.,-0.6448,72

"I truly feel bad for her, I mean tbh she had been receiving a lot of mean comments lately, major bloggers and celebrities in china have been bashing her, major news and headlines are actually shaming her fall instead of encouraging her. And this is due to the fact that she once joked on a Chinese reality show that if she ever fall on Victoria‚Äôs secrets runway, she will probably just retire. Many netizens have been laughing at her for that reason. In addition, another major thing that she‚Äôs criticized for is how she handled the fall unprofessionally, she took forever to get up, made the fall and accident super obvious, the models behind her had to wait and the entire show was sort of delayed. And this show is supposedly AA‚Äôs last show in Victoria‚Äôs secret(therefore she‚Äôs the last model to come out) , but because of Ming‚Äôs fall, by the time AA got out, the music already faded, and the stage is technically closed. Chinese people are actually shaming Ming for her immaturity in handling the issue and accident,  and not being a ‚Äú professional model‚Äù , and after her fall, Ming sort of gave up after she stood up, she didn‚Äôt finish with a confident cat walk, instead she just dragged herself off the stage and her walk was described as ‚Äúcrappy‚Äù by the Chinese media. Honestly, I do feel horrible for her, and everything I said was from a Chinese critic I‚Äôve read.... I really do not think it is a major issue. And I think that fall was just too harsh for anyone, especially when millions of people are watching.  Please show her some support instead of bashing her for the fall.",0.2031,337

Honestly i know her now because of this and i'm now a fan",0.4009,73
