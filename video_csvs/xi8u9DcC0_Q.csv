I'm unsubscribing. I won't be back. My views and my support will be going to Abe and Michael's new ventures and anything else I see come from those briliant folks you so foolishly fired and pushed out.

Not forgetting where's the fucking string moments if you use tampons. Pulling them out and dripping blood on the toilet floor hastily wiped up with wet tissue paper, and a horrible stinky period smell emanating from your smelly hole. Blobs and globs in the toilet running down in strings from your bits in various fetching shades of wine, only dont drink it.

Thats what periods are like.

Funny video though.",-0.8677,145
"Yeah, tampons aren‚Äôt as dangerous as they‚Äôre portraying. To get tss you would have to leave a tampon in for a long time, like at least 12 times the recommended 8 hours max time. I mean you‚Äôd have to either lose that thing or not even notice it in you long, like forgot it‚Äôs in there and figure you took it out by only checking your crotch for string absentmindedness. Tampons move up. I‚Äôve seen the results of tss in a patient, let‚Äôs just say it took 4mos for her to realize. I mean an allergy could trigger it early, but more than likely cases of tss is the result of leaving a non absorbable foreign object inside an orifice for too long. That‚Äôs why the warning states to not leave in longer than 8 hours because you could risk tss. If you leave any foreign object inside your body for too long there‚Äôs always a risk of it leading to causing a life threatening infection, especially if it blocks the flow of bodily waste being expelled out of your body. If you‚Äôre not ok w putting something unnatural up your vagina, that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt lie about it because it freaks you out. It‚Äôs because of shit like this I can‚Äôt find my type of tampons anymore. People are afraid of using fragranced. Periods smell. It‚Äôs not because men are freaked out, it‚Äôs because when you take a shit, no one wants to smell it when you throw the toilet paper you wiped your shit covered ass with, that‚Äôs disgusting. And the blue thing is fine because there‚Äôs little kids that watch those commercials, I wouldn‚Äôt want my toddler getting into my tampons and trying to shove them inside themselves or other people when there‚Äôs blood or sticking pads to people. Toddlers are sneaky and fast, well my kid was at that age. There‚Äôs commercials and media that discusses periods openly during prime time now, even men are discussing it on talk shows w women. This video is at least 8 yrs too late and forcing an OPINION down our throats. It‚Äôs not factual. Leave my scented products alone, I don‚Äôt like to sit and smell my shit let alone my period. If you like to do that and you‚Äôre fine smelling your rotting bloody skin that‚Äôs your thing, but don‚Äôt make me endure it too. I‚Äôll shove air freshener up your vagina if you force me to smell my own period for a week. This video is the equivalent to stating that you shouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed when you shit yourself and you should just sit in it all day and never change your pants. Who cares if people are disgusted by you walking around smelling like literal shit because you actually are walking around with shit in your pants or decided to just shit your pants right in front of everyone.",-0.9975,576
