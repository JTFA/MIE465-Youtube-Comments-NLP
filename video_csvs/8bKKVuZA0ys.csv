"Cinderella they wear a FAKE TAN. it is not the same thing as being naturally darker skin. it's a BIG BIG difference. the _western_ aspire to be tanned because it shows u have money to travel etc and in other countries such as in south east asia and south america it is a ideal to be as white as possible because HISTORY. white people colonized these countries and blablabla it's world history and i feel like everyone should know this without me rambling.

"Key word is ""tanned."" It is trendy to be tanned, yes, for white women. The girl in the video is naturally quite brown-skinned and there weren't many famous Latinas in American pop culture - there still aren't! If there is one they're often light skinned, with light hair and light eyes. Being ""white"" (as in, Caucasian) has always been the trend in America (and Europe obvs) so seeing a Latina succeed and thrive in Hollywood was inspiring to the woman in this video, because she is Latina herself. Yes of course there shouldn't be an enforced beauty standard, I think we should all appreciate what we were born with, appreciate each other's unique beauty, without feeling pressured to look a certain way.",0.9784,144

"Not true at all, look at lindsay lohan, paris hilton, nicole richie. They were all very tanned, none of them were light skinned. Seriously go look at photo's from the 2000's. Being ""white' has never been in trend (except maybe 100 years ago). Western countries aspire a tanned look. And how about not setting a beauty standard? I think beauty is uniqueness, not wanting to look like those instagram baddies, but just being the way you are blue eyes/blonde hair or dark eyes/dark hair. Seriously why must one be inferior to the other?",-0.7738,117

"PzRz History of skin whitening in Asia dates back to ancient China, India and Japan, according to the report. “In ancient dynastic times, those with fair skin implied wealth and nobility as opposed to servants who labored outside under the scorching sun.”
