"Hey Cody, if you were willing to do a bit of a citizen science project with your bees I have an interesting idea... There was recently a paper published about how small amounts (very small, around 2- 25 milimoles) of lithium chloride was put into the feed for bees and killed 96% of Varroa Mites in the hive. If you would be okay with it, it may be interesting to see if you notice any changes with the bees behavior or have any way to make the system more effective. Just a thought, and if you want to read the paper it's titled ""Lithium chloride effectively kills the honey bee parasite Varroa destructor by a systemic mode of action""",0.5984,132
"Hey Cody, why have you relegated the beekeeping videos to the secondary channel? I figure it may be due to the *non-science* oriented nature of these videos, however I have enjoyed these videos for years now and cannot justify why that would be the case (and I don't even like bees!). Streamline the main channel perhaps? If its because you think these videos are of less importance to your viewers I implore you to reconsider.
