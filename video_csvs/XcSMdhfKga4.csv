"Crikey! From the late 70s into the 80s, the song 'carried' the video. The video was kind of superfluous due to the song being the essential thing. But in the 90s, the song began to be carried by the video as the multi-channel television age began to arrive: the song became relatively less important to the video - and the number of original new melodies soon sank to almost zero into the new millennium. But here, in this latest Mamma Mia movie, the songs have returned to carry the video, the film. It's a bit like an extended pop video. Just as well. Without Abba's songs, albeit sung by the actors, and without the music production, both the script and the characters portrayed would plummet into the realm of mediocrity. What this state of affairs means is that Abba's music deserves better treatment for the stage than these Mamma Mia shenanigans. There is another thing about these two Mamma Mia movies that sticks in my craw: nobody, not one person in it, looks short of money. They all seem well-off. What was great about Abba's foray into the UK music scene in the mid-70s was their great appeal to a great number of people: rich and poor, old and young. They appealed directly to the working classes in Britain as their music had a unique combination of consolation and fun. Abba teased and delighted their audience, too. But this movie has been spun out to appeal to the whims of the well-off and connected smug, I'm afraid. Anybody who remembers the MAGIC of Abba's music, as it was in the late 70s, will not recognise the ... magic, if it exists, in these movies.  In the three-TV-channel Britain of the 70s, when many people could not afford a colour TV, Abba's music was chiefly sweet consolation for many. In fact, millions of people probably only ever heard their music over the daily radio. But as people today, on their smart phones, are in the habit of droning on and on about today's 'bleak times', you'd think that an opportunity to make a meaningful movie or stage musical on an entity that had moved so many forty years ago would not be let go. But it has been let go. I'm afraid. As for fun and humour, there's more humour in Abba's ""Take A Chance On Me"" pop video than there is in the whole of one of these two movies.",0.9926,467

We get to see how Donna met her best friends Tanya and Rosie and how they became The Dynomos
We get to learn about Sam, Bill & Harry's pasts and how they came to meet Donna
We get to learn about how Sophia is doing and finding out how her life is now and how it's changing

and finally

We get to relive our memories from the first movie that made Abba's songs so great plus we get to see the same cast return, they may look different but personally I cannot wait for this I swear to god this sequel is gonna be great! I am so excited for it! :D.",0.9736,172

"hm14 I am not ignorant. I don't care if a black plays a white or the other way around because I believe that a movie should not be based off of that. It's just that people always tend to focus on that and it's annoying. I hate shits like u who think its ok to insult a white person but people go ballistic when someone insults a black and then calls them racist. Neither is ok and you're too blind to see that. Also, those movies you mentioned, do u think i have control over who gets cast as who?! Do u really think I'm ok with that?! When a character has a certain race and the actor/actress who gets cast as them has a different race, I don't think it's a good thing to change that, and i dont get ""hard done by it"" when someone gets mad, in fact i agree that the actor/actress should have the same race as the character but there's nothing I can do! Yes, its wrong to make a character with a different race white, and if i could, I would change that. Dont blame the white people, blame Hollywood. Besides, the mama mia characters didn't have a specific race so why are u losing your shit over something like that?! If u believe so strongly on this, why dont you get off your ass and do something about it?!You probably think I'm white but I'm not. If someone said something insulting like u said to a black person I would say the same thing I'm telling u. You think I'm ignorant?! Listen to yourself!!! You think you know everything about me but u know nothing. You think that just because  defending a white person, that I am white. You think that I'm ok with everything they've done. Well, newsflash, I'm NOT. People like u also prefer to ignore the quality of a movie just because of race. Sure, If that character is supposed to be from Africa or something and they cast them as white, I see your point because that would be wrong but people like u focus on the insignificant things like the race in a movie like this. Honestly, does it even matter?!  Unlike you, I have an open mind about things and am willing to accept the fact that I am wrong. So if you can actually find proof where the island in the movie is supposed to take place and what race the cast is SUPPOSED to be then maybe Ill agree that they shouldnt have cast them as white. But If they're factually supposed to be white, stop whining about it. You probably think you're right and you're opinion will never change so I'm not gonna waste anymore of my time trying to talk to someone like you.",-0.9776,533
