"Good Morning Britain channel disabled comments but i just couldn't help myself but comment on how dim wit the woman in the show is. This fake restaurant may have been originally created just for laughs by that writer but there is a valuable lesson here.. too many to mention. she missed all that and got focused on how ""it was a naughty thing to do"",""you scammed people"" etc... don't you see ? YOU LIVE IN A SCAM ! your life is a SCAM. this prank was actually useful in a sense that it made you realize these things that you live your life thinking was premium was actually just in your mind. It showed how over dependent people have become with the internet world where almost anything can be faked. the illusions that runs through our heads. it also SHOWED the opposite of all this and that is that sometimes there are places you take for granted that are actually quite nice. the prankster referred to his place as ""HELL"" but it actually looks really nice and you could actually set up some sort of coffee shop or a place to gather in the beautiful night and have some peace of mind... lots of things to learn from this.",0.9595,228

Seeing him prance around in red booty shorts, and refer to his pasty white, Casper the ghost, kneecaps/legs as ""Baby dolphin fins"", I expected him to be EXTREMELY QUEER & EFFEMINATE. I did not expect someone who purposely wore pants cut into red, skin tight, crotch hugging booty shorts in freezing weather, with the intent to show off his pasty white ""dolphin fin knees"" with his brogan shoes, to have a deep voice, and not a high pitched, effeminate, sissyboy voice.",-0.0,178

I also work in an industry that is really review oriented.  I know and understand how powerful and influential online reviews can be for a business. If anyone is upset or negatively affected, I would say they need to chill out and really think about the fact that they were influenced by nonsense.

"What you guys did was fantastic. I have traveled all over the world and no longer use trip advisor. When I first started traveling. I would use trip advisor. These business would pride themselves being on the top ranking of trip advisor. 

I noticed the discrepancies between the two when trying some of these places or locations. When I would leave a legitimate review, they would always give me a cop out response and delete/remove my reviews. These business would manipulate the comments to have people come in to just make money off from them, when they where not providing a good service like they mentioned. Meanwhile a really good establishment wouldn‚Äôt have the luxury to know these things and not have the proper attention. I‚Äôm talking about the 3rd would countries of course. 

A lot of the information on trip advisor is not legitimate. People really don‚Äôt listen or believe me. I have learned from experience first hand.  To not trust trip advisor. 

People are being lied to which is not right. I now ask local people for their opinion, and try to do my own research from multiple sources before trusting a place. 

I really do highly warn people to not trust trip advisor since their reviews are not legitimate most of the time.",0.007,244
