Wow thats awesome! Gread joice in music and wonderful editing. Just two things: for me it looked like not all scenes really were 1080p so that would be great and second sometime when someone was talking the music loudness and quietness was too sudden. Keep up the great work :) (sorry for bad english),0.9722,60
