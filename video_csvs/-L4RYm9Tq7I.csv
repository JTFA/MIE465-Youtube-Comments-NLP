Twenty-one North Korean cheerleaders imprisoned
AP , SEOUL            Sat, Feb 18, 2006 - Page 4

Twenty-one members of North Korean cheering squads who traveled to South Korea for international sports events are being held in a prison camp for talking about what they saw in the South, a news report said 17 February 2006.

Citing a North Korean man who recently fled to China, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said the 21 young women had been detained about last November 2005 in the same prison camp where the man had been held.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service didn't immediately confirm or deny the report.

In 2002, Pyongyang sent hundreds of female cheerleaders to the Asian Games in South Korea's Busan, where their tightly synchronized routines drew worldwide attention. The North sent similar cheering squads to South Korea in 2003 and last year.

The defector, whose real name wasn't given, said the female cheering squad apparently violated a pledge not to speak about what they saw in South Korea, the Chosun Ilbo reported.

Citing another unnamed defector, the newspaper said the cheerleaders had pledged before going to South Korea that they would treat the country as ""enemy territory"" and never speak about what they saw there, accepting punishment if they broke the promise.

Pyongyang insists it doesn't abuse human rights, but it has long been accused of holding political prisoners in camps under life-threatening conditions. It is believed to hold between 150,000 and 200,000 political prisoners, the US State Department said.",-0.9172,291

"Good for the future economic prosperity of Korea and peace of the region, but maybe not so good for ordinary South Korean people. We all know what would happen after unification, large influx North Koreans to South Korean cities, competing with existing South Koreans for jobs. College graduates maybe OK, but ordinary people with low skilled jobs would see their salaries and living standard drastically reduced, but usually only 1/4 of people go to college so we are talking about 3/4 of South Koreans won't be doing so good. The re-balancing of economy would probably take few decades, meanwhile people in their 20s ~ 40s will never see any benefits of that, so I fully understand why they think like that.

Of course the good thing of unification is South Koreans would not need to worry about North Korean invasion or nuclear threats anymore, but I think most South Koreans already figured it out that they don't need to worry about it now. For all the tough talk of the north they are just trying to survive, South Korean military technology far exceeds North Korean, it no longer can be overcome by numbers. So as long as South Korea does not invade North Korea, North Korea will never commit suicide and use their nuclear weapons. So I think their main worry now is actually their government or the Americans try to invade North Korea.

South Korean young people are not affected by sentimental feelings, they are thinking of themselves, that is my understanding. 

The ex South Korean president wanted THAAD might be an indication that the previously government backed by Americans thinking of invading the north, that could be the real reason she got impeached. I think majority of South Koreans are not that interested in risking nuclear attacks so their living standards can be lowered.",-0.9551,331

"Honestly. I do NOT think reunification is possible. Its been DECADES since the split between North and South Korea. North Korea is a REGIME and a very corrupted government - they kill people and keep people as victims/terrorize their own people. The government doesn't care about their people and the government/army controls their people - its VERY CORRUPTED. People are NOT FREE. People don't realize how tyrannical Kim Jong Un is and his government is. They are TERRIBLE PEOPLE. 

South Korea got their stuff together and is a democracy. People ARE FREE in South Korea. What do South Korea have to GAIN from unifying with North Korea? NOTHING. 
Why is South Korea so adament on unifying with N. K? When we ALLL know N. Korea is a fked up country.... I just feel so sad for the lost souls in N. Korea, who are suffering every day. 
But it really is NOT South Korea responsibility for the terrible things that the N. Korean government is doing to its North Korean people. That is North Korea's problem - NOT south Korea. 

South Korea is its own country  - its a sovereign country and has its own government/culture/people/society/rules and lastely DEMOCRACY. Its people is FREE. So focus on yourself South Korea. Dont even care about North Korea - because at the end of the day - South KOREA YOU HAVE A LOT OF ALLIES. Whereas - North Korea doesn't. 
So if war is to break out - South Korea will have A LOT OF ALLIES helping South Korea. North Korea wont have any. So who will lose? North Korea - obviously.

If North and South Korea were to unify - there will be 2 different types of GOVERNMENT; Authoritarian/tyranny and Democratic government - and 2 presidents. How is this possible? It will NOT be possible for the 2 country to unify. 

Like one girl said. North Korea doens't have friendly relations with other countries... Why should S. Korea be so friendly towards N. Korea?

EVEN if you are both Koreans - you are still different from North Koreans. They have different culture, lifestyle, and government. It will NOT be possible for North and South Korea to unify. 

North Korea just need to open up to other countries and have more diplomatic ties/relations with other countries.... STOP being little btchs and prideful and just put your pride aside and ASK FOR HELP NORTH KOREA. Or else you just gonna continue to be a little dumb btch that always threaten people with missiles - acting like a spoiled brat who need attention but wont do sht. North Korea just need to have more international relations and stop being all high and mighty thinking they some ""SPECIAL RACE"" above all other people. Pretty sure that North Korea thinks they are special and unique and superior than other races - I've learned that from professors/people/articles/readings.. Why would they still be so isolated? Because they (NORTH KOREA) see their race as special/superior and dont want to contact the outside world or trade with anyone else because they only want to stay within their own race.",0.9475,598

Also they are not up with the latest technology, so the north Koreans have a higher chance of being low skilled worker and finding a job will be very hard for them.

If the reunification happened, then this would mean the Un family would have to give up power or be swallowed up in the South Korean system, and like all dictators of the world, they dont play well with others.

It's ridiculous to take south Korean athletes who have spend their lives training for this, and to remove them from the team to make room for north Koreans. Let them enter their own team, or have three teams. NK, SK, and Unified Korea.

"I'm korean, and I'm honestly unhappy about this, too. If we are to unify, one side will have to give up their leadership. Right now, that's impossible, and just because North and South Koreans are one team in the Olympics, it won't help bring us together. The Olympics are held in South Korea this year. Who knows if they'll ever have another chance to host the games. It just happened to be the year that South Korea is hosting the games, and suddenly North Korea wants to play under the same team. The one year that south koreans can play in their home country, they have to play with teammates that are from another country. Idc if they were unified in the past. Right now in the present, they are separated and are living comepletely different lives. And unifying would basically mean that North Koreans are getting their freedom. It wouldn't really help South Korea, we would just be helping them.

"I'm not entitled to the Korean culture so I may speak nonsenses, but I do think history can give us a help in this situation. Of course the economics benefits to Korea in case of a reunification won't be noted in some decades so it may not sound as a good idea for the new generation in the South. If you think in the reunification just for that reason it will most likely think it is not worth the trouble. But I do think in a utopia, in the sense that they are the same people, separated by a crazy brainwash made by Kim Jong Un and his party. Korea was once divided in many kingdoms, as was many countries in the world, Germany was united in the past and the first step was an economic bloc with Prussia and other Germanic nations. After the economic unification, the national sentiment grew until they felt they were really the same people and after the war against France they were unified. Maybe if NK could open economically it could at least be the first step to unify with the South? It is sad that this situation exists and mostly by other countries doing, the Korean people did not have a choice back then, I just really wish, as a outsider looking, that the North Koreans could at least be liberated from the Kims, even if its to late for unification, but if it's not, I just wish for a country divided by war to find peace and become one once again.",0.8674,280

"It was a very negative surprise for me to see how short-sighted young South Koreans are. I was born in Poland and was 3 years old when communism collapsed. And because of that I can say that those 50 years under the regime was just a small, tiny part of our long history. This is why it's hard for me to understand that people can't see that Korea enjoyed relative stability under one of the world's longest dynasties (Joseon) for so many centuries  just because they themselves were born after the division and have no personal memory of one Korea. Or, they are worried about competing for jobs or the prime time of their players not giving any single thought to the fact that South Korea (like most developed countries) is an aging society. Please try to think ahead 30-40 years and ask yourself the question of who is going to work for your retirement.

If we come to a point in history where South Koreans collectively stop caring about reunification, North Koreans that are dying under clear human rights violations will be left to fend for themselves.

"My solution to this problem would be have NK denuclearize then there is no more need for America to sacrifice the lives of their people and resources in Korea, so they can remove the military bases there and NK and SK need to strike up a deal regarding the administration of Korea. I say expand free trade only between SK and NK, NK‚Äôs development will be slower than having global free trade, but it will be safer for Kim who can maintain his power. It will be good for SK, they can use cheap labor and invest in NK. Limit the movement of people and keep the trade between the two sides and eventually many years later when Kim is too old to care about power Korea will have stabilized and be a stronger independent nation.",0.9593,146

Pretty interesting as to what the South Koreans had to said.

Yes it will do some good on an economic standpoint but since I doubt the North Korean gov't would want to hand over some power I doubt they South Koreans would have a happy future if the Kim family take charge of the whole country that will also cause a lot more trouble for Japan and the United States.

So what do you want? For south Korea to continue sympathizing with the brutal regime of North Korea and to open its doors to communist dictatorship influence? To reunify you need to kill off Samsung and other corporations that built Korea into a strong economy and allow the Kim dictatorship to have some power and influence over South Korea. Reunification seems like the politically correct and fluffy Disneyland type of thing to say we need to do but think logically about this. The current Korean president is a North Korean sympathizer and we‚Äôve allowed the North Korean agenda to be a focus instead of showing the world how far South Korea has come in just a short time. Now you want to take us back to the 1960‚Äôs for the sake of reunification? What does that even mean? Be smart about it not just fluffy feel good.,0.8364,159

South Korea has made many efforts for reunification for the last 50 years. Despite all that it feels like NK is not making any effort in that matter. Which is one of the reason why people starts to give up on it. The NK government probably doesnt wish for reunification anyway unless the entire korea is ruled under them. And the SK is not going to let that happen knowing how they treat their own people. One major factor is that people are fearing that we may not improved NK peoples life but in turn SK people life will be affected negatively instead.,-0.4599,109

Let alone the political abstracts that would arise from it. I don't think Mr. Leader would be ready to give up leadership whatsoever. Apart from that two different society has to be brought at same level before total reunification. That women has remarkably cited an example of how atleast traveling cross border should be allowed for a start.
