"Here's what nobody is mentioning. It is pretty clear that when the lamb was brought back in the 2nd time, the manager was thinking what now? Isn't it cooked more? He initially had a different assumption of the situation.

He asked the waiter what the matter was and all the waiter said was ""she doesn't want it!"" When he could have just explained she found out it was microwaved and wants a new one cooked! 

While I don't agree with their kitchen practices or how the manager handled it was also irritating how the waiter did not care to communicate properly! 

Anyway. Based on the manager's reaction it is obvious he's encountered a number of b-tchy difficult hags that are never satisfied because they just want free meals, and now he's taking it out on this woman. It's wrong. But this female trump look-alike also seems to love drama by the way she talked in some instances. If you have been in customer service long enough you can smell these types a mile away. In all honesty I burst out laughing at this.

Lady, no matter how you cook that lamb you're still going to look like oscar the grump. And those people clapping probably don't know that half the time they're out dining those restaurant staff are microwaving their food and they don't even know it LOL.",0.9033,248
