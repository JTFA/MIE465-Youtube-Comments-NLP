He was rushing it just to say he did and that’s the issue I have with this, the main one at least. It’s an animal, you don’t force it to understand, you use calm actions and act as a leader, not a forcer, and everything will come with time. Not saying you can’t get stern with horses, but this mare was doing nothing to be charged at. Teaching it that it has to be calm when it looks at you by running it off when it isn’t, that’s not a way to teach a horse. It’s a way to run a horse out until they have no more energy to run away from you and they submit.",0.8616,177

"depends do you mean horses that are officially recolonized as wild or unofficially.

officially the only living wild horse is the Takhi.



however there are a bunch of unofficial wild horses that have unique characteristics but aren't considered wild cause they originate from domesticated horses.a good example are the mustangs in the us that descended from the spanish horses first brought to the us.they have basicly completely reverted back to being wild but are not officially recognized as wild.these mustangs have a really unique characteristic where they have stripes on their legs similar to zebra stripes.


here's a few examples of them

"the ""give food"" thing was just an exemple of positive reinforcement instead of just settling dominance. 
""Also when it is feeding time, what do you think he does?"" I don't know, feed the horse ? I don't get your point. What positive reinforcement is, is using this feeding time as a bonding time (and a game time, why not, just like the way you can teach dogs). He might do it, we don't know since as you said, it's not shown by that video. Still, even if he does it it would have been with that pretty stressful experiment before...
That horse is feral, not wild, so it's naturally less wary of humans and curious. Taming it without forcing dominance on it would have taken more time, that's for sure, but it would also have induced less stress for the mare.
""you cannot really comment on a practice that has been successful for hundreds of years..."" Sure we can. In western traditions, we use a metal bit to control the horse. It has been that way for hundreds of year yet there are now more and more people telling that there are other ways to do the same without it being so bad for the horse's jaw and teeth. So define successful, because there is never just one way of seing things. In the bit case, it's sucessful for the rider, not really for the horse on the long run. That can apply to everything. Generally, if you think something is good just because it's old, you're not aiming for progress.

Another exemple: if your cat doesn't want to go into it's carrier, you can either force it to go inside or slowly make the cat okay with it by playing, putting food inside etc. In the end both are successful: the cat is in the carrier, so you might say the first one is the best because it's faster, but the second one is way less stressful for the animal. Same here but since taming a horse is quite a bigger task than just putting a cat in a carrier, it takes more time.",0.9667,407
