"Robert Zemeckis purposely wanted to ""give away"" the ending of CAST AWAY in the trailer. He did this so more people would see the movie thus more box office money. He did the same thing in the FORREST GUMP and WHAT LIES BENEATH trailers too. The end result, CAST AWAY grossed more than $429 million, while FORREST GUMP grossed $677 million and won the Best Picture Oscar and WHAT LIES BENEATH grossed $291 million. The moral of the story is Robert Zemeckis knows what he's doing.

""We know from studying the marketing of movies, people really want to know exactly every thing that they are going to see before they go see the movie. Itâ€™s just one of those things,"" said Zemeckis in the year 2000. ""To me, being a movie lover and film student and a film scholar and a director, I don't. What I relate it to is McDonald's. The reason McDonald's is a tremendous success is that you don't have any surprises. You know exactly what it is going to taste like. Everybody knows the menu.""

Spoiler-free trailers are a good thing and it's good to know that at least companies are making the effort to go the opposite of the lazy method of the past of just giving away the best parts or major turning points in the story right in the trailer.,0.872,49
There is no proof to any of what you claim (i.e. spoiling movies in trailer is a good thing). It is simply lazy marketing to give away spoilers in trailers. People when they watch the trailers are mislead to believe they are not watching spoilers but in reality they are. Zemeckis doesn't know what he was doing. He simply took the easy way out.,0.5346,74
