"He also used the FBI, IRS, DOJ etc as political weapons against his adversaries - like any good commie government would. He also added Ten Trillion Dollars to the National Debt in 8 years - the equal to every other president before him combined for the previous 200+ years, as the economy under him for 8 years had the slowest recovery in 80 years - never once got past 2% GDP growth; wages stagnant; median income dropped; welfare/food stamp rolls grew far larger; blacks did worse under him by every single economic measure, and as it's all reversing under Trump, Obama who said 2% growth (pathetic) was the ""new norm"" claimed Trump would need a ""magic wand"" to get it back to 3%. No, we just needed Obama and his cluelessness, high taxes, stifling regulations etc, gone - and now that it has been over 3% for the last several quarters under Trump, of course Obama (with his bootlicking media helping him) is trying to take the credit. LOL BTW, the housing crash was caused by the Democrats, as Pelosi, Reid, Dodd and Frank etc forced banks to give out sub-prime home loans to people who couldn't begin to pay them back - and of course they, again with the lib media spreading the lies, blamed that on GWB too.

"Walmart is giving a One time bonus, the only people getting the $1000 maximum have to have worked there 20 years or more. Not many of those who last 20 years. Most will not get anywhere near that much. The job turn over rate at walmart is quick, because it sucks to work there. I have family who have worked there both as cashiers and as upper management. What they didn't say so loudly was Sams club (which is walmart) is simultaneously closing 63 stores nation wide. 1000's of people went to work to find a note on the door saying the store was closed and they are fired. 1000's of people losing their jobs.The store near us actually had police posted outside the locked Sams club. No advanced notice to employees.  , but of course you don't hear about that.",-0.25,160
