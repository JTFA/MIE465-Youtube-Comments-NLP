"Chiel Wtf? Of course there are players with weapons but there aren't many complete players anymore.

Mug, Kvitova, Ostapenko, Keys, Pliskova, etc all have big weapons but are either poor defenders, very eratic, or headcases. 

Woz, Halep, Svitolina, Radwanska, etc all defend well but lack any big weapon. Woz's forehand is awful, Halep often lacks enough power to hit through an opponent even when hitting near the lines, Radwanska completely lacks power and has wonky strokes (though she's very crafty and those funky strokes can throw her opponent off sometimes), etc.

The only players I can think of that are really complete other than the Williams sisters are 2016/18 Kerber and 16 FO/17 W Muguruza. Mug has less than outstanding movement but it's more than good enough when combined with her great pace and flat shots. This year though she's been hitting much less hard and putting more spin on, which is really bizarre and foolish.",-0.848,183

"Everyone that thinks she does not have a big weapon in tennis is wrong. before judging her just on highlights let me give you some facts. She has a great serve, she plays very consistent, Her mental game is so strong (match against gavrilova), she is clutch on key moments, she has a very high tennis IQ (she knows/finds the weaknesses from her opponents). I don't know if she can keep this consistency for the whole year but to say she is just an average top 50 player that is just B***S",0.672,109

When Zvonareva has to create her own pace, it doesn't come as natural and with the same angles Kim used to. Athleticism is not even a debate.

As much as I like Zvonareva, she's not Kim.",0.8519,88
"Pretty simple answer: Jorovic, Sinaikova (fair enough she can be pretty good), Kostyuk (same her just too young), Allertova. All fairly easy opponents. I agree people love her because she is really good looking but she will need to add to her game so far everything is very decent and nothing is special. But I can see potential, who knows.

completely agree. she doesn't have a game that can impose when it matters. this usually just doesnt hold up when players all peak in a grand slam and someone will be able to overpower svitolina. same situation as wozzy and halep so far. but i think both wozzy and halep are learning quickly and both may somehow win a slam soon.,0.5182,66
