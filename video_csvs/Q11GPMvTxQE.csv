Gordon Smith ...Chinese is not perfect but they don't take whole cut. Whereas European play soft power and don't leave nothing left for country to progress.  Western Europeans capitalist are very dangerous because they only worry about their own respective nation states economic boost. Free trade only for EU nation without tariff and 80 % tariff on African countries who wants to do trade outside Africa and within Africa . Chinese trade agreement are more like 60/40 % cut . Which is more than reasonable  comparing to European imperialism. Chinese atleast investment heavily before taking out their huge 60% cut .  I am not anti European trade but i dislike their double standards and hypocrisy.  By playing moral authority only when it suit them. Western Europe didn't invent medicine and hospitals in the world but they only progressed medicine and hospital technology. Which they don't share . They use advanced technology only as bargaining chip to advance their values and installing puppet leaders they like. I think you haven't been outside your own bubble.,0.9872,185

*EDOM IS THE SO-CALLED WHITE RACE*

IsraelUnitedinChrist

Genesis 25:19 ‚ÄúAnd these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham‚Äôs son: Abraham begat Isaac: [20] And Isaac was forty years old when took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian. [21]And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. [22] And the children struggled together within her; and she said, if it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.‚Äù

Meaning if the Lord has blessed me why am I having trouble in my pregnancy?

Genesis 25:24 ‚ÄúAnd when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.‚Äù

Not identical twins but fraternal twins (remember they were two different children)

Genesis 25:25 ‚ÄúAnd the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.‚Äù

Notice it mentions the firstborn/the elder child‚Äôs color because he was different from his Mother, father and all other people from the time of Adam. Genesis 2:7 ‚ÄúAnd the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground‚Ä¶(meaning shades of brown.‚Äù 

Esau is red in color, the blood shows in his skin (there is no such thing as white people, they are red) and he‚Äôs a hairy people.

Genesis 25:26 ‚ÄúAnd after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau‚Äôs heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. ‚Äú

Do you notice Jacob‚Äôs color is Not mentioned. This is because he looked like his mother and father and all the other people on earth since the time of Adam.

Genesis 25:27 ‚ÄúAnd the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. [28] And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. [29] And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: [30] And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.‚Äù

The word Edom means ‚Äúred‚Äù. What do so called black people call Caucasians down south? Red-necks. But not just their neck is red, they are red from the top of their heads to the soles of their feet. So Esau gave up his birthright for red rare meat inside pottage. 

Genesis 27:38 ‚ÄúAnd Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father: And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. [39] And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold ,thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;‚Äù

Meaning Edom is blessed to live everywhere and in the best places on earth. 

Genesis 25:40 ‚ÄúAnd by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke off thy neck.‚Äù

This explains how Esau‚Äôs people would live every where on earth and in the best places. By the sword they conquered nations and removed nations from their ancient homes and relocated them under Alexander the Great. Esau even conquered and relocated the Japhetic people of Javan/Greece and became who we know today as ‚Äúthe Greeks‚Äù.

Esau broke the yoke off from his neck in 2 Chronicles 21:8 ‚ÄúIn his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king [9] Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. [10] So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.‚Äù

Malachi 1:[2] ‚ÄúI have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob‚Äôs brother? Saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob, [3] And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.‚Äù 

Proving the Most High God does not love all peoples on the earth. 

Malachi 1:4 ‚ÄúWhereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.‚Äù

Esau became impoverished during the dark ages, between 193 A.D. ‚Äì 1453 A.D. when dark skin people ruled. They returned and built the desolate places during the renaissance era which means ‚Äúrebirth‚Äù. 

Romans 9:11 ‚Äú(for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) [12] It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. [13] As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.‚Äù

Hebrews 12:16 ‚ÄúLess there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. [17] For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.‚Äù

Proving Repentance is not for everyone. 

Obadiah v. 1 ‚ÄúThe vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen. Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.‚Äù

Prophetic for this time to come when one of the heathen leaders among the nations such as the Arabs will convince the nations to rise up against America. 

Obadiah 1:2 ‚ÄúBehold, I have made thee small among the heathen thou art greatly despised. [3]The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, who shall bring me down to the ground?‚Äù

Proving Edom is a proud race of people and that pride has deceived all of them. They dwelled in the clefts of the rocks of Mt. Seir, called PETRA today and then the rocks of the Caucus Mountains of Georgia Russia. Hence the term ‚ÄúCaucasian‚Äù this means cave dweller.

Look up Mt. Seir. Notice how similar Mt. Seir looks like Wall Street. 

Esau‚Äôs habitations are high because of the skyscrapers they like to build; it reminds them of living in the clefts of the rocks. 

Their pride asks ‚Äúwho shall bring me down to the ground meaning who can conquer us?‚Äù because of their missile technology.

Obadiah 1:4 ‚ÄúThough thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will bring thee down, saith the LORD.‚Äù

What is the symbol of America? The Eagle. They set their nest among the stars in 1969 when they landed on the moon and declared ‚ÄúTHE EAGLE HAS LANDED‚Äù this also proves they are filled with pride, their scientific technology. Obadiah verses 1-4 is technically describing Edom‚Äôs main kingdom : America.

Now let‚Äôs go to the end of this matter, when the 12 tribes of Israel gathered together again. 

Obadiah 1:18 ‚ÄúAnd the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and thee house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.‚Äù 

Do you understand the prophecy? There shall be none remaining of Esau saith the LORD. 

Obadiah 1:19 ‚ÄúAnd they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.  [20] And the captivity of the host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sephrad, shall possess the cities of the south. [21] And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD‚Äôs.‚Äù

Proving the last ruling kingdom is Esau‚Äôs and then the Kingdom of the Lord will be established. 

2 Esdras 6-8 ‚ÄúAnd he said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob‚Äôs hand held first the heel of Esau. [9] For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.‚Äù

This explains the meaning of baby Jacob grabbing the heel of Esau. Further proving this last kingdom is Esau/Edom and the Lord‚Äôs kingdom comes soon.",0.9984,1969

Some I am guessing some were Americans due the time  zone they were online. One lived in England.

"Ibrahim Somali Let me take your last comment first.

I lived in Cape Town for 18 years - it's never a clever move to attack anyone if you've no idea who they are.

Puppet leaders: Read post 1949 Chinese history. In 1950 they not only replaced the government of Tibet, they have been replacing the population with imported ethnic Han Chinese ever since. Today the ethnic Tibetans are a minority in their own country.

European medical advances are shared with the world. Of course you can always drop in on your local witch doctor for 'muti' or the Chinese Medicine Shop to pick up some rhino horn or bits of endangered tiger.

A great deal of the older infrastructure in Zimbabwe was built by the British. The Chinese are playing a long-haul game - they're certainly not doing anything for nothing. Essentially, they want raw materials. It remains to be seen whether the African government middlemen pass the benefits down to the people - sadly historic precedence suggests they won't.

The United Kingdom is leaving the EU and the 'Fair Trade' movement, that was founded in the UK, will be seeking trade across the world.

Stigmatising whole nations on the basis of a fading past merely sours current relationships and hinders cooperation. 

80% of the present British population has no personal memory of the British Empire and, as far as I'm aware, we don't want it back.

You need good trade relations Mr Somali, so do we.",-0.167,275

"What a load of high level paternalistic twaddle from the BBC (surprise surprise!). Whilst it is right that Mugabe's time has come to an end, it is principally Britain that has systematically strangled the Zimbabwean people by imposing trade and economic sanctions on this agriculture and mineral exporting nation. Mugabe has is a convenient scapegoat when he stopped playing ball after his knighthood (attempting to buy him off to secure British interests in that country that started with the British South Africa Company in 1890 when Rhodes et al plundered the vast wealth of the nation and had continued to do so even post 1980 independence). 

Lift the sanctions imposed on Zimbabweans and stop this nonsense narrative that Mugabe is singularly responsible. British and EU sanctions are 90% of the problem. Mugabe's replacement will still have the same identical ethos that Zimbabwe's resources will never slavishly be a British empire plunderzone again. The work is still not yet done. Zimbabwe will be for Zimbabweans of colours and creeds.

So many people just trot out the same dictatorial nonsense, whilst avoiding the truth that the indigenization agenda in the Zim is what prompted Britain and the EU to strangle and murder the economy so that no other African leaders would get lofty ideas of doing the same - thereby threatening EU colonial interests and assets on the continent.

This is not a diatribe. Just keeping it real folks. Mugabe's biggest political errors include pretending that he was in fact the orchestrator and pioneering architect behind the land invasions. As the army have shown this week, he wasn't, but once the horse had bolted, he had to look like he was in charge. Historically he was always pragmatic so that wouldn't have come out of his playbook. His second biggest mistake was clearly Grace. Ironically, she has become a galvanizing and unwitting catalyst for change.
