"Awesome interview- honest, interesting and unexpectedly vulnerable. And it's lovely to see Cole being interviewed like the normal person he is, not a celebrity icon which is all just bullshit anyway. He seems a really interesting, beautiful person and this video portrayed that perfectly while talking about his passion and the always wonderful theme of art. The world, as Cole said, has become so isolated from reality through the mass media that vulnerability and honesty shown in others has become a rare and foreign gem. More videos like this need to be made, talking about real subjects in an authentic, non-commercialized environment. I will be subscribing🌼",0.9838,120

"I live Cole Sprouse and everything he said in this video but honestly the fact that he smokes is quite disappointing. Obviously I don’t know much about his personal life, and maybe it’s not a regular habit, but like I just don’t get why u would want to do it at all. Not trying to tell people how to live there lives but it was alil disappointing to see that",-0.4174,80

I love Cole so much so it kills me to see him smoke and damage himself. I know he is probably addicted and can't help himself but it just make me sad:(,-0.365,34

I love him so much,0.6369,5
I love how he just stars rolling weed just in the middle of questions I love that,0.8555,17
"I love how real he is now I love him even more, I want to find a creative outlet/ hobby for my depression and anxiety, I always thought photography, might give it a try <3",0.8858,39
"I love love love that he literally just sat there and rolled a joint and started smoking while the interview was going on, he's such a laid back and well spoken dud.",0.9287,34
I love that he’s so smart and like what an intellectual being. But smoking no plz Cole. No good 4 u. 😪,0.9268,27
I love the questions that you asked they were very insightful. Cole’s response was extremely helpful and very inspiring for any type of photographer. Awesome video overall! Just subscribed 😊,0.9411,35

I love when he just started rolling a blunt like okay cole,0.8225,12
I mean hes amazing and he’s right about pretty much anything but when u have such a great perspective and knowledge why smoke.. it’s bad for u and it’s literally burning money. He can do whatever he wants but that’s just my opinion (don’t comment hate shit on this),-0.7615,63
I must have watched this video at least 100 times by now. Love it! ❤️,0.6696,18
I needed this video it's great I love photography I just started and it really tells a story behind the picture I still need a lot of work but it's good,0.8402,31
I only had one mic and gave it to him. :(,-0.4404,12
"I rarely comment on Youtube videos but wow...such sincere, raw and emotional words. I feel very much alike regarding the feelings around photography and also about my own work. I don't know if you, Cole, read these comments, but it would be very inspiring to talk to you about this everything one day in person. I began also shooting when I was in an incredibly dark corner of my mind and it has been a form of escapism for me really. Here is my Instagram, in case there is a chance, you see my comment and are interested in having a longer talk around photography - https://www.instagram.com/juliashashkina/

"I'm an artist in the sense of drawing/painting, but I've always been interested in photography and it's really interesting to hear about Cole's journey and his views on his own work. I felt like I could really relate to him on the subject of criticism, because I myself will constantly look at art I've made and go ""...yeah, that could've gone better"". 
But as said, that's also a big factor in personal development and growth, as you're always trying to do better. -Though you know, it can be a big cause of anxiety and stress when you get to the point of feeling like you have no talent whatsoever- , but it's important to find that..balance.
This interview felt really genuine and natural, it's one of my favorites, I think. Just so..wholesome, in general ❤️",0.9747,161
