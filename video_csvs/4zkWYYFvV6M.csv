3 But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

4 In whom the god of this world (satan) hath BLINDED the MINDS of THEM which BELIEVE NOT, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, SHOULD SHINE unto them.

"I miss experiencing bagyo. As a kid I used to stuff rugs around our windows and doors because water getting into the house. I miss the candle light dinners(brownout). I miss the foods during typhoon. Idk why it’s so good eating when it’s raining or during a typhoon. And it’s always a common belief that it’s a good time to eat monggo when it’s raining. I miss the time when everyone in the house telling stories and having fun conversations due to no tv(brownout). I miss seeing the river behind my house getting wider and deeper. I miss listening to the radio station monitoring how’s  the typhoon doing. After the typhoon past, I missed playing outside. Seeing grown ups cleaning up fallen trees and debris. I love the seeing the Filipino spirit and nature of “bayanihan.” Typhoon just became part of us that we just smile and laugh about it. And just enjoy the experience. You almost miss a typhoon if it doesn’t come. At least that’s how I feel about typhoons. So enjoy and have fun Kulas. It’s such a full filing experience. Keep safe.",0.9741,232
