"14th of December : That date was the FCC's vote, now the repeal still has to go through Congress and they'll decide what to do then.

Congress made the Congressional Review Act which might help saved Net neutrality, so it's not too late to contact your representatives. Additionally, we just need about 5 Democrats and 1 Republican to sign the Congressional review Act to overturn FCC's repeal.

You should call your state senate to support the Congressional Review Act. If under 18, spread the word about the net neutrality issue with your friends/family/teachers.


If you cannot call, go to battleforthenet(.)com /scoreboard / shows whose for or against net neutrality. You hover over the pics/icon & can send them a tweet instead. If you have twitter

We have have about 28-27 days since this comment to still be able to somehow save net neutrality.",0.886,167
