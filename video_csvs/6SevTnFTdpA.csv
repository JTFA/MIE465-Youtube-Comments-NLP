"+metromartian 6 Fumagali only looks good because you don't have a good WR corp. When a TE is your leading receiver, your WRs must not be that good. The simple fact is that Ohio State is the best team you faced all season and you fell short. You were lucky not to have faced Ohio State and Penn State during the regular season. Who cares about your supposedly missed pass interference? You were already flagged for holding on that play so even if you got that call, it wouldn't have gained you anything. They just would have replayed the down. After the holding call, Hornibrook threw 3 straight incomplete passes. That's not the ref's fault. The refs also didn't cause Hornibrook to make a poorly overthrown ball that got picked off with a minute left. Good luck against Miami. You'll need it.",0.9771,158

"Anthony Machingo i don't disagree with the wr hands. It also has been disappointing. The only thing I can say about his stats are due to a huge amount of them are against lesser teams. He has had some big stat games against top teams but it wasn't very often. His legs are his bread and butter and it has got ohio state out of tight games but going up against tough defenses or team just as talented, he has been lacking.

"Daniel Lee I went to this game above. It was disappointing the effort given at certain periods. They booed JT cause he threw it away, but he couldn't do anything else because the WR stopped. In reality they should have let him throw more in 2015. Like more. Cause he was accurate. I noticed that by the end of 2016 he was broken physically and mentally. He kept getting sacked. Go look at the tape, at the beginning of 2016 he was still throwing great and on target a lot. But then he started getting hit like David Carr on the Texans and he couldn't handle it for some reason. He just didn't throw the same. But then this year when they protected him better he threw more accurately. And he does score more TDS against lower level talent. Which is true, but who doesn't. JT has dealt with some of the toughest schedules since he's been at OSU. Specifically last year where it felt like every game was primetime and they were facing the no2 team in the nation.",0.9787,199
"Daniel Lee That isn't the actual reason. He handicaps the pass game. Fair point. Counter argument. Have you ever considered that none of them can catch. Urban recruits fast players. Fast doesn't equal hands. How many passes has Parris Campbell dropped. How many has the rest of the team dropped. You can't blame a drop on a QB. You just can't. JT also had his best year. Iowa nobody showed up. The defense gave up 55. Okay. Your not gonna win if you give up 55 in Big Ten play. Alright. Big 12 you'll get away with it. Not the Big Ten. That being said he didn't play great by any means, but by no means did he lose them the game. Against OU the Buckeyes had NO offensive identity. Which cost them. They hadn't discovered the RPO yet and whenever JT did throw a good pass it got dropped. Austin Mack was probably the only reliable target all season, hands wise. 


Now. JT has stats. Do you know how hard it is to get those stats? And by the way he had his best game against the no2 team in the nation. And when I say best game I mean of his career. He set multiple records that day. He shattered records in a conference that's over 100 years old. Drew Brees held the records before him. Drew Brees is one of the greatest QBS ever on both the college and pro level. JT did things unimaginable and won the Buckeyes games by himself. Do I need to mention the time he piggybacked the offense against Wisconsin in 2016. It wasn't Curtis or Mike that game. No JT made plays with his arms and legs. He had that deep shot to Dontre which was answered and got them to the red zone and he punched it in multiple times. Plus he had the game winner. Or that time he was let down by his teammate against PSU in 2016. Where they dropped the ball off of a perfect pass and missed PI on the defense. And the special teams collapse. 2015 MSU was bad play calling. 2014 V Tech was his first big game and was also hid 2nd game ever as the starter. Clemson last year was awful for the same reasons Iowa was awful. They didn't show up. Nobody did. Any drive that was promising got killed by a fumble from Webber or a missed kick by Durbin. The games he's played bad by hid standards, like TTUN in 2016 people forget to mention that he sparked the offense and lit a fire in them to score and fight back.",-0.9383,495

"Hunter Jenkins I do believe it comes down to consistency. The committee made the correct decision in picking Bama over OSU for #4. You just can't lose by 31 points to an unranked Iowa team and have another loss to Oklahoma and expect to be in the playoffs over an Alabama team that stayed at the top ALL year and only has one loss and it was to Auburn, possibly the biggest rivalry in college football, at Jordan-Haire stadium. It just don't work like that. Now these last two games that Bama has played was horrific but not as horrific as OSU losing to Iowa. I'm a Bama fan of 42 years, but I'm also a realist, and I'm gonna say this: Bama better be getting prepared because Dabo and company will bring it. I believe that Saban needs to put Tua in the game against Clemson, for at least a quarter or so, not only for experience in ""big games"" but if he don't play Tua and Alabama loses to Clemson, Tua could very well want to transfer being that he could start anywhere in the country right now. Plus we need completions to win and hurts has shown us that he is basically all legs, and wouldn't have them if it wasn't for his offensive linemen. I know how Saban is though, he won't bench Jalen but damn man if he can't make a completion he needs pass the torch. Don't get me wrong now, I support Nick Saban and his final decisions on game day but he is only human and makes mistakes like us all. I say play Tua at least a quarter to see if he can move the ball (by arm) which in turn will motivate Hurts to play better. You have two awesome qbs at your disposal,  use them both. Don't want to lose Tua to a transfer, so play him so he can have experience in loud environments and keep him in your roster. That's my view on the situation. Stay blessed and ROLL TIDE",0.9162,375

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

"jazzalex22 You have to be trolling. OSU would've won this game by 4 touchdowns if JT was healthy. He overthrew 3 separate receivers that were wide open for scores and gifted you a pick 6. If it weren't for turnovers and penalties that went AGAINST us, you would've been shutout just like in 2014. You should be thankful you didn't get embarrassed again, because OSU is a far superior football team.",0.963,79

"what was most frustrating is when JT throws decent passes and his receivers forget how to catch. At a certain point they just gave up on the pass, much like how Wisconsin gave up on the run. Second half was a defensive game, and I thought Wisconsin would rally but they got shut down on the last drive. Ohio State likes to be wishy washy until it really matters then they turn on the heat. Not the most graceful win but nice to see how happy they all were, especially JT, for the ceremony. I wish they played the second half the same as the first half, we would have won by 28 easily.",0.9927,125
xBacon Grizzler69 no true. Ohio State last year had 3 top ten wins. Penn state had 1. This year Ohio state has more top 25 wins than Penn State again. Penn State didn't deserve last year but neither did OSU.,0.7003,46
