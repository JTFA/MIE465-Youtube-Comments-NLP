We think we know what happens, but we really just have good guesses that match up with what actually happens.

"Alright at a very very rough level:

Pretty much none of the statistics cited in this entire series adjusted for family size - ""inequality is going up"" shifts in family size explain much of this. 
Pretty much none of the statistics cited adjust for intelligence. I saw no attempt to adjust economic or health outcomes by a person's IQ (or SAT score). No attempt to account for how IQ might impact lifespans (hint not dying is helped by intelligence). If you don't like IQ or SAT substitute in your own measurement for intelligence. The same can be said for parental factors - and this matters as mating has been increasingly assortive in the last few decades.
None of the statistics on wage gaps cited in this series adjusted for... IQ, college major, field entered, years of experience... the list goes on. 


OLS regression or logistic regression could handle much of this. Using more sophisticated models such as GBM, neural nets or random forests could filter out some of that noise to give more accurate estimates if you look at partial differential plots for a given variable of interest.


Statistical methods aren't perfect but it's a lot more accurate than segmenting data and declaring that the mean of each segment tells the whole story (and implicitly assuming that differences in each group aren't caused by lurking variables).",0.8113,251

"Right, and that appears (emphasis on appears) to be a valid approach. If you had taken courses later in the Sociology coursework, you could see the types of statistical methods they use to try to parse their observations. In this particular video they link resources with all kinds of statistics on age. It's easier to know when someone was born and what age people die all over the world, but how can one measure a racist or sexist attitude with math?

In those cases they have to have proxies, like how often people of a 'race' or ethnic group get hired. They can run these studies effectively by removing names and seeing which résumés get picked and who doesn't. When names are removed, any given candidate with an equally strong resume has a roughly equal chance of being hired, but when compared to résumés with a feminine or 'black sounding' name, their chances drop. How does one measure that and what units do they use? Are the recruiters 33 racist? The fact is people hire applicants they feel most similar to or people similar to those in the company with a good reputation. That can't really be modeled.

What Sociologists can do is draw comparative studies between countries, states, cities, companies, or anything with a similar makeup. Experiments are prohibitive because one can't found a country with equal natural resources and designate one to be patriarchal and the other matriarchal. If one tries to model that, it would definitely be biased depending on the information you feed into the algorithm. Don't forget that people have to create the algorithms and if they use data that was collected with biased methods, that same bias will be codified.",0.8747,320

"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!

JESUS LOVES YOU!
He is not angry at you, The Lord actually died and rose again so that WE may live! Hallelujah!
Thank You, Jesus!

So friends, if you do not know Jesus, please make Him Lord of your life today. You do not need a fancy prayer to do this, all you need is your heart and faith. Simply ask Him to help you and save you, and you will be.
This is all I did, and The Lord literally has changed my life!
The Lord is SO Good, friends!

Judgement is coming so quickly, and The Lord made a WAY to escape - that Way is JESUS!
He took our punishment on the cross! Thank You, Jesus!
So please make this moment to call upon Jesus, and YOU WILL be saved. If you ask for forgiveness, you will be forgiven!
Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so don't be afraid to seek Him!

To die without Jesus is *VERY DANGEROUS!*
So please make the wisest decision of your life by calling to Jesus while you still can!

Shalom, friends.",0.9903,231
"The Netherlands already has a party that wants socialism for old people. Just old people. No one else. It's called 50PLUS. They oppose the recently raised retirement age, and all that stuff, expecting to be supported for a third of their lives. It's unfeasible. The original retirement age was devised back when you'd live for a few more years in your retirement, and then drop dead.",-0.3182,76
"The course I took WAS an upper level sociology course. Nearly the easiest A+ I ever got.


I have a friend who studied sociology at a top university. 
She is not familiar with the mathematical underpinnings of A LOT of different statistical methods. 

If you had taken more advanced, upper level, mathematics, statistics, econometrics and/or computer science courses (formally or informally) you'd see that most sociological instruction is SORELY lacking in terms of quantitative methods. 

Most of the ""statistics"" cited in these videos are based on univariate analysis. They're sums and averages. No mention of even ANOVA or linear regression. 
No mention of using more sophisticated models and then generation partial differential plots. 

No mention of mathematical assumptions. AT ALL. This is wrong. It's dishonest. Using univariate analysis assumes that all other background factors are equal across populations. The mathematics used literally assumes no diversity. 

The mathematics used in many sociological studies literally assumes no diversity. Think about that.",-0.4242,187
"The reason agism isn't studied as much is that it is very limited if not non-existent. Sure, you might have the odd old person saying ""all you millennials are so entitled"" or ""back in my day"" etc. But in the long run it doesn't really affect anyone's quality of life apart from the fact that baby boomers mightn't have had as much stuff as millennials, which is uncontrollable. As a society we treat different ages differently which is just. You might say ""it's so agist that the silent generation doesn't have to work"" but that's because they've already worked and are mostly too old to carry on.

Also, the concept of generations is ridiculous. For example, someone born in 1966 and someone born in 63 have closer life experiences and are closer in age than someone born in 1964 and someone in 46, but strangely the latter example are considered one generation and the former different. One very good example of this is me and my brothers. My oldest was born in 1993, counting him as a millennial, and my next oldest was born in 97 making him an igen/gen z like me when i was born in 2003. my two older brothers have closer life experiences than i do with my second oldest brother (for example both of their first phones were flip ups and not touch screen when mine was touch screen, and they grew up watching the same TV shows, I hardly ever watch TV because of YouTube) but are considered different generations when me and my second oldest bro are the same. It's ludicrous and generations are social constructs.",-0.3648,303
The social connections to it certainly are. People of 12-14 years old used to be considered mature enough for marriage (or to rule a kingdom). Now they can't consent to sexual activity or medical procedures in most Western nations.,0.5475,44

This really should be in biology and psyhcology based on what you breifed. The more I look at your sociology look at age and aging the less I see the actual study and the more I see psychological and biological. This feels like an unneeded science as there already enough branches of study that delve into this stuff. It's already enough that math split off science for no other reason than to isolate the equations for further understanding and evaluation. Which is stupid. Science is literally the real life examples necessary for a student to understand truly the logic behind the equations. At least in chem class and everyday cooking you know what these conversions are good for. In math they mean diddly squat.,0.2263,132

"Well this is the crux of the problem, right? They may or may not be motivated to find a result, but most critics are incapable of fully understanding the statistics or specialized vocabulary. For example, in their video on gender they used the term as a sociologist would and not as a layperson would and didn't do an adequate job of defining it. In that case, if it ""feels"" wrong for the critic, they automatically call it invalid without truly understanding the argument.
