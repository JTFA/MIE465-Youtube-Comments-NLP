"Music is influenced by music. Until science and technology advances so much that new sounds, instruments, chords, and styles can be created, every single song you hear is gonna sound like something else. If you don't like one sound, it doesn't make others bad, cliche, or unoriginal, especially because music is also influenced by experience and emotion, and can be incredibly important to someone. Btw, making other people feel bad because it makes you feel better about yourself makes you a shitty person.",0.902,97

"[Verse 1]
I hate it when dudes try to chase me
But I love it when you try to save me
'Cause I'm just a lady
I love it when we play 1950
It's so cold that your stare's 'bout to kill me
I'm surprised when you kiss me

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me why my gods look like you
And tell me why it's wrong

[Chorus]
So I'll wait for you, I'll pray
I will keep on waiting for your love
For you, I'll wait
I will keep on waiting for your

[Verse 2]
Did you mean it when you said I was pretty?
That you didn't wanna live in a city
Where the people are shitty?
I like it when we play 1950
So bold, make them know that you're with me
Stone cold, will you miss me?

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me why my gods look like you
And tell me why it's wrong

[Chorus]
So I'll wait for you, I'll pray
I will keep on waiting for your love
For you, I'll wait
I will keep on waiting for your

[Bridge]
I hope that you're happy with me in your life
I hope that you won't slip away in the night
I hope that you're happy with me in your life
I hope that you won't slip away
I hate it when dudes try to chase me
I love it when you try to save me
'Cause I'm just a lady

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me why my gods look like you
And tell me why it's wrong

[Chorus]
So I'll wait for you, I'll pray
I will keep on waiting for your love
(For your love, for your love, for your love)
For you, I'll wait
I will keep on waiting for your",0.9962,331
