"Hey Samantha! So i have a question. My mum is planing to change her wardrobe to something more elegant and I hope you can help me. She is really small and she has some (not to much but some) extra kg. She is a nurse and does a lot of lifting so her arms are quite big. It's really hard for her to find good clothes. If anyone has any tips or knows like a good online site with tips or anything I will be so grateful if you share them. Also, excuse my english, it's not my first language",0.9747,111
