"AB should have ditched the ridiculous Bud Light Knight ‚ÄúDilly Dilly‚Äù commercials and ran this spot instead. The Clydesdale are iconic and as such, folks really look forward to seeing them during the SB as representations of a positive, confident America. They are America! Seriously, what madness must have overcame the executives during the AB decision making process compelling them to choose ‚ÄúDilly Dilly‚Äù (read: ‚Äúdumb dumb!‚Äù) over the beautiful AB horses? OUR horses?! All AB execs involved in this decision should be drug tested on the spot - there simply is no other explanation for such an obvious gaffe! Shame, AB! Shame!!",-0.5312,127
"Actually, getting a line clamped under the tail dock can compromise control of a team, leading to runaways and horrific, even fatal crashes.

Most draft horses are docked as foals.  I think it's most often done with elastic bands these days, similar to what we use to steer bull calves.  Bloodless and painless.  

The draft horses we've bought were all docked.  The ones born here are not, because we're in the South, where they really need their complete tails to fight bugs.  And we rarely drive more than a pair, which makes it far easier to manage the lines than with the six and eight-up hitches.",-0.7579,120

Briar Lee Mitchell ok I‚Äôm sorry but like 99% if draft horses tails are docked so they don‚Äôt get tangled in the reins or straps! It doesn‚Äôt hurt when they do it because the horse is knocked out and they take very good care of their horses!,0.8655,56

"Can you please direct your energy to the horses being rounded up for slaughter from idiot owners who abandon them, sell them, starve them, etc? The 'Bud Clydes are some of the best cared for horses on this planet - meanwhile you pour your heard out on them instead of the animals that could really use some help?

"This is so sickening...so tired of seeing what Budweiser does to those beautiful horses. What most people don't realize, is that, Budweiser mutilates them ...when they are babies, they hack their tails off.

Why did Budweiser take the regular Seagram's Escapes off the shelves and add the Spiked kind. I like feeling good and not wanting to get drunk. If I wanted to get drunk I would go to the liquor store and not taste like the Spiked. Spiked is nasty.  Just lost a customer.,0.3818,57
