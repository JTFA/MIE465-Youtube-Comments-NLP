Get your facts straight. The literacy rate in India when British left was below 2%. High English literacy rate in India is not because of them.

"As an Indian I say India's curse is it does not have a Himalaya type mountain in North-West border, to prevent invaders from attacking, which allowed all invaders to come including the Muslims who converted a large number of Indians and very existence of Pakistan and Bangladesh is its result. Historically to protect India from foreign invasion, we needed to keep Eastern Afghanistan, Kabul and Kandahar under our rule, Mauryan Empire and Mughal Empire did that. But since India got partitioned in 1947 the whole scenario changed. India first felt threatened from North in late 1800s as Tsarist Russia was spreading its influence in Tibet. After Chinese capture of Tibet for the first time Gangetic plains, India's heartland felt threatened.

The individual kingdoms existed inside the Mauryan empire aka India, which Chandragupta allowed provided that the individual kings acknowledge the Mauryans as the emperor of the empire inside which the individual kingdoms exist. Ashoka who was the mighty king of the Mauryan empire and Chandragupta's grandson is honored by his Chakra called Ashok Chakra in the Indian flag.

It's unity as a country is un-natural because there is very less that is similar between the south and the north, East and the western India to be a single country.

"India's geography is really good, not a problem. The variety of geographic structures  within the subcontinent is brilliant. The subcontinent ranges from tropical to temperate climates. The geography has everything from high mountain ranges to deserts to mangroves. Maybe these features seem to isolate the area but historically India was an important trade center, with abundance of natural resources. India traded with other far away lands by sea and by road, including trade with China for silk and porcelain, and other places like Ceylon (Sri Lanka) by sea. Yes, India wasn't a single nation, but a land made up of smaller provinces and kingdoms that were satisfied with the land and the recourses they had. The Indian population in general was a United one in terms of religion before the British realised it would be really easy if they could just divide and rule. The British succeeded and then lack of unity in terms of religion started.  They ruled India for around 200 years, which isn't a short time period. Unfortunately only the ones who studied in schools with the British system of education were considered literate, while India had its own old school system, which unfortunately has died out over the past couple of centuries. So now we really have a problem with literacy. Indians were divided based on sects or working classes. Also, the British didn't want to unite the different regions of India by building railway, they built infrastructure for their own convenience. Even the Indo-Pak border was drawn so that they could make each new country believe that they're the victims of this war from the other side, and the British could reap benefits from the situation.
The reason why India is still a developing country cannot be pointed out as one. Yes, the British played and important role, but so does the corruption, the mistrust amongst the people, the divide and rule, and now the lack of formal education access in every corner of the country. But whatever the reasons are, geography definitely isn't one.",0.9703,378

but even after all this, u still gave independence to 562 princely states and told them not to be part of indian union. THIS IS THE LEGACY OF YOUR EMPIRE. and all the law are written by INDIANS themselves adapting from 5 different countries

today indians have nothing but pure hatred towards your genocidal empire, your media and your small island country. Not even our leaders are interested in doing business with uk. Soon we are planning to secede from useless commonwealth",-0.6134,203

India was always united, we had many rulers (king) but was united through a single idea (Dharma & Karma)... in our tradition many ideas can co-exits that is why India is diverse, when British conquered  India it tried to fit the western template (Central authority & one idea fits all) in India and destroy the traditional education system and the consequence we still face today....",0.9489,210

"Wonder, not problem! The stupendous, splendid ancient culture was safe in its growth because of the protection of geography through millennia, until about 700 A.D.. 


As for ""technological advancements"" elsewhere, they followed modern industrial era which was also the colonial centurues, which had India open to the said advance due to Europe's adventures. india was, until then, far more advanced. 


India not being a country before Brits came is a convenient myth; britush isles werent a country, when Roman empire was trampling it, or Viking marauders looted. Identity of either, however, was never in question, else the very name would be non existent. It isn't always political union that's of paramount importance, but that of a land's people via culture and trade, and more. 


Number of major religions in India is more than counted here in video, unless all Indic religions are counted as one, which is ok. Diversity of every other sort in India is more than that in Europe. 

As for the so called two nation theory, which proved false in '71 by splitting of the so called religion based nation, that theory was pushed by British as per Macaulay policy to break up India for interests of Brits rule, and it was a British minor officer who invited and pushed the then unwilling Muslims to form a separate political party after congress had been formed. Partition was just as much planned by UK - the day soviet tanks rolled into berlin ahead of UK and U.S. forces in WWII- and pushed on the unwilling citizens in what is now finally pak, for UK and US convenience of military bases for use against USSR. The votes in punjab were for unionist party, and in NWFP they were strongly in favour of India, so much so most abstained in protest against being forced to vote about partition. 

The video seems to be made to order to suit some anti Indian interests. Notice how India's advances last few decades are attributed to ""English language"", instead of the competence in intelligence and intellectual fields in general, science and technology in particular. The video credits the British empire for this advance tiday. This fraud is obviius, since the British empire included not only whole of India but far more around the world, famously summed up as the empire sun never set on. Yet it's been only India that went ahead with the technological revolution that was internet. Thisobviously indicates the minimal part that the language and empire plays in the recent developments. 

When constantly comparing India and China, the video harps on equality in China and inequality in India, but forgets to mention the genocide in tens of millions in China that its regime perpetrated post communist rule brought in after WWII, chiefly targeting the intelligentsia, while India had a democracy from the very beginning and still working - as evidenced often enough since '77. The progress and economy of India has to be seen on thus background of a democracy that functions with diversity larger than Europe in every respect and a population three times thst of US but with its diversity intact - a salad bowl, or a thali with over dozens of individual items, rather than a brown melt in pot, to rephrase a pet phrase of US. 

The British did build roads and railways, but this video credits them for doing thus to build India as a nation. They had to do it for the same reason Germany had autobahns in thirties, which was, to move troops, which britush in India needed to control rather than develop the nation of India. Britush were in India to loot and enrich the Brits, as are any colonial regimes anywhere, at expense of the locals treated as subject of slavery in all but name. Any benefits from education to administration to roads etc were strictly designed for British interests. 

Re states in India, the video gets borderline absurd and atrocious. States dividing nation for administration purposes exist in well over half a dozen countries, if not four times that, and who is to decide whether they must follow straight lines as in US and Canada, or erstwhile independent kingdoms as in Germany? That India chose languages as one criteria isn't a reason to put India down (a la imposition of one language, one script, one church, one book, by Roman empire for example, or inquisition by church wiping ou all dissent and nipping progress in bud until renaissance for that matter), but a reason to celebrate the diversity and its value. Admit it, pak broke because it's diversity was not accepted by the racist doctrine allowed, nay, celebrated, by its regime.",0.994,876

"You have so many misconceptions about India: for example, you said India wouldn't have been a single country if it wasn't for the British. This statement is categorically wrong: It fails to take into account previous rules who unified much of India such as the Maurya empire. By the time the British hardened their grip, the people of India, even though ruled by different kings, considered themselves unified. This is because of the common roots in the culture.
You said the Britishers benefited the India economy. This is the stupidest statement I have ever heard. Your statements seem to be coming out of your ass. India contributed to 25% of all of the world's GDP when the Britishers came. In fact, they got there in the first place because the economy seemed so lucrative. The Britishers systematically destroyed all of the India's economy, starting from textile industry to agriculture, taking away peoples food and causing widespread famines.

"yes,the british were foreign invaders who were exploiting the Indian people,but that was going to happen anyways. With the differences in society and culture,the land we call today as India,was ripe for any foreign invasion. Thankfully it was the british,who also brought along with them western technologies and western education. 

Only they had the strength to unite the whole of the peninsula under one name. Granted,it was nothing ideal,the hate and problems with neighbours India has,is the result of the British raj sowing the seed of hatred among some communities of India. But the people of India at that time have an equal share in guilt and shame. 

If the British raj had not invaded the subcontinent,you would be looking at a mini Africa,with the current states being individual countries,each one siding with one of the superpowers in the cold war and the Indian peninsula becoming a very heated front for the proxy wars between USA and USSR.

Just putting something as complex and long winded in one sentence of : ""British destroyed and looted"" is incorrect and nothing short of a crime in itself. You may cherry pick on what parts of history you want to remember,but that wont change what happened. If you don't wanna take my word for it,watch more videos like this one,where he talks on how the Western culture and education helped India in becoming one of the biggest economies of the world today. Without them,you would be looking at even more border problems,as there would have been way more independent countries,and no one would have been strong enough on their own.",-0.8145,314
