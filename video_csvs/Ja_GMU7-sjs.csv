"Chrome and Android
  Although Android can run on netbooks, Chrome OS is being developed as a separate project. Android is designed for running phones and phone systems. It's not really designed for use on computers. Chrome OS is designed for computers rather than phones.
   To further confuse this distinction, there are rumors that Chrome is indeed destined to become a tablet OS. Netbook sales have been eroding as full-size laptops become cheaper and tablet computers like the iPad become more popular.  However, iPads have declined in popularity in American schools while Chromebooks have gained popularity in schools the price.",0.9099,109

"I bought this Laptop shortly after the holidays with the intent on making it my mainstay machine for work (and personal use etc.) I was happy with my old Lenovo (at the time) but the motherboard died on me and the cost of replacing it wasn't worth the value of the computer yada yada yada (we've all been there).

I'll begin by saying that I have prior experience with a chromebook having owned an acer chrome computer so this is not my first rodeo using Chrome OS.

Out of the box immediately I could tell that this is easily the most well-built machine I have ever laid my hands on. It looks and feels amazing. 

Basically Google nailed the 2-1 (I like Marques but he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about this time around - there's nothing weird about how comfortable this Pixelbook looks and feels); whether you're in tablet mode or in a laptop position it just feels brilliant. The keyboard is crisp and responsive so typing 90 words a minute laying on your back is actually made possible. In tablet mode with the pen things are a bit more relaxed and slower-paced but with google voice you can dictate an entire essay in one go if you want - the processor is powerful on this thing so expect no delays. 

Speaking of using your voice - the ""Google button"" is friggen awesome. I find myself using it constantly even if I'm in the middle of engaging wth a  Google Play app and/or Chrome app - it works seamlessly and its response time is quick. For the record I love the idea that Google is implementing this feauture more in its hardware designs because tech is headed towards a more voice-activated world to the point where I think keyboards will be a thing of the past and this laptop has made a huge step in that direction.

One thing that is simply amazing is when splitting screens to an external monitor I can use Android apps on the external screen and have regular Chrome programs running on the home screen which is an excellent feature for multitasking.

After saying all that I discovered that with my new profession I'm not able to get around not being able to use Adobe - off-market PDF software won't cut it which unfortunately means I'm having to return the device and buy a PC laptop instead (which kills me because I love the Pixelbook but no Adobe Acrobat Pro for Chrome has turned into a deal breaker).

All-in-all this is a fantastic computer that will set the stage for Chromebooks going forward. Forget all the previous chromebooks you've seen before - THIS is the new flagship hardware that will get people thinking about making that switch to a more simplified OS existence.

All we need now is software providers like Adobe to start making deals with Google so we can start divorcing microsoft from our lives completely for those among us that don't want to have anything to do with either Microsoft OR Apple for that matter.",0.995,546

And having it flipped to tablet with a keyboard on the back that would feel strange to me too. Besides it doesn't justify the pricetag. It's still premium device with an advanced browser on it.

You are a biased pro-apple user. You can not say ""in my opinion"" compared to apple this or apple that.

"The iPhone succeeded because it defined a smartphone and made touch screen keyboards work more efficiently than buttons. The google pixel book offers nothing innovative like that, it’s a clone of the surface pro, but worse because of the chrome OS limitations. Chrome OS belongs on mobile devices like cellphones. It has no use on a laptop, and how can you defend this after seeing the pencil they provide? It’s some unnatural stylus that doesn’t work at all like MS or apple pens. It was just plastered on the chrome book to make it seem like they can compete. This is just a failure in all definitions of the word.

"i love 2in1's, functionality and power of laptop with size and portability of tablet.  i don't game or anything like that, so don't need full laptop type power.  and don't travel with it so don't need tiny tablet.  of the few i've used, surface is by far the best.  if i didn't need a machine to run actual programs or need to do any actual stuff beyond basic mobile stuff, i'd prob use an ipad.  but for productivity and versatility, surface is spot on.  can't justify these mobile tablets seeing as they're just big phones, no idea how someone could justify a mobile laptop.  but there's a market for everything i guess.",0.4854,128
