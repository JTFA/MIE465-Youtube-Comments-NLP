Sadly I didn't really design it for SLA printing & it couldn't transform, plus some parts were too small & broke.

"Hey! Glad to get a reply from you! I run two Form 2 printers all day every day and i find them so be incredibly consistent.

-The support from formlabs (the producer) is also top notch with quick response and thorough trouble shooting. Th

-The ecosystem of the Form 2 from the preform software to the cleaning products for finishing are phenomenal.

-Cost is a bit hgher

-Vats, while high quality, last not very long

Sure, if you print something that's relatively thin, there's a high probability that it will shatter if you hit it hard enough, but if you put some thought in to the construction, and use the right resin, you can end up with extremely robust parts. I've seen some resin prints run over by a car and not break. Not all resins are equal. Some have pure hardness, some have flexibility, others have strength due to the right mix of hardness and flex. I wouldn't waste my time typing out stuff like this to inform people if I'd  not personally witnessed these things for myself.",0.8745,138

"I have about 1300 hours of print time on a DLP resin printer. Yes, it can be messy, but only if YOU are messy!You don't have to spend hundreds on a bath or curing station either.  I use a simple Tupperware container with alcohol and a soft paintbrush to remove uncured resin, then I blast it with alcohol and then dry with an airbrush. I then put it under a homemade curing chamber that I made with a small bucket and a strip of UV LED's. I set it on a little ""solar"" rotating display stand inside and most things cure perfectly in 10-15 minutes. It's really not as bad, nor is it nearly as expensive, as some people make it out to be. The greatest cost is the resin and, in my case, the vat film, or in the Moai's case, the resin vats that cost $55 each and wear-out quickly. Like I said, I have a LOT of printing time on my DLP printer, and have made well over 500 miniatures. I have also made scale model parts and even complete scale model ""kits"". It is a FANTASTIC hobby!",0.9858,219
I have been interested in SLA printer but the one thing that doesn't get mentioned is how long is the shelf life of the resin?

Cause there are times that for weeks I never touch my 3d printer.,0.4678,71

I have the Form 2 the Moai and a D7. What your paying for with the Form 2 is a complete ecosystem. Everything from the resins to the slicer are meant to help guarantee a successful print. All resin tanks are consumable as the light passing though the bottom and print curing on the surface of them degrades the plastic. The form 2 is a package that works very very well if you don't want to mess with learning curing and burn in times. The Form 2 and Moai both deliver excellent results it's just how easy it is to get there. The Form 2 is like a luxury car as it has bells and whistles that you don't need but are nice to have. The Moai is great for the price if you don't mind being a little more hands on and don't mind not having dedicated software. I prefer the Form 2 but when you factor in price the Moai is a MUCH better value especially since your not locked into their resins. For me it comes down to the software and parts availability.,0.967,196
"I have to disagree with you here. I have a DLP printer (Gizmo3d) and I can print at around 3-4mm/min, and that's without the super speed add on. DLP tends to be faster because it displays an entire layer all at once, rather than  having to have a tiny point run around touching every point of the layer. Of course, times will vary depending on your resin, and the power of the light source (whether it be laser or projector) but most of the time, DLP will tend to be quicker.",-0.4354,108

Simmarith but that‚Äôs not the case any more. There are resins stronger or equal to ABS and you don‚Äôt have weakness at layers like FDM. A FDM print is always weakest at its layer lines,-0.3612,41
Simmarith don't want that because printing a large object would cost to much or don't want to bond using the same material because of cost. I don't get it. Wouldn't take much to bond 2 layers together could probably even dip the surfaces in the vat and then stick the two parts together and uv cure. Not to mention that this printer is open to using other companies resins and you could shop for the more cost effective.

It doesn't have any kind of chemical/alcohol type burn in your nose when you smell it. Personally the smell of the resin I have atm doesn't bother me at all, but I guess it depends on each person and maybe the sensitivity of their nose?
With printers like this Moai, the D7, Photon etc, simply putting the cover on/closing the system up should be enough to trap most, if not all of the smell inside.",0.6222,156

"This! As long as you keep it away from UV light, it should last a long time.

I wonder if theres a way to calculate the total volume of a completed helmet to the amount of resin it would require to make it. to say all in all this helmet would cost x amount to print 60 70$. My brother just printed an entire helmet on his cr-10 printer and it took a whole roll of filament start to finish so it was about a 30$ helmet in materials. not bad. obviously sla is more expensive but i wonder just how much more expensive. If you could print a whole helmet for like under 100$ and not need all the finish work that a fdm type printer requires to make look nice. Because now to really make this helmet look nice i now need to glue all the parts together. fill the gaps, sand it all down quite a bit, epoxy coat the surface. sand again. and paint if we dont inbed metal powder in the epoxy and that adds a bit more time and money as well. i dont think sla would end up cheaper by any means i just wonder if it could be reasonable at some point to print the parts to a helmet bond them and you have a really really nice helmet with very little post process.   pipe dream but itll probably happen soon. i mean printers have come super far since we first started printing.",0.9831,281
