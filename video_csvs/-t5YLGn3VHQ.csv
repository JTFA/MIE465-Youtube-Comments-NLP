I'm having a blast with the game even with technical issues.

obviously the PC version shown and right at the end tiny text describing the preview program. keep on doing what you do best microsoft.,0.6369,26
oof The PC version got out of their own preview version yesterday and was changed to ver 1. The game has been out for a while on pc and they're still working on it. I wouldn't wait too long because Ark did the same thing. It used to be $20 in the preview phase and now its a full $60,0.0,65
