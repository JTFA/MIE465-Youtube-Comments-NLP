He was never a good team-mate, and never made anyone better. At this point in his career he could be a role-player for a title contender, but that's about it.  If the Thunder management is strategic they will trade PG for a few key pieces while he still has value and before other teams realize he's over-rated just like Pacers fans were seeing the last few years.  They should get pieces to help Westbrook and Adams ,and keep Melo for the dangerous shooting.  The problem is, Westbrook doesn't usually play well with others, but they can't trade Westbrook and for a small market shouldn't, so they should get two players for PG at least, another good power-forward and another role-playing skilled guard to help take pressure off Westbrook.",-0.934,178

Westbrook will never win I swear the dude is counting his stats like it's 2k or something I used to like him but literally every player that left is doing better he's shooting below 40% can you imagine the hate harden would have if he was struggling like this right now but for some reason everyone gives Westbrook a pass,-0.276,61

"When I made a statement that Melo can never mix with superstars just as he did with Iverson in the past, everyone made fun of me.
Now what? Melo is all about ""ME ME ME"".  
The reason Melo plays really bad in OKC is because he is not the main guy anymore.  It is Westbrook's team.
Remember when Iverson was with Melo?  It was Melo's team back then.
I knew Melo would fail by join someone else's team, and I am glad he did not join LeBron when everyone said they should trade Melo for Love.  It is not going to work.",0.8388,115

"Yes, Carmelo can shoot and score from anywhere on the court. No, his defense is not up to par with most starters. Those we can see on stat boxes. 
The question we need answered is, will Carmelo ever play with heart?
Will Carmelo... get the hunger to win at any cost? ...have the intensity to dive for the ball without thinking? ...have the heart to try and block a dunk he might get posterized in? ...ever ramp up his D to be a 2 way player? 
I haven't seen it in any capacity that defines him. He just doesn't bring the intangibles or the intensity to a game. It's ok though, not everyone was meant to to be main reason a team wins the championship. Just think of Carmelo as a better version of Robert Horry. So if he plays his cards right and becomes a role player... a 6th man... 3rd option... we might just get lucky enough to collect a couple of rings.

the problem is, play with no heart is contagious...",0.9444,200

You know that they draw straws before the show airs on which position they have to take.

"You‚Äôd be stupid to believe him... Carmelo is not willing to anything to help the team win! He laughed when they asked him about coming off the bench; if he‚Äôs missing shots and the coach wants to take him out, he refuses to leave the court! He is selfish and is one of the main reasons why OKC is 15-15 right now. Paul George is very admirable; he respects the coach, is willing to be more of a catch and shoot player and is willing to do whatever to help the team win. He is willing to move the ball around and get people involved. 
*BOTTOM LINE*
Carmelo needs to be traded.",0.9143,129

both Carmelo Anthony and Paul George are washed the hell up! I watch that game last night and it was even more pathetic in person then it  has been on TV the way those two guys do not move in the offense. how they freeze with ball in there hands like there waiting for the defender to suddenly fall down or something.   how neither can get the ball in the paint it's frustrating I feel sorry for Westbrook.  Sam presti traded all OKC's young Talent away for these two washed-up has-beens,-0.8475,95

"on the arguement smith wins but melo should be the one who will sacrifice. first of all all three of them are good at iso but i think melo is best at spotting. do you see how scary it is to make westbrooke handle the ball, paul and melo is wating for it. is just like good couching for me. i didnt say that westbrooke should take all the shots but I really at creating ball at hand george and paul should be the strongest cause melo is the strongest spot up shooter of the three. then it will decide if it is george and westbrooke. if iso(one on one from the three point line) westbrooke could take take shot but if westbrooke couldn't do that he must pass it to george and make him play. of course if decoy is in the two melo should do that. my personal opinion though, not really a coach, hehehe. known that play from experience of playing on videogame and watching at real basketball and what my basketball iq from watching it real life. I played basketball in my younger years I think I know basketball. And I hope I does hehe",0.9929,216
