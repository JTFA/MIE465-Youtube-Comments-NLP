"1:03 food idea: corn tortillas and Central America
I've been super fascinated with Central American culture and I met a group of women preserving the art of crushing corn and making tortillas and even got the chance to make one. (We were told that the best tortillas expanded like balloons during cooking.)  The food culture there is incredible and delicious.",0.9509,66
"2018

1. Write, read and draw a whole fucking lot. I have a book to write, and I want to start writing another. I feel I didn’t read enough last year so I have like twenty books bought for me to read. And drawing because I’ve always wanted to be a good artist, so I bought sketchbook for the year to observe my improvement. Most of that will occur over the summer.

2. Get better at things I’m already good at. Example: soccer 

3. Strive for more knowledge and to not keep everything to myself.",0.9297,115
"2018: I hope to push myself to do things that are hard but cause positive growth and change. 

One thing I've been trying to do more often is controlling my impulses, I always want to over indulge with: food, alcohol, and well, the biggest one is probably playing video games. I must find my personal balance.

I need to do things for myself and not let other peoples opinions stop me from risky, yet possibly amazing decisions.

Example: I loved high school, I loved learning, my teachers and all the opportunities that seemed to present themselves. But, I didn't go to university because my dad was telling me it was a bad investment, because I'd never get a job and I'd be in debt- so I went to trade school instead and blew a bunch of money on that and hated the course and never got a job in my field.  Now I'm in debt.
I ""failed"" the thing I didn't even want to do! I took the ""less risky"" route my dad wanted me to take, instead of following my own passion.  I failed before I even began.

I want to do things for myself, even if it's a risk!

Positive example: Recently  I just got back from a 3 month trip to Spain to meet my boyfriend I met online, and it turned out better than expected. But for the 4 months leading up to the trip, my family was telling me not to go. They wanted me to stay home and be safe; they kept telling me horror stories. Telling me it was a waste of money and I might not even like him.  My mom even tried to bribe me to stay by buying me a puppy.  I had an amazing time, loved him and his family so much, and I'm currently waiting until next month when he comes here to Canada to live with me!  

My point is- this kinda solidified to me that, if I'm passionate about doing something I should take the shot- the chance of failure is always gonna be there if I do or DONT try, but if its successful then wowowoow, I just did something great for myself that I actually deeply care about!

A huge problen is the anxiety and depression I get when I work.  I've only ever worked for big coporations and it always turns me into a hollow shell of a human. I get really really.. bad.  Lots of panic attacks, and well, a lot of ""wishing I didn't exist anymore thoughts"". My doctor and social assistance counselor told me to just ""get over it, join society, and take antidepressants if you need to"".  I know I feel like that because I'm not working in a place where I'm passionate about the work I'm doing, I'm not using any of my brainpower, I'm not doing what I want, I don't feel like I'm helping anyone- and essentially I feel like a  robot.

So maybe, what change I really need is a big one.  Something risky, but a thing I feel emotionally and intellectually connected to.  I want to go to university and- from that, find a career path that makes my heart sing.  I spend hours on youtube just learning (history, science, and psychology), and I want that to become apart of me, apart of what I do everyday and I want to have a career that involves what I love.

2018 and onward, I want to become who I've wanted to be since highschool. I want to take a chance that might make my life better than I could have imagined, and if I fail, then at least I'm right back where if started.",0.993,705

If you want something to cover, the whole French/English culture divide in Medieval England is interesting.  For example, did you know that Macaroni Cheese was a French invention and was introduced to England by King Richard II?  Speaking of him, his recipe book ""The Forme of Cury"" is probably the most extensive and complete collection of Medieval recipes we have.
You might want to check out BBC shows like The Sweet Makers (interesting discussion about confectionery ties with slavery), and Victorian Bakers (this esp. for the effect industrialisation had on bread supply in the 19th century).
Also, beware Roman recipes.  They can be very finicky.

"One goal for me: make my school’s computer lab warm, inviting, and user friendly.  

Your goals sound like they could be Hank goals; creating more, building on actionable ideas, doing a thing we can see. I feel similarly in that I have lots of ideas, but I’d like to actually make the time to make those ideas a reality. 

For example, I want to create a web space that organizes YouTube videos for teachers that looks good and makes sense. Many teachers are overwhelmed by the resources available and don’t have time to vet every video. This can have dicey outcomes. I’d initially make it for my site or my district and see what hAppens from there.",0.9319,140

do the oldest form of cooking known to man BEEF JERKY yep dried salted meat
