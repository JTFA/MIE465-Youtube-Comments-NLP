"Hey will smith I listened to your intro comments and it has sparked something in me this has been on my heart to share:) so I hope you like it and it touches you in some immeasurable great level deep inside.... ill be upfront bro I'm Christan I'll be more upfront and say that my motive is to just direct you or signal you to the direction that may help you... a Christan? Up to you... but something much deeper and real what you do from there is up to you...God?... Well we know what the world has seen about god through his followers isn't most peoples cup of tea....  first I will tell you a little of myself I'll try and make it interesting but if youre really genuine well this probly be something good:) I grew up in a city called Hamilton deep down south of the earth in a country as people know it New Zealand i am Maori... being  a Christan or trying to be Christan wasn't easy it still isn't and we slipped up a lot of the times tho I know now that kinda thing is not really that important ya know making mistakes the big guy upstairs doesn't want us beating up ourselves up on that but its more about the good in us now and the progress we have made he looks at our positives not on what's negative I've accomplished something's in life something's I'm really proud of one that comes to mind is my being faithful,loyal,commited to God in the good times and the bad was it a straight run of loyalty no it wasnt but did I put my heart and soul into it yes I did with all my strength and fibre of my being but was that continuous no again lol. we are construction sites wonderful and beautiful works of art in the making I was 18 when i first got diagnosed with a mental condition known as scizoaffective disorder I tell you it is hellish many days of weeping in and out of hospital anyways I won't go down that line what I want to point out is that maybe what you are looking for you already have or maybe I know this for sure in this world we live in there exists everywhere and we may sometimes feel it or exposed ourselves to it or it revealing itself to us what I'm talking about is Christ's presence his essence what it feels like to be aware that he is with you and near you I tell you when you tap into that hmm yeah... I also thought about identity also purpose real believers take on their true identity they learn the purpose for which they were born For Great and wonderful yes even supernatural things bless you will smith and if ever you need or desire to feel the presence of god you need only to put your mind on him seek him out prayer is really good for this true from the heart prayer and you can have his presence everyday its free OK I've talked to much laterz:) fresh prince:) oh btw I'm healed from that illness thanks to the master brain surgeon Jesus Christ:)",0.9987,563
