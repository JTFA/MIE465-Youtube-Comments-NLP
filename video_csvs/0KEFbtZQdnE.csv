"I have the upmost respect for single parents as I was raised by a single mother myself. I know that there are many situations where one of the parents being around could be worse for the child due to abuse, mental issues, etc. However, to say that it isn't ideal for a child to have both parents is silly. Subconsciously we all crave to have both of those parents in our lives to love, teach and validate us. We are designed to have that two parent relationship. Although it is sometimes necessary to separate a child from an unhealthy or potentially harmful parent, there will always be some level of lack there. There are so many incredible single parents out there who do everything they can to make their kids lives great, but I think it does them a disservice to pretend that there isn't something missing. This either leads to more bitterness and hurt of the child missing the parent or shame for feeling that way.

"The issue with single-parenting and children being unhappy because of it does NOT lie within the parent's disability to raise their child on their own, it's a deeply psychological one. My mom practically raised me and my brother on her own since our father was always working, and then my parents got divorced when I was 10. My mom is an amazing mom and I never had a real relationship or any desire to spend more time with my father anyway because, as a person, he's just an asshole, but the fact still remains that because of this I feel like I never really had a dad and that most children who grow up with single parents aren't as happy or fulfilled as those who grew up with both parents. And three examples of famous people who grew up with single parents don't mean shit.",0.8477,154

"The psychology of a child will be different depending on if they were raised in the church or not, if they went to private school, public school, or were homeschooled, if they have a sibling or are an only child, or if they were raised by parents or anyone that wasn't their parents. That doesn't mean that one is better than the other or that one child will be happier than the other, because we don't know their situation, why they live the life they do.",0.743,95

"To be honest I've been guilty of a lot of these assumptions. I am sorry for that. I could give you explanations/excuses, but I imagine you don't really care right?

Sometimes, growing up, we're fed all this rubbish about how to live and what our goals should be, including parenthood. We also watch the world and decide what kind of example we want to set and live out too.
Honestly some of us are deeply hurt by the way we grew up and our parents' inadequacies. That's not your problem to worry about - you have your own lives. I hope you realize not all of us said these things out of malice. Quite a few of us asked these dumb questions because we wanted better for future generations than how we were raised, and are slowly realizing that this or that criticism doesn't actually prevent your children from being the amazing people that we wanted to see improve the world. Y'all sound marvelous though, so keep it up. Peace!",0.9187,190

"val ravn lol i simply stated my biological stand point because YOU made it a point tell me an aray of things about mothers from other species do which came off more like showboating especially because it was really irrelevant to the converation (human parents). You mentioned elton John kids and i ASKED (not stated unlike my supposed 'insistance of your ignorance') if you think a kid not having a mother is natural since you seem to find it justifyable for them to not have one in the place of a different form of care.
