"Absolutely a great feat no doubt but I also would like to know the trail vs the CD. There is no stream at the CD level, making it a very thirsty trek.",0.0693,35
Absolutely beautiful. How hard was this trail and how long did it take you to complete? I'd love to start hiking so I might take this up. Did you see anyone else along the trail or was it just you and your group?,0.8438,47
Amazing journey and video guys thanks for sharing it.,0.8591,10
Amazing video,0.5859,2
Amazing!! So many questions spring into my head though! How do you stay on track? How long did it take? Do you literally walk all day or do you camp out longer somewhere you enjoyed? What do you do for food? How expensive was it? This is something I genuinely want to do!,0.8892,62
Amazing. It's so important to stop and capture a moment that moves you.,0.5314,15

"Came across your blog the other day, i was looking up about bears on the PCT,  haha. I want to hike the triple crown,  i'm from Australia and have quite a fear of being ripped to shreds by a bear. However,  i cannot let this stop my dreams right?  ðŸ˜‚ Lovely video",0.5868,59

I attempted the John Muir Trail (solo) and failed. Â I have nothing but respect for people who actually complete these treks. Â Its so much easier to dream than it is to actually do something.,0.2816,39

"T Bone - Precisely.  By the size of some of those streams, the CDT must detour substantial distances from the continental divide.  This does not diminish their feat,  of course, but I'm curious to find a map of the trail vs the CD.",0.5187,49

Thank you so much for sharing this,0.6771,7
That was beautiful! That was a lot of bear country / mountain lion territory you hiked through. Do you guys carry any kind of self defense e.g. counter assault spray?,0.2244,36

That's insane. Well done! Did anyone of you have to quit? No sickness or anything during these 5 months?,-0.5349,23

"The trail is not a literal tracing of the divide, it runs parallel in parts and can be a mile or more away.  I did a piece in the Wid River Range recently and it followed and crossed the Green River several times.  it would be near impossible for a trail to pass over some of the peaks in that range, which would require expert technical climbing.",0.0,72
There is NOT a single steam that crosses the Continental Divide! So those stream crossings must have been substantial detours from the Continental Divide.,0.2714,26
This is the thing that makes me most jealous of the yanks. We've got shite like the lakes and all that business but it doesn't come close to 1 shot from this video.,-0.1018,35
