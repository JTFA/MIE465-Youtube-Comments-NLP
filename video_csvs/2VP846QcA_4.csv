"Cool fight, but how did she recover so quickly, from the crowbar to the face?  Yeah, yeah.  It is just a video, but if they are going to add realism to the fight, they should make the recovery times, at least mirror reality to some degree.  I like the arm entrapment, but I think she should have had the Krav maga  instructor's right arm, more controlled, so she could get in closer, and control his head.",0.6486,90
