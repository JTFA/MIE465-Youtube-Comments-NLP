He isn't really a bad guy, but he caved to the popular opinion. I think my country will follow in America's footsteps and elect another Trump when, like America, we get tired of being called racist and mysogynistic for breathing. Racism didn't get Trump elected, 3rd wave feminism did. Is it so much to ask for a levelheaded leader who sits central on the spectrum? Someone who will promote true equality, and not the cancer that SJWs speak of where men are killed? I'm bigender and pansexual and I know I'm a huge faggot, but I dont want any celebration. I don't want special treatment, I just want to not be treated less. And I have found that to only be an issue with who I associate with. The true issues people ignore like the disfigurement of young girls in Africa, the legal status of rape in the middle East and the killing and internment of gays in the east are pushed aside because the selfish cunts can't fucking put their  own self interest aside for a second and fight for what they claim their beliefs are.

"Where's the commentary about this woman, who's more or less saying that MOTHERS (i.e., maternal love) is more important than FATHERS?  As a female, I am sick to death of the fact that so many women truly believe that mothers are more important, and that the fathers are mere 'accessories'...that fathers will never be as good a parent as the mothers...that most dads are bumbling idiots, and essentially 'another child' for the mother to care for.  I hear this kind of talk all the time from women, and it's NOT ok.  These are the very same women who would complain about sexism against women, but who think nothing of making sexist comments about men.  

Why are there so many groups called 'Mothers Against This' and 'Mothers Against That', instead of 'PARENTS Against This or That'?  By naming their groups this way, these mothers are excluding men, or making an incorrect assumption that dads simply 'don't care as much'.

Fathers are equally important in the parent-child equation, but so long as society as a whole continues to hold up MOTHERS as being the only ones who really matter, then we are doing our children (esp. our SONS, who will themselves be FATHERS one day) a grave injustice.",-0.3526,250
