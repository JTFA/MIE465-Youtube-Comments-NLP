I love how supportive his wife is in the videos. Even though he spends countless hours doing these videos she still can be happy and cheerful when you finally succeeded in his goal.,0.9468,35
"I really love your videos, very inspirational...!
Learning is all about finding your path, getting closer to the person you want to be, being able to change your ""human inertia"" in order to get a new direction or a new start, right ?
During the video, I thought about a new direction everybody should be at least a little bit concerned about, ecology, balance in the exosystem, etc. It's all about learning what as value and what as ""not"", what is rare, what is disposable and what is priceless. What is wise, and what is not, etc.
Maybe empty bottles and un-painted cardboards would have worked just fine ? I don't know. No major issues really, just talking !

I would love to see you connect some ideological concept with your learning skills. Here's one, if you dare (one I'm still trying to learn myself) :

Learn to spend 15 days with 0 waste. No plastics, no waste. Maybe some glass, because good recycling efficiency. That's a big one, hope you like the idea !
