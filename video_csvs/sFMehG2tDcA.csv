Truth is, by saving that one, he may have inadvertently killed a whole litter of babies that it was rearing.  These animals are perfectly capable of surviving with out us and their burrows are deep enough in the ground to protect them from wildfires.  It is a bittersweet image.  My heart goes out to all the humans & bunnies affected by these catastrophic, man made fires.",0.8082,102
"I commend this person, even though he endangered his live to save the rabbit. If the world had more people like him, a lot more, with his compassion and concern over others, there would be less killing and wars. You go to the other end of the spectrum and have too many of those that think, everyone else or everything else is there for your convenience and benefit, then you have a world in which we live in now. If I was ever in a situation with my back against a wall, it would be very comforting to know, that this person or someone with a similar physiological profile was near. It is very possible that this person or one that is very similar to him, could be, their very best friend. I take my hat off to him and he is given me faith, that there are more people out there who could be the same.",0.966,174
