"Drew, I'm with you bud. This ESA crap is outta hand. These people are SO stressed about flying that they want to take their pets along for free! I hope you don't mind but...Everyone should look at the ACAA  info. If you go to WWW.TRANSPORTATION.GOV they will find out that there are rules in play outside of the ADA! Once you are on the site just search the article called: Service Animals (Including Emotional Support Animals). It tells you about the size of the animals, where they can be kept etc... It gives you the rules they have to go by regarding what they consider a service animal. And it gives you the dept. to go to if you have a problem so they can be and intermediary to look at the situation. It's a very important article provided by the gov't to help everyone. I really feel bad for those of us with real problems. Not the ones who are just lonely and want company or are to cheap to board their animal or pay for it's ticket! I know there is not legit registration and it's important it stay that way. But this helps us educate those around us and even those from the airlines who are ill informed. I'd love your opinion on this info. Is it helpful. I'm new to the S.D. community. I put off getting one until I really needed one. And I wanted to as informed as possible before I took on the responsibility, of not just the animal, but being out there representing this community. Just like you all do every day. How your animal behaves reflects on everyone else. Personally I think these SD should  pass a Canine Good Citizenship test. My last dog got his. It just shows that they can behave well in public. It isn't a giant undertaking. It shows that they aren't going to attack another dog, or jump all over people etc... just the basics.",0.9565,370

"For anyone wondering, this is what the law is in the USA regarding service animals, therapy animals, and emotional support animals:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6MQwSAO-tY
Long story short, the difference between them is how they're trained and what they do. Emotional support animals don't receive any training at all.
Businesses are legally allowed to ask 2 questions: 1) ""Is that a service animal?"" and 2) ""What service does this animal provide?""
Businesses are not legally required to grant access if it is not a service animal. The only special access emotional support animals get is in residences, like apartments that would otherwise forbid pets. 
This is a guide to spotting a fake service animal:

"I have crippling anxiety, ptsd, bipolar disorder, AND depression. Yeah. I know. You feel sorry for me. Anywho, I have an emotional support/service dog named Maisy. She's an Australian shepherd and ngl the cutest freaking thing ever. She's been through Over a year of training and is very calm and collected, but I still don't like people touching her. She also gets very protective and doesn't let people touch me (my ptsd is from being sexually assaulted as a child, and I have a fear of being touched by people I don't know) and so if anyone shoves me and I say ""Maisy, schützen"" she jumps up on them and if I say ""knurre"" she'll also growl. Basically this grown man walks up to me and starts petting her and I said ""please stop"" because Maisy isn't very trusting of strangers and doesn;t enjoy being pet by people she doesn't know (although she tolerates it because she's been trained to). Basically he says, ""why not? Your dog looks deprived of attention, and you are preventing people from showing it love? That's sick!"" Then I said, ""No, she's just a service dog and doesn't like being touched by stragers."" And he started shouting (take into mind that this was at the grocery store and there were people around us) ""Oh that's bullshit! You're not blind! Quit the hoax!"" Before pushing me, which caused me to stumble back. Three people cut in and I said ""Maisy, schützen knurre"" and she jumped up and started growling, and he THREW HER INTO THE WALL. I started crying and ran up to her and he ran out of the store. We filed a police report. We're gonna find out who he is and sue him.",-0.974,349
"I have heard of support Cheetas and support Wolves, but a Peacock? Those things have a wingspan of 7 feet, all hell would break loose if it even spread it's tail on a plane. There is also a difference between Emotional Support Animals and Service Animals. ESA's are just there for you to feel comfortable, as if you have social anxiety or something. trained Service Animals have special skill to be able to detect if the handler is feeling ill or about to have an attack, and will protect the person/provide pressure/give assistance in walking. My aunt had a support dog for 13 years because she had epilepsy and the dog would alert her if she was about to have a seizure. Emotional Support Dogs are not trained, they are just there to make you feel happier, being if you have depression or anxiety. A lot of people need to realize there is a difference.",0.8537,173
I have no issue with a peacock as an ESA. However if that is your choice for one do your due diligence first. Be prepared for many places to deny you entry and make other arrangements.

"I wouldn’t be comfortable next to a peacock but I could cope if it didn’t *scream*. My old neighbour had goats, chickens & a Peacock, his yard wasn’t much bigger than ours, we lived in the suburbs. One day the goat got quiet & the next day he had a BBQ, we were pretty sure he was raising unusual animals for traditional food. Every day that bloody bird would scream & I’d think “Eat the peacock! Please eat the peacock?” So that’s a thing. If the ESA was a snake I’d have to move to another seat because you can’t ask a nervous flyer to move, that would make them feel worse. Airlines really need to establish a protocol where passengers with animal phobias can change seats with people who don’t give a sh*t. It’s an interesting question tho, where is the line & should there even be a line? The cut-off would have to be “can this animal move through the plane if necessary for bathroom breaks?

"omg people why doesn't everyone knock off the craziness and get nice.. preferably cuddly esa.. at least one smart enough where you can trust it not to attack people.. exotics and large birds like that are hard to control.. but trying to bring it on a plane..  my nephew has a chicken (she's huge) and she's pretty calm ,easy to handle but i wouldn't try taking her into public. in a confined place full of people.. I would have a easier time training my rabbits to be es animals.. come on some people have hamsters and guinea pigs..  you can't deal with furry.. your allergic..? then get a parrot.. their smart and can be trained.. and some of the more exotic ones can talk.. :P",0.9787,143
