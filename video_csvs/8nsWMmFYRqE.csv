"After all these years, all we went thru including both losing our Dad's in 2017 (March & September), All the drama bc I'm a woman & u, my bestfriend, a man. Nothing was going to come between us! But after all the times I dropped & ran bc u needed me. All the nights sleeping in cars bc u were homeless, taking u into our home and helping u move from 1 place to another, got u a roof over your head & away from the drama! Doing anything I could to help you bc that's what friends do... I prayed for u to get help, tried to get u the help u needed! Finally got the people who I knew wanted to help u as well to come together for an intervention! And now that u are sober, u dont need me anymore. After everything, u are now to good to have anything to do with me. You wont call, text, or talk to me at all & u won't see me. So ""No Reason to Stay, is a good reason to go"" bc ""all I do is give & all u do is take"" This song has made me realize that guys like u are why women like myself have trust issues! You will try to do the bare minimum to keep me around but only bc u are afraid of being alone & bc that way u always have a person to use to blame, so u dont have to face reality, or admit that u are addicted to drama & u cant remember what is truth & what is lies.",0.8632,306

"Ik hield van je, ik dacht dat ik niet hoger kon komen
Je novemberregen kan de nacht in brand staan, de nacht in brand staan
Maar we konden slechts zo lang branden
Nagemaakte emoties raken de huid alleen diep
Weet dat je liegt als je naast me ligt, naast me
Hoe zijn we zover gekomen?


Ik zou het nu moeten weten
Je zou het nu moeten weten
Dat zouden we nu wel moeten weten


Er moet iets gebeuren, er moet iets breken
Maar alles wat ik doe is geven en alles wat je doet is nemen
Er moet iets veranderen, maar ik weet dat het dat niet zal doen
Geen reden om te blijven is een goede reden om te gaan
Is een goede reden om te gaan, ooh


Ik heb nog nooit gehoord dat een stilte zo hard werd verwijderd
Ik loop door de kamer en je maakt geen geluid, maak een geluid
Je bent goed in me klein voelen
Als het me geen pijn doet, waarom huil ik dan nog steeds?
Als het me niet doodde, dan ben ik half levend, half levend
Hoe zijn we zover gekomen?

Ik zou het nu moeten weten
Je zou het nu moeten weten
Dat zouden we nu wel moeten weten


Er moet iets gebeuren, er moet iets breken
Maar alles wat ik doe is geven en alles wat je doet is nemen
Er moet iets veranderen, maar ik weet dat het dat niet zal doen
Geen reden om te blijven is een goede reden om te gaan
Is een goede reden om te gaan

Ik zou het nu moeten weten, dat zou je nu wel moeten weten
Ik denk dat ik nu aan het breken ben, ooh
Ik zou het nu moeten weten, dat zou je nu wel moeten weten
Ik denk dat ik op dit moment aan het breken ben

Er moet iets gebeuren, er moet iets breken
Maar alles wat ik doe is geven en alles wat je doet is nemen
Er moet iets veranderen, maar ik weet dat het dat niet zal doen
Geen reden om te blijven is een goede reden om te gaan
Is een goede reden om te gaan, ooh
Er moet iets gegeven worden",-0.2359,391

"Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?
I should know by now, you should know by now
We should know by now
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay, is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive
How did we get so far gone?
I should know by now, you should know by now
We should know by now
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay, is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
