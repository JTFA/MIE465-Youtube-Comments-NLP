"Eyeliner was LIFE back then! Lol I wouldn't leave the house without it.  We just wanted to be Avril Lavigne so bad.  Remember wearing ties over band tee shirts? With your completed makeup on in this video, you look just like my best friend's older sister back in the day (who we idolized).  You still look amazing, even with the garish eyeliner! If it were 2004, we'd be copying this look instead of laughing at it.  I'm glad that eyeliner fad has gone away though.  I can't wait to laugh at 2017-18's eyebrow craze in a few years.  :P",0.9418,115

We all did our makeup like that and thought we looked good bc at that time it did! Lol makeup trends change over time like anything else. Funny hearing you talk about seeing a girl do her waterline and that's how you learned bc I was thinking to myself while you was applying the top liner on lower lid...I watched a friend do her top waterline and it started me to do it lol...your younger than me...this was in the 90s and we were still teasing our hair lol....so imagine how I feel looking back at my pic 😂😂😂. My brother talked about how ugly he was back when he was teen and he is 4 yrs older and he had a mullet and said damn I was ugly!! I said now if you were to look like that yeah but at that time he wasn't and actually got all the girls and all my friends always had crush on him...but its so funny to look back but embarrassing too.
