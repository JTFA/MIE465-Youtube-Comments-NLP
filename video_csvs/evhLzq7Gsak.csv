"Here's my prediction on this sexual harassment avalanche that's going on at the moment. At some point in 2018 it will probably happen in States first my prediction for that is that it will be New York or California and that newly fashion state law, using the criteria for Obamacare compliance threshold will require those companies to fund the salary of a human resource officer but that employee will be answerable to a newly created bureaucratic state agency and not to the company that pays the salary as to make reporting sexual harassment easier and less threatening for those victimized. You may say that sounds good but here's the downside, as with all bureaucratic agencies they will be box checkers and form fillerouters whereas if you're HR at a midsize company you are aware that Bob and Jane are competing for the same job and if during the process of obtaining that job Jane complains of sexual harassment by Bob they have to investigate it but in reality HR knows that the timing is suspicious and that it is most likely frivolous barring any evidence. But after they passed through New New York state law which will most likely become federal law if a woman doesn't like you for some reason or wants your job all she has to do is point. That's it point. Now you're out of work Jane has your job and since it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen you might be facing divorce also. So a big sarcastic thank you to all of you multi-millionaires who for some reason found it impossible to go to a strip club or to have a girlfriend in another city but you had to fondle your secretary or co-worker, again thank you for making life that much more difficult for me who has never sexually harassed a soul.",-0.9666,320

Where is Walter Cronkite when we need him?

Hard hitting news requires hard hitting reporting. Something fluffy will never understand. ......

For those of us who believe this new Age of Aquarius also ushers in the return of the Divine Feminie, it is no surprise women are beginning to protest bad behavior. Expect much more to be revealed as this behavior (powerful vs hungry and powerless) has become firmly entrenched during  the Age of Pisces  (approx. 2000 years worth).

 What was 'normal business' is no longer. Just as slavery was, then wasnt. Women voting wasn't,  then was. Etc...... History is FULL of  'normals' that we'd put someone into prison for today.

As we grow more compassionate and loving toward our fellow humans, more previously 'turn a blind eye to' behaviors will be thought to be Unacceptable.
