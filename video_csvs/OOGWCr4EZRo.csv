The National Organization of Women have been speaking out against fathers groups since 1996.  Just last year, they opposed a shared custody bill in Florida.  There have been similar bills in Massachusetts since the 80s and feminist groups oppose them every time.

The policy states that police are required to protect he woman in all cases... even if she's the attacker.  There are thousands of men who have been arrested because their wives or girlfriends attack them.  Feminists asked for that.
Feminists say they want men to be encouraged to show their emotions?  Then why did they create the hashtag #masculinitysofragile and #killallmen ?  Why do they sell t-shirts and coffee mugs saying, ""I bathe in male tears?""
Would you please stop with the bullshit that feminists are striving for ""equality,"" please?!
You may not hate men, but, make no mistake, feminists preach it.  You may not have noticed the hatred because it's not aimed at you.

The 'female' part of feminism just means that they make observations from the female point of view. Feminists want women and men to be treated equally, and for men to not decide on what the standard is that we want to reach, but for women to decide for themselves.",0.2144,124

Feminists advocate that women have the ability to opt-out of being a parent after a baby is conceived, but fight against men having that same right.
Feminists fight to strip funding from domestic violence shelters that cater to men because ""men don't need it.""
Oh, lets not forget, feminists were furious that Jennifer Lawrence got paid less than Jeremy Renner for American Hustle, but, when it was reported that she made double what Chris Pratt made for Passengers, feminists applauded it.

"Well, there are a lot of examples of conservatives burning down crosses, lynching black people, beating up LGBTQ people, and you have the example of Nazi attacks in Germany, not to mention ISIS, one of the biggest ultraconservative groups in our current time. And those protests you're referring to (which obviously the far-right media only covers the more destructive protesters and portrays them like baboons and doesn't explain their intentions) are protesting for equality and dignity and because people are being killed by police violence all the time, while when conservatives protest it's because they think their race is superior to other races and they feel threatened by giving dignity and equality to other human beings and refuse to admit that we are all equal and just want to be united. Unity in the human race, the thing that conservatives hate the most.",-0.9499,156

the march was for a change to inherited social norms that disproportionately objectify and discriminate against women despite laws that are supposed to secure equal freedoms as men. People wouldn't kill their babies if republicans didnt make their lives not worth living.,0.7699,44
the point is to raise awareness of the disproportionate abuse of women in your country and around the world. if you are denying that then you have no idea of the extent of sexual assault that women endure. or you are denying the abuse which makes you a cunt.,-0.9698,52
