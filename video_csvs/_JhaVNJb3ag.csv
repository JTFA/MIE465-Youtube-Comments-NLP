Most of these olds males are males that have been run out of their old pack due to a younger male(s) taking over, on their own they will starve and die after a few weeks. They are too old to hunt effectively, and they are not used to it as their Lionesses did the hunting prior to this, they simply starve after a few weeks. It is more humane to give it an ethical death than to let it starve to death over a period of 2-3 weeks, yet people don't like it because all they see is an ""evil hunter"".",-0.9887,177

"It's a bit disingenuous to simply show a dying polar bear and say this is the result of global warming. Like humans, animals can get diseases that can cause this. For example if a polar bear gets cancer, he will slowly deteriorate, lose lots of weight, no longer be able to hunt for food until he eventually succumbs. Talking about ice is irrelevant to a polar bear starving as polar bears will eat any living creatures and many of the animals they prey on do not stay confined to ice areas. Seals for example who are one of their main sources of food can be found all over the earth from frigid cold places to the hottest places on earth. This is part of why I cut the cable some time ago as even networks like Discovery Channel and Nat Geo which once offered something in the way of educational shows have now started to inject political propaganda into their shows to socially engineer the sheep.
