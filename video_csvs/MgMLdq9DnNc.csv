I've been rocking with you since I was in high school and I'm am now about to graduate from college (woot woot) you've been a huge source of inspiration for me and I love how deep you are and how much you also strive to impact us (your subscribers) positively. Much love to you ❤️,0.9729,71
"Hi Jenn! If you're looking for a great book, I have one I read this month that I thought was amazing! I'm a big fan of self-improvement books. I read ""How To Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk"" by Adele Faber! Although this book is targeted towards parents, while I was reading the book I truly felt that this book is a must-read for everyone! Talking to kids is not all that different from talking to everyone around us, and this book really helped me understand the most helpful and useful tools to use in pivotal points of conversations. I've even written notes down to bring with me throughout my days to reference because it really takes a lot of work to change the way you're used to speaking! Let me know if you end up taking a look at this book :) 
Other favorite books I have are The Nightingale, I Will Teach You To Be Rich for personal finances, The Four Agreements, and I love reading relationship/marriage-based books!",0.9886,193

No matter how good he says and writes in the book, I hope you can find your true joy by listening to other honest ones.",0.8977,95
