One of these laws dictates that anyone who wants to immigrate to the US must go through a process in order to do so. Instead, they say ""Fuck US law I'll do as I please!"". Not only do they enter our country as lawbreakers, but then they are allowed government subsidies no questions asked, which then are not available to lawful American citizens. The point here is that Democrats jump through hoops in order to make you feel racist if you have a problem with illegal immigrants flooding across our border. they use this tactic in order to use them for their votes because they will help insure a democratic rule.

And he points it out constantly he has made it appear that he is the only one who is listening to their problems and cares about them. Meanwhile social justice Warriors and feminists are constantly vilifying white people and Trump supporters treating them like they are Satan incarnate. If you despise Trump supporters simply because they support Trump you are a bigot plain and simple. I myself do not like Trump, Hell I voted for Bernie. But I also understand what all the idiots at MSNBC and CNN fail to realize: As Long As Trump and his supporters are built up to be the great Satan, there will be no defeating him, because the constant smear campaign against him only makes him more and more of a martyr to his base.
