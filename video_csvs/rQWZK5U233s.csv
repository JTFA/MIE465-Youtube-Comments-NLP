"Here's the best thing I've ever heard. Don't get mad when someone does something better than you- especially if it's something you don't even care about. The reason you do this is because you feel unloved, or unappreciated, or like you're not good enough at something you want to be. Remember this: Everyone who is good at something sucked at it once. You CAN do this. You don't have to be upset, you have to be motivated. (Brought on by the dislikes)",-0.276,95

"It starts out as a love song, saying that without the one you love all the riches in the world will 'Never be enough'. But then you remember that what the song is also saying, is that for some people, like Barnum and like Lind, nothing is ever enough. His wife knows that Barnum will always want something more, that's why she's afraid of losing him because Lind is like that as well. That's the tragedy of this song, being in love with someone who finds it hard to be satisfied, being afraid that your love will never be enough for him or her, and being a person who is always wanting something more.",0.9764,128
