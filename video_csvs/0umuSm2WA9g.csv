"Bernard Francis Law (November 4, 1931 – December 20, 2017) was an American cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.

He was Archbishop emeritus of Boston, former archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and Cardinal Priest of Santa Susanna, which was the American Catholic church in Rome (until summer 2017, when the American community was relocated to another parish).

Law was the Archbishop of Boston from 1984 until his resignation on December 13, 2002, in response to the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal, after church documents showed he had extensive knowledge of sexual abuse committed by dozens of Catholic priests within his archdiocese, and had failed to remove them from the ministry.

One priest alone was alleged to have raped or molested 130 children over several decades, while Law and other local officials moved him among churches rather than going to the authorities.

Two years after Law resigned from his position in Boston, which the Church called ""an important step in the healing process"", Pope John Paul II appointed him as Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome in 2004.

He resigned from this position upon reaching the age of 80 in November 2011, and died in Rome on December 20, 2017, at the age of 86.",-0.9846,240

Once again, I (Maureen) see a Great Flame that I have come to know as the Heart of God the Father. He says: ""I AM WHO AM. I come to you as the Heavenly Father. You have a clear sky today, as all the clouds have parted. I compare that to the conscience of the world. I speak here* to clear away the cloudy conditions in hearts and to make clear these times you are in. Many await with anxiety the coming of the apocalypse. I tell you, solemnly, you are already living in the hour of the apocalypse. Nuclear arms are in the hands of evil. That, in itself, is enough to bring time, as you know it, to an end. You have a record-breaking fire escalating in California. Natural disasters are increasing in numbers and intensity. This is not the hour to decide if what I tell you is true. It is the hour to act on your decision that what I say is true."" 

""Your actions should include more prayer and sacrifices - fasting if you are able; propagation of these messages and learning of your dependency upon your angels. Live in the Truth. That way we will be victorious together.""

Read Revelations 12:7-12+ 

Michael Defeats the Dragon 

Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world - he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, ""Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!""

"Speaking of kiddie fiddlers. Gather around children, it's story time! In Sweden MENA muslim immigrants sexually assault over 600 little boys and girls under the age of 14 every year, some victims are as young as 3. Muslims are overrepresented in child sex abuse cases by more than 1600 percent compared to the population in general. Across the EU the total number of victims every year can be counted in the 10s of thousands. Meanwhile, main stream media refuses to report on it even though it's their duty as journalists to do so. Eurolies would sooner go off air and close its doors than touch the subject with a 10 foot pole. As a journalist it's your duty to expose these things, not doing it means your culpable! You're every bit as culpable as this cardinal is for not reporting the crimes.
