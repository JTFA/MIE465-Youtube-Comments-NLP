"That Blake block is kinda sucky though.  I mean who else other than Blake can truly mentor a country singer?  Blake is limited, but no one does country like Blake on this panel. Yes, the others are talented, but country isn't their niche. I hope who ever he picks can actually mentor him properly and improve his work. I know there is competition between the coaches, but I hope not at the expense of the contestant's highest good.  Cause they all know if this man wants a solid for his career he belongs with Blake.",0.8905,106

The US version is so much better than the Dutch version. Here the judges are disrespectful towards the contestants and each other that it not fun to watch anymore . In the states they really hear when some one has talent like the guy in this clip. His voice is just perfect and i love Alicia and Kelly . The guys are sweet and cool to and i love how to act towards each other . Yes there is a competition between them but they keep it funny and not hatefully.,0.9654,94
