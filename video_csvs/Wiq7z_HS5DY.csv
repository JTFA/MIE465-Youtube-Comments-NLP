I need this. Please when will it come out? 💜💜💜💜,0.3182,14
I would almost want this cuz of how holographic glittery it looks but the name of it kills the product for me. I enjoy a funny or naughty product name (on lipsticks usually) but GLOW JOB is just crude and gross. Especially cuz it’s a gooey mask. The mask is obviously a euphemism for cum which is disgusting.,-0.9081,66

Their girls.. don't want to see glitter on them.. even smell? Then men stop fucking me.... cause I get all this sexy glitter on them... but whatever they go for their gay boyfriends.. and like it in the butt... Geeez wives have it hard. @_@  weird cause people be like.. find men that don't fuck around.. or don't fuck around.. .NEW""S Flash.. 2.5 of/men women.. have this issues...

"No doubt this mask is STUNNING...but I mean who wears makeup when they're putting on a face mask 😂... But anyways. With jokes aside, I wonder what this is actually supposed to do for my skin. Because it just seems like it'd be for showing off on snapchat or looking pretty. Or that it's marketed towards people with perfect skin. I have sensitive skin. So I wonder if it burns or would irritate my skin because of all the glitter and whatever's inside this mask. I'd like to know.",0.7506,100
"No way. I'm never sarcastic when it comes to gold or glitter. I'm exactly the type of person who market researchers look at when they want to know if their products are any good and if they think people are  chumpy enough to buy them. Answer is yup, right here.
