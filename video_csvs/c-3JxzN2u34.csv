As a fellow Boricua living in America I understand how he feels especially when those that are supposed to lead and help put us down looking at us the value of human life with a price tag... but it's so uplifting to see one man step up for his people bolstering a huge feeling of hope,0.8779,57
"Because of Lin-Manuel's status, his initiatives will be executed. For those of us who are collecting supplies from our neighborhoods to send to Puerto Rico, we wonder, ""What if this is all in vain.""  But we believe in a higher power that controls all, and we couldn't just sit around crying and not take any action.  There is no doubt in my mind that the American people care about Puerto Rico, because of the generosity I have been honored to see and feel from every ethnicity who has contributed money, checks, and supplies for our cause.  However, we pray that supplies get to the people that need it.  That somehow, divine intervention takes place, breaks through the barriers, because people are hungry, have no running water, and some are dying.",0.802,151

"I hope HIS money from his stupid $800 per seat play is being used and not donations from some guy working for minimum wage.
800 per seat in a 500 seat theater is 400,000. Multiply that by 40 theaters nationwide and he's got 16,000,000. Multiply that by 5 countries with 40 theaters with 500 seats and you got 80,000,000",0.2263,67
