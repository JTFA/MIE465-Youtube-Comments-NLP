Hi Mr. Neal Young. It is very special for me. Hear you in my Teens only by the way. Hear you with my best girl friend which I knew until now. But I never hear you as my favourite Musician.  But when I saw Andreas Rebers in Gernany as an 51years old journalist whith an improvisation of your title I become neugierig. :.-) Seen a lot to my surprise. YOU ARE SO WUNDERFUL. And so the most loved video for me is you and crazy horse at stotinkika.,0.9387,101

"Sad. Neil lost his critical ear for making great music after he recorded Mirror Ball. That's over 20 years ago. ""America"", as a serious subject for songwriters is, by and large, a losing propostion. The country simply doesn't like to be fawned over in three or four minutes of wishful thinking set to music. Paul Simon called one of his songs ""America"" and that was the truest definition of the country ever expressed if you happened to be a white and wide-eyed adolescent innocent at the time. If the country could talk back  it would tell Neil Young that for his health's sake at least, he should at long last retire. Rappers have the situation well in hand. Many of them have been telling the ""American truth"" with uncanny accuracy for at least as far back as the times when Neil released stellar albums, and whether their reports are signals of doom or salvation for America is still to be determined.",0.6111,181
