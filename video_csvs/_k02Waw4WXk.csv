Both of these songs have helped me to come to terms with myself and who I am and realize that ""You will not be alone with your thoughts, well you will, but you won't in a way"" can be such a tremendous comfort. It's the writers, musicians, dancers, actors, and artists that put themselves out there, as you do, who allow vulnerability to be a strength that get us all through the day and teach us all to cope with that horrendous nagging sense of doubt, insecurity, and self-imposed isolation.

"Blume is an excellent writer, who is frequently overlooked/forgotten. I was actually exposed to her writing while taking a class in college on Creative writing for Young Readers. So it never dawned on me that I was a man reading ""female"" literature. I've never been one to feel bound up by genre definitions.

I can remember reading that one of her adult novels, ""Wifey"" was on the proposed banned book list for the Gainesville (or maybe it is known as the Alachua County) Library. So, naturally, I had to read it. It was a smart, sassy, funny, and compelling read.

After reading it, I remember writing a letter to the editor of the Gainesville Sun, defending the First Amendment, and pointing out the hypocrisy of politicians who scream for less government interfering with that amendment. I finished the letter thanking them for the reading suggestion. Not long after the letter was published, I got a phone call on a Saturday morning, and it was a local commissioner, Mac MacEachern, wanting to discuss my letter and why he proposed putting the book on the list. I don't remember too much about the conversation, other than it was cordial, and neither of us changed our position.

So, yeah, read some Judy Blume.

Thanks for the reminder, Amanda.",0.9099,255

"LittleMissEvel 
Not at all! See a couple of people there reading in bed,
And I'll bet someone there is down flat on the floor instead.
And I am at home now, in bed with my cat and my phone
As so often I am with a book, so I won't feel alone.
I've been reading like this now for most of my seventy years,
And sometimes I burst into laughter, and sometimes to tears.
Judy Blume gave me plenty of both, as a teen and a man, 
And I'll head for the library soon, as soon as I can. 
There's so much of her magic that I've never read!
And I want it ALL, before I am dead. 

And Amanda, your song's gotten into my brain
And I thank you for that, it'll help me stay sane. 
While so much in the world provokes terror and gloom
There's harbor and healing and health. Thank you too, Judy Blume.",-0.4409,180
