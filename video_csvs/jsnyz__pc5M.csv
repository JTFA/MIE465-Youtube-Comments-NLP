THIS is legit. This is so beautiful because of the immaculate mixing on the angelic vocals of these two goddesses. The production is so fresh but doesn't require much to make it that. It allows the voices to really ride the melody and when the 808 bass came in and then following the drums it all brings together a magical piece of music that is triumphant in its sound. It is a piece of great victory even if one is content in their losses..all in all these kids gon be alright.,0.9568,98
