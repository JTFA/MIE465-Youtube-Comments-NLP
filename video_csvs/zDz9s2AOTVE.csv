"THIS KANE is the WWF Attitude persona of Kane that we LOVED (the original ""Big Red Machine"" Kane). The only difference is now the WWE had revamped Kane's attire, mask, and entrance theme music a bit by adding a slight twist to it. Plus Kane still talks and is not as big as he was in 1997-1999. Brock Lesnar can only beat CORPORATE KANE (human Kane) in a match, but NO WAY IN HELL (PUN INTENDED!) could Brock Lesnar EVER stand a chance against prime Kane (which is the masked Kane we see right now!).",-0.8408,114
