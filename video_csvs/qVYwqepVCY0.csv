Disney basically bans any critics who give bad reviews. Look what they did with the LA Times. I wouldn't doubt Disney has an office team of supposed critics. The Last Jedi was awful. disrespect of legacy characters just for the sake of it. Superman Lea.... boring and bad acting from the newer characters. Rey phoned it in. Kylo made no progression and is the same whiny helmet smashing teen he was in the last movie. Even Snoke (who was just a copy of the Emperor from return of the Jedi) called out what a little b#tch Kylo is. Snoke is also a joke. Plotholes galore. The whole SJW aspect. I could go on and on.

I don’t care who directs episode nine I won’t be spending a penny on a ticket to support this crap any longer, the only Star Wars movie I’m looking forward to Obi Wan because I know Kathleen Kennedy can’t kill him off and replace him with a shit character.

"I looked at the rotten tomatoes fan score. I looked at many of the reviews.  The vast majority are either 1 star votes or 4 or 5 star votes. They are split at about half and half with a few 2 or 3 stars thrown in. Hence the roughly 56% score. It averages out to an average score. It’s just one of those movies that polarizes audiences by nature. Can’t help it.  I personally would fall into about 4 out of 5.  The stuff I didn’t like isn’t enough to override all that I did like, so overall I really liked it and liked the story direction.  That said, the not so good stuff really isn’t very good.  Most people I talk to feel similarly. People who have seen it more than once tend to like it a little more than the first viewing.  That is how I felt about the Force Awakens.

The internet and the increasing displays of ego insecurity is really making me take note and have gratitude that my own opinions/values/likes/dislikes/etc are not so dependent on outward validation or popular vote. 

I've also never decided to see or not see a movie based on audience scores nor professional critics. I usually have made up my mind just upon hearing the concept. Have I been burned a few times?

The character potrayal of Luke Skywalker, who is arguarbly the most important character of the Star Wars franchise , was awful, the Fin/Rose storyline was useless, Poe Dameron's character seemed like a dick in the movie due to the admiral's unlogical secrecy/plothole and a lot of the potential from the clifhangers of Force Awakens, were ultimately unused.

How many people are asnwering? Maybe they should ask more people, not sure, but they definitely need to change this, because as it stands, The Last Jedi has the same level of enjoyment as Monster Trucks. I've struggled to see an F, or even a D or C, most of the grades are A to B, there needs to be a higher gap between some movies.",-0.6584,156

5 Why Snoke who can managed Jedis Minds (Kylo and Ren) don t see and feel the Kylo mind , and cant read Hux mind in beggining?

Finding other jedi. 

  It was just a big fu to fan lore. Which lore makes it even more fun for us fans. Look at Game of thrones and the fun of unraveling who John Snow was? That was what needed to be done. And instead we were left with nothing but an empty plot. That is why we did not like this!",0.4493,138

"OK...for the last time.  RJ swung for the fences and struck out to many of us fans.  I think the movie was a good movie, but at it's heart it is no longer STAR WARS.  Luke would NEVER consider the MURDER of his nephew.  For those of you who spout this ""moment of weakness"" garbage and then use the lightsaber dual with Vader in RotJ as your example of precedent are missing the whole point of why luke was there in the first place.  He was willing to risk ALL for the glimmer of light he saw in his father.  So now RJ wants us to believe that Luke would risk his very foundation and dedication to the light and MURDER his nephew because he senses a rising darkness.  C'mon man.  MAKES NO SENSE.  LAZY writing that critics are calling a bold choice because they agree with the in your face PROGRESSIVE, men are weak, women are strong, and everyone gets a trophy (uses the force) millennial BS.  Puhleeease  this is why I cant watch the NFL anymore.  JJA and the FA was a MUCH closer to the heart of STAR WARS film than this turd RJ just laid.  That's why Disney has already given him the keys to the next trilogy because Dysney loves the choices he made.  Here is to JJ to try and fix this train wreck.",-0.9932,254
"Of couse it is.. those are the 2 platforms you can make multiple acc's and vote regardless if you saw a movie. RT and Meta have been reviewing since the 1990's and at the same time BOTH companies had 2 change their user acc systems to prevent the same IP addresses being able to make multiple accounts.  

BVS and SS led to THOUSANDS of acc's from repeat IP addresses and the only activity on these was to give the max score to DC movies - and go thru Marvel movies 1 by 1 giving the lowest score possible. CinemaScore/PostTrack all have the movie around A or 89% .. critic scores are about the same.. box office is performing just like the critic / CinemaScore / Post track scores.

"The top 50 ""most helpful"" reviews on IMDB total to 88/500.  (Edit:  That is an average of 1.76/10)  People that bother to write reviews that are then voted on.  I would expect bots to slam down the overall rating, not marking ""bad reviews"" as helpful.

Phantom Menace has A- on cinemascore.  People walking out with immediate reactions, before any amount of thought can interfere, can give vastly different reactions to people after a car ride home talking over the movie with fellow moviegoers.  I find it difficult to say The Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises are equally good, despite both having an A on cinemascore.

All three of the scores mean something.  Cinemascore means most people that went to see the movie were happy walking out.  (My friend and I both chose not to go see it on release, despite our mutual love of Star Wars, so people that saw TFA and previews for this and decided not to go obviously will not contribute to the scores, along with my aforementioned point of no time spent thinking about the film, meaning plot holes are given far less weight.)  Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB both mean that someone bothered to take the time to issue that review.  It means there is some amount of dislike for the film from people that use RottenTomatoes.  How well founded that dislike is may be brought in to question, but somebody bothered to get online and downvote the film.  If you want to blame bots, then somebody had to write the code for that.  That takes even more effort than a lone troll saying a movie sucks.  Those low scores means people went through the effort of saying TLJ was a bad movie.  Incidentally, 3 months later, both RT and IMDB audience scores have dropped.  There has to be a driving force behind people organizing to downvote a movie.  It can be racism; It can be sexism; It can be a dislike of perceived forced diversity that some will call racism or sexism; It can be the movie isn't very good.  Regardless, people take actions for a reason, and the more effort put in to an action, typically the more powerful the reason.",-0.9698,417
