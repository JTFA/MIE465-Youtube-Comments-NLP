Nathalie Ferreira Diamandis no its not. It was in 2017. Why you think this was released by that time?,-0.296,22
Nathalie Ferreira Diamandis ok but still. The instruments are probably way older then you. Like the old piano during the all alone sequence. The music is different from ours. Just like spanish and american music. Or american and french music. They are all different. Shes a english singer.,0.6808,56
