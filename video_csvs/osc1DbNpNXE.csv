Ken Ward nothing meant to cause offense. I was just stating that most younger persons want more of a contemporary feel. And I was just trying to state that I crave for this style over the faster and contemporary style. What I love is that it's quality in sound and in lyric. Not an empty song about pick up trucks and skin tight clothing on some southern beauty. I hate empty music of all styles. So I was just trying to show contrast between the average person my age and the beauty of this style that I appreciate. I do agree with you people of all ages can and should enjoy quality music. I consider Stapletons music to be a higher standard than most  songs currently on the modern country radio stations. Personal I find myself more inclined to listen to stations like duke fm. They play Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash and the Judds etc... I look forward to hearing more from Stapleton. I feel it's much needed in an increasingly crazy world we are living in.,0.9429,191
"LYRICS

Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doin' too good
Me and him should wait in line
Just can't seem to find the time
But I love my life
Man it's, something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's all right
Everything goes wrong
It's a sound of a slow, simple song
Finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
I'm tryin' to quit these cigarettes 
I can't seem to kick 'em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And then I got high cholesterol
But I love my life
Man it's, something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's all right
Everything goes wrong
It's a sound of a slow, simple song
But I love my life
Man it's, something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's all right
Everything goes wrong

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
