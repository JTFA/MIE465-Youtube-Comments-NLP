"Congrats!  also - thank you... I haven't watched your videos for a while however, loved to see you announced number 4!! Woohoo!...   With your vlog today it has clarified how I've been feeling these past 5 years - as a new Mum, I have felt like a 'child' on just not knowing stuff.  Emotionally then mentally it has taken a toll on me - I am not the person I was before kids.  I can't do everything - full time work, housework and raise a children.    I burnt out in mid-2017 - I resigned from my full time work with no plan but to just stay alive and be a mum to my two gorgeous little boys and best friend & wife to my lovely, handsome husband.  I haven't sobbed for a while and your vlog for me today has given me that 'aha' moment...  Thank you  ^_^",0.9923,171

"Hi, first of all, massive congratulations on your pregnancy! I remember you saying in the past, you only want two children, lol, don't know when you changed your mind, but it's nice that you did. 
I have been watching your videos for over 5 years, I have a daughter who is nearly same age as Emilia and second daughter who is nearly same age as Alessia. I have an umbilical hernia and apparently I might also have IBS at the same time (doctors are not sure about that until I will have hernia sorted). It was caused during second pregnancy but they didn't picked that up at 8 week check up.....I have terrible tummy pains every other day if not every day, especially in afternoons and evenings, I can't lift anything heavy.....I feel you when you talk about energy for other children etc....it's also hard to stay on top of housework or other things needing to be done. My belly looks often like when I was 6 months pregnant or more....it's horrible. And I don't even have a baby inside....have been suffering since ever baby number two was born....could ever hardly enjoy her....It's just like being pregnant apart of that fact I am not pregnant. During my second pregnancy I felt just like you now and I couldn't wait when baby is out and I thought I will finally make it up to my older daughter....it's terrible that I feel like literally I never stopped being pregnant even after labour. So I am not back to myself at all. So it's not only pregnancies but also health issues holing us back to be mums we would like to be and I still try my best to be there for my children but it's nowhere nearby how much I would like to be with them....I do look after them but can't play with them much. I also need to go back to work for a part time and not sure how I will manage that. Hopefully I will have an operation soon and it will be sorted but obviously it will be hard again during recovery....At least you will have a baby in the end. I really hope so and wish you that everything goes well from bottom of my heart. Just watch out for hernia, it's quite common apparently and it gets much worse by the time. I didn't know I had and was lifting up and carrying even my older daughter as I had no clue. Just don't feel bad as children still loves us and they need much less attention then we think they do....loving mums always feel like we should spend more time with them, doing something nice, but children are often happy just to share a space, or knowing mummy is upstairs sleeping.....while daddy is with them....they are happy until they know you are still at home with them. I feel very bad myself so I know excactly how you feel but honestly they don't perceive it same way....and we will make it up to them as soon as we can! As long as they know they are still loved by you.....at least try to do a story time with them if you can or something very little each day....you will feel so much better from it....
By the way we are not planning more children because of few reasons, if we could we would want 3 children but because of health, age, space and money we couldn't afford it most likely and would be having it very hard and it would take away from our very loved 2 daughters. But I can understand if you are young as you are and financially sorted, why not to have lots of children....it's lots of work though! Hope you feel better soon! xxx",0.998,709

I lost my first at 31 weeks along it was so hard but I feel I loss is a loss no matter how far along u r. Because the second you find out your pregnant your life is altered and you picture this new life and when that baby dies it's like someone just stoled that life from you. I went on to get pregnant second 9 months later we tried for him the first was by accident. Then after I had my son I found out I was pregnant again only 3 months post partum I was so shocked. I was so tired and sick and had a baby to care for I rested every second I got. You have 3! Plus you are pregnant! You are intitled to sleep and rest all you can screw the haters.  Now I am 14 weeks pregnant with a 2 and 3 year old and exhausted.  It's true even though this is #3 after my loss I'm still terrified not have my Dr find a heart beat.

"Okay for uneducated people.... breastfeeding is commonly known as a “natural contraception” you usually don’t get pregnant again while breast feeding. Yes it happens, but it’s not too common. So people bagging her out and whatever need to stop. So what she’s pregnant again? They can support their children, and their children are happy and healthy.
And of course any unexpected pregnancy is going to be a shock... even if you want kids a positive test is gonna be a shock! So just stop with the bullshit for once in your lives... people really don’t need your negativity ffs... so grow a pair and go worry about your own life and if you get pregnant ✌️",-0.4574,139

lol i am a mom of two and I feel like a kid :D,0.8531,14
"marie kr What? Sorry but no parent or a single mom is not going to stop having kids just to make your life better. Apparently by your comment, you hate children. Kids are our future. And Ann is very happy with herself! She has a wonderful marriage and three (soon to be four) beautiful children, women don't have babies because they're not happy with their own lives. Don't know where you got that sick and demented negative thought, but sadly you hate kids. Too bad, babies will never stop being born! So get over it and no one is going to stop just for you! Aparantly you're not a mom or else you wouldn't have made your comment. Don't worry about Anna or don't be mad at her, and she is a beautiful lady and very happy...Too bad you can't be for her.",0.7545,163

one of the best piecees of advice i have ever gotten is to not worry about what other people think of you because you cannot be in control of how they feel or what they say. its all theit=r decision and its best to just not worry about it.,0.9218,53
"so happy for you! and omg I'm speechless by hearing how it was your last pregnancy with people contacting your doctor, WHAT is wrong with people!???? that's really sick, you deserve your privacy! love you, hope everything goes as good as it can and that you will have another healthy lovely baby <3333",0.9488,63
