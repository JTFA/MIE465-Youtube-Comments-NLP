"Hey NF,
Your not going to get the chance to read this, but you are literally the only reason I was alive. For the past 3 months I have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, along with suicidal thoughts. I was about to hang myself until one of my friends texted me telling me to listen to this song. I was amazed. Then 2 weeks ago my parents took me to the ER, where they transferred me to a mental hospital, it was very boring, and I had nothing to do, and once again I was thinking about killing myself. But then someone told me that they would print out music lyrics for you. I asked first your songs and I learned to rap them and I could hear your voice when I rapped it. Thank you so much for all that you have done, remember that when you get hate, you can think about cases like me where God put your music in my life and now I am still living.",-0.9476,190

"Look, people ask me what the future is
All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are moving quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that‚Äôs how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me, that makes two of us
Time change, yeah, I can't adjust
Yo, it‚Äôs who you are not who you was, oh my
Yeah, just went to Europe, they said the single is working
I think I'm learning, I am way more than people might think when they look on the surface
What is my purpose? Yeah
That is a question that I have been asking myself and it hurts
'Cause it's prolly something I should already know but I don‚Äôt know it yet
I'm tryna grow as a person, woo!
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketing dollars, oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
I got my hands in everything, now they out here tryna get to me
Stop tryna lecture me
You don't compare to my level of thinking, so why do you think you compare to my energy, huh?
Small circle, but the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm like, ""How you doin'?""
Hung up on him, I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talking, I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Y'all judgin', but we not in court, no, we not in court, oh Lord!
Last couple years, let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me, I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at 83
I've been doin' this since ABC's
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Parked, then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!
Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don‚Äôt smile in VIPs, you get mad like, ""You know what I paid?""
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I leave it all on the stage",-0.9366,764
