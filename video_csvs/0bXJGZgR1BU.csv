"#1. Screw the committee for taking most of the TV revenue.

#2. Only countries that know what they're doing should be allowed to host.

I live in South Korea and the games were a success here. Other than the excitement the Olympics brought, infrastructure was improved and new facilities were made.

And though the Olympics are gone, the country will continue to make good use of all the new construction as they did for the '88 Olympics, '02 World Cup, '14 Asian Games.",0.91,99

"Easy to implement solutions:

Cut down on the number of events, or sort them into 2 lists: a list of compulsory events and a list of optional events. From the optional list, host cities have the freedom to choose which events they would like to stage. This will prevent the building of unique venues that may not have a use afterwards.

Utilize existing and temporary venues whenever possible. Both Los Angeles and Paris‚Äô bids for the 2024/2028 Summer Olympics are utilizing this to their full potential. Create temporary venues that can be easily dismantled once they're done.

The Summer and Winter Universiades are the second biggest international sporting event behind the Olympics and FISU, the organization that runs them, don‚Äôt suffer from any of these problems mentioned. The IOC could learn a lot from FISU in order to avoid setbacks and the media scrutiny that goes along with it.

Saudi Arabia, United Arab Eremites and Qtar need to improve their work labor conditions. India also needs to improve their economy to afford the games especially with many people in India being poor similar to Brazil.
