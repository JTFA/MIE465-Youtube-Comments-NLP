"$10-20 dollars for replacement for the cardboard parts? I've seen kits like that where you assemble high quality/sturdy cardboard items (You can get desks, chairs, etc.). The kits without any electronics or complicated pulley/gear systems would cost around $30-50.  So, the game cartridge is probably only about $10-15 of the cost of the whole kit. 
 That means that we can expect the individual controller replacement kits to be $20 for something like the handlebars, and more like $35 for the  piano or fishing rod. I don't even want to speculate on the robot kit.",0.7413,116

Pretty much everyone that wanted a Switch has one now, so they need another big market to buy their console. Kirby and Yoshi will come out soon, which will appeal to both markets.

It's a smart strategy, they have two unique demographics of gamers that like playing Nintendo games, and family/kids, separate markets than trying to get gamers that would most likely just get a 3rd party game on their PS4 Pro or Xbox One X.¬†

Durability wise, sure it's cardboard, but show your kids (or yourself), how to handle it more carefully, just like I'm sure you've shown them how to handle carrying the Switch around etc.   

The onus is not on Nintendo to show the user how to treat products responsibly, they are giving the consumer an avenue and opportunity for a new experience, and while it may not be for everyone, there is a market and a demographic that will really enjoy this.  Just like how people think the next COD or Battlefield is innovative, I just see another game that has you chasing a dot in the middle of the screen.  If you don't like it, don't ruin it for others, and no one said you have to buy it, and no one said that this is what Nintendo has poured all of its time and resources to. There is going to be more ""Gamer"" stuff later this year so chill.

And you also have to admit that it's got a lot of people using their brains just a little more.  A lot of 'does it really work?', and 'how is this actually working?', type reactions all over and it's great.
