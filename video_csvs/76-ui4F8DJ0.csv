It's probarbly too strong of a competition to other would be setups but that just shows how well managed Marvel has been.

"12:00 I don’t think the DCEU needs to be rebooted. However, I do think the Snyder movies need to be retconned out. They definitely need to be discarded, and can be, without throwing out Wonder Woman and Aquaman. And they can do so right away, and then explain it away with Flashpoint. If it were up to me, they’d do the following:

- Cut any ties between the new Aquaman movie and Justice League so that there aren’t any clear continuity links between the two
- Make the Matt Reeves Batman movie clearly set in a separate universe, with a younger Bruce Wayne earlier in his career but set in the modern day (I still can’t fathom what Warner Bros. was thinking when they decided to make a cinematic universe, and then took their most popular character, Batman, and chose to put him at the end of his career. That’s incredibly poor foresight)
- Continue with the plans to make Wonder Woman 2 set in the past (Thankfully, that makes it incredibly easy to divorce both movies from the current DCEU, as they’d be set well before any Flashpoint event)
- Once you’ve established these characters as being part of a different continuity, use the upcoming Flashpoint movie to explain why this new continuity exists (And give Flash a proper costume. He shouldn’t be wearing an armored suit)
- Introduce a new Superman. One who’s hopeful, inspiring, wears bright colors (and red trunks), and who has parents who wouldn’t have given him sociopathic advice as he was growing up (Why in the world did anyone at Warner think it was a good idea to have a Superman movie where Pa Kent tells a young Clark that he should’ve let a bus load of children drown to death? I mean, what the hell?!?). And particularly, one who always finds a way to triumph without killing his opponent

Do that, THEN do a Justice League movie, which will be their first official retconned meeting. In that way you get to keep Gadot, Momoa, and Miller, while ejecting Affleck’s murderous and aged Batman and Cavill’s dour and constipated Superman.",0.9776,430

"@John Campea I dont know how you like the current DCEU films but if u could explain that would be great. I think WW was a good movie but over hyped and I think that justice league along w BvS deserved the ratings they got. I think the blame should go to WB and Zach Snyder, for one Zach Snyder just isn't a good director, he tries to make every scene a visual art piece but fails putting together a good movie. He also uses a ton of CGI and green screen which I dont like personally. Personally I think the hype for justice league was killed off when BvS came out, because it turned out to be a piece of crap, also it was pretty obvious that superman would return. IDK why WB keeps using Zach Snyder but if you could explain that to me that would be great as well, I saw that he's scheduled to direct JL , except I don't understand why the studio keeps giving him chances.",0.9851,183

"As Kevin Feige has said, a million times:  ""The Answers are in the Books.  Always.""
Don't just re-boot.  Do a DC ""Comics"" Line-Wide re-visioning.  As in: REVISE YOUR TIMELINE.
First:  No more Snyder direction of superheroes.  Let him direct his own films (and file away for later, when he will be the perfect fit for the Cosmic flick: ""LOBO"")

2nd:  Have Bat-fleck star in 1 film, where - planning his retirement ( to 'hang his cowl') he recollects his younger years as a heroic, RE-CAST Batman - in his Prime.  Give us 1 full movie to absorb & care about this actor depicting this super-smart, strategic, crime-fighting, Detective Comics- Style BATMAN.  & Let Affleck retire (Logan-style).

Then, Your timeline is *Now* sound to have Barry meet a Younger Batman (instead of Thomas Wayne) when trying to prevent his own mother's death, in ""Flashpoint"" (or flashpoint pt. 2).  I *still think* Barry could use a solo movie, before you go all Flashpoint on us, but whatever.  You have So Many Choices.  Use them & do  what a great comics story arc would do.

Thus:  Bring Younger Batman to the remixed, combined future, where he is the one & only Batman existing on that ""re-envisioned"" timeline for Earth.  Viola!  Regular aged, re-cast Batman can join a regular, timeless & Iconic Justice League.  Future & Past fold together, creating 1 single Present.

Comics Fans & general audiences will understand it, because they already have seen it  (Back to the Future, anyone?) - and have accepted re-castings of Batman & Superman already many times, to this day. 

From there:  Go Bananas.   

Look - the CW has given us convincing depictions of : Deathstroke, Gorilla Grodd, STARRO, King Shark, INVASION!,  Earth X, CRISIS , etc.

Don't hold back!  Give us:  BIZARRO!  ,  Mr. Miracle & Barda !,  ORION (!)  and make him fight (drumroll ... )   .... the Main Main, himself:  LOBO.

Thus:  Snyder is written into your future plans, for a Tremendous, Tonally PERFECT Comeback (!)  (Seriously - Snyder & Lobo could be 100% Perfection for a Lobo movie.  If not - then give him SPAWN, goddammit.  Or Hell - give him BOTH ! )

Everybody wins.

We are ALL rooting for you, DC / WB.   We all want you to have 10 years of back-up plans, utilizing your ENTIRE Library of characters, instead of only relying on Superman & Batman, over & over again.

I want ETRIGAN.  MR. MXYZPTLK ! ! !  BAT-MITE  ! ! !   And if you're doing Darkseid - there can be No Apokalips without Mr. Miracle, Barda, Orion and Etrigan (!)

And you know what?  Give us a god-damned quality SWAMP THING MOVIE already, while you're at it.

The DC Universe is your Oyster.

"Batman and SUperman are known, the others,not so much. Kids don't get Wonder WOman or Flash or Aquaman etc toys outside of USA,not until now anyway. Most kids only saw superman or batman as kids. I saw the great 1992 Batman animated series, the 1994 Spidey etc ones, but none of my friends here in Europe (and those I've spoken to in America)even heard of Fantastic Four or Iron Man or Hulk etc even(not until the 2003-2005 movies came), only somewhat popular cartoons of the 80s,90s and 00s at the time were Biker Mice from Mars,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Beetle Borgs, Samurai Cats , Go-bots, Tom and Jerry, Smurfs, Scooby-Doo and also Care bears. That's roughly the top 10 aside from SUperman,Batman and Spider-Man. Even X-men were unknown to mostly all of my generation here in Europe, I was the only weirdo watching them in the mid90s on fox kids. And what I'm saying is that Batman and Superman are DC yes, but in the 00s more of my peers I asked knew of X-men than SUperman(and this is because the Superman cartoon was never that popular in the 90s,and the old movies were long forgotten by the time milennials were old enough to watch cartoons.

The word ''Justice League'' means as little to most as ''Avengers''. It just isn't established outside the core geek fanboys, I've spoken to people,from kids to adults in their 40s, and almost nobody knows anything about Justice League, they just know Batman,who is by far more popular than Superman among most. Spider-man edges out Supes,popularity wise, and the movie numbers confirm this over and over of course. We have 10 films featuring Batman now over the last 30 years, including 2 successful Batman cartoon series. and by July 2021 we will have 11 movies featuring Spider-Man in less than 20 years. Superman has had 4 films with him in the last 30 years, peaking with Man of Steel,which had little to no competition and did as well as a Superman movie can manage. And they didn't even market Superman at all in this film. Batman wasn't liked by many in the last film, different from Nolan's Batman. So...we see the results.
And just because a few people played Batman video games doesn't mean even all of them will rush out to see the film at a cinema. Gaming is a different platform, why go see it when you can PLAY it.",0.9893,486

There was also an older Thor cartoon. And the popular Hulk tv show in the 80s. Fantastic Four film in the 94. Captain america had multiple appearances on these 90s cartoons but also a movie with him in 1990 i think. The 1990 tv show ""the flash"" also ran then on tv.

"Godly Trey you dont understand the first thing about the film business and how finances are spent and earned it seems. And as far as narrative structure, editing and script, justice league was horrible. Only actors dynamic was good for most part( aquaman was completely forgettable and boring). Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 and several others were just as horrible. And Marvel does comedies, no stakes, there is no tension in them, unlike Logan, Dark Knight trilogy, punisher, even first spider-man films, some x-men films too. The Wolverine 2013 etc.Man of Steel was good.


Avengers was a huge joke, iron man and cap measuring d**ks when Fury clearly said got short time to save humanity and got to go now!! They continued arguing. Sociopathic narcissists..not heroes! You cant take those films seriously..slapstick corny cheesy films. 90s cartoons were much better with all the marvel cartoons like hulk, fantastic four, iron man, batman, superman, x-men, spidey etc. 

Justice league 70s cartoon even. Firat Thor and Iron Man were Paramount pictures produced. Since 2012 disney and its formulaic copy-paste. Go watch "" honest trailers"" for doctor strange. Copy or iron man. Bland and predictable. Thor 3 was good mindless fun cause it knew it was a comedy and so it was enjoyed as one. 

Adam Sandler comedy with action basically. Justice league tried to be comedy? Failed badly. Tried to be serious? Failed badly. Horrible script and villain and execution. Even the godawful suicide squad was better, but barely.script wise.acting in there was bad for some.

"I hated BvS. I at least enjoyed my time with Justice League and feel that it was a course correction and is starting to head in a good direction. I have my doubts about a hard reboot and agree with Midnight's Edge that a hard reboot might fail. Sure it worked ok for Spiderman, but Spiderman's reboot was a bit different. He was rebooted as a guest character in a bigger film. The hard reboot of Spiderman with Garfield didn't really last long either. You got to Amazing Spiderman 2 before the plug was pulled yet again. 

With WW and Aquaman already in production, those films should retain the continuity. I also agree with Midnight's edge that WB and DC should forget about Batgirl, Shazam, Suicide Squad 2, Gotham City Sirens. DC needs to fix their brand and solidifying their core assets. (WW, Batman, and Superman). Follow up Wonder Woman 2 and Aquaman with a Superman 2. Don't call it MoS 2 to distance it from the divisive MoS and BvS. Then follow that with a solo Flash, Cyborg, and Green Lantern. Have a solo batman prequel trilogy with a younger actor then recast Affleck and bring him into JL2. 

Who is to say that a hard reboot wouldn't be just as much of a broken mess? As long as they keep the same management/people involved at the corporate/executive level, the hard reboot will end up being another Amazing Spiderman 2. Of course continuing the current DCEU with those same people will reap the same results.

I think Midnight's Edge also made a great video discussing why so many 'cinematic universes' fail. As he points out, when Iron Man and Hulk came out, Marvel didn't announce that they were creating a cinematic universe. They also kept the links between films subtle at first. They focused on making great movies that could be seen cold and they did that by getting the audience invested in at least one of the characters. Yet DC and even Universal's monster universe were launched by touting they would be a part of a cinematic shared universe.",0.9545,394
"I have to disagree with the Thor movie helping the Justice League movie from just a logical standpoint. Other than movie critics, most people don’t go to the movies very often, and when they do, it’s usually bad to have a superior movie as competition when deciding. That goes for all businesses as well: if a world famous candy shop opens up next to yours and yours has not been doing well, people will go for the better if all factors are the same, which in this case is.",0.7845,102
"I just don't know if I buy the idea of WB messing up by not putting Superman in the ads or putting Batman upfront in the marketing. Lots of critics talked about how what WB should do (and they seemed to do) is put Wonder Woman in the marketing since it did so well, but obviously that didn't translate into a better opening weekend. My thing is, ok even if people didn't show up because Batman wasn't marketed heavily in the ads or even if Superman wasn't hidden before the film came out (btw, I don't recall anyone complaining about WB not showing Superman in the ads prior to the movie's release), they know by now!!! Let's not forget, it's THE JUSTICE LEAGUE!!! As John has stated many times, that Holy Trinity is probably the most recognizable comic book characters of all time. Regardless of opening weekend, this movie should have better legs cause the people that didn't show up before, should've shown up by now. The reason Justice League is not doing as well as we thought it should is because on a large scale, the public wasn't as interested in this movie as they were for past DC films. Now we can all speculate as to those reasons - no good word of mouth, bad taste left from BvS, not enough women showed up, etc., but I really think it has very little to do with how the film was marketed.",0.8815,273
"I know how to perfectly fix all of this in the first place get Zack Snyder to only do Man Of Steel 1 and then do solo films to set up characters for Justice League and embolden the crest on Superman and give him bright red and blue and yellow make the original suit and go ahead and slightly layer it and add some details and make it look a little complex if you want and you know what! Fuck it! Please reboot it! 

I remember as a little kid loving the flash and hoping DC would have hope in his struggle and his charm but as I grew older a new movie came out called The Avengers and I was blown away and that finally told those stupid WB rich retards if fucking Thor can be made into a movie then Jesus Christ Flash obviously could but no we’re watching another DC movie franchise go dark gritty and realistic and I thought to myself that this clashes with The Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Superman and all of their respective tones but I sighed still not seeing a proper Flash film as the “DCEU” grew I grew bored and tired... please just reboot it",0.9285,216

I'd focus on fastracking a Man of Steel 2 (with this more hopeful version with Henry Cavill), get going on Matt Reeves' The Batman, and making sure Wonder Woman 2 is great. And just so you know things are still connected, maybe in The Batman movie Cyborg makes a cameo to help Bruce out, or we see a scene in Man of Steel 2 with Clark reaching out to Bruce for something, but he's too busy to help cause he's out of the country fighting The League of Assassins. I think light crossovers to show that connectivity from Justice League still exists while expanding the main core of heroes would give the DCEU more of a stable ground to then go off and do a Flash film, Batgirl film, Gotham City Sirens film, etc.",0.9687,195

"It's not overly difficult to figure out why the DCEU is failing. DCEU movies have all been mediocre to really bad and you can only rely so much on a character's fan base for a movie to be successful. You have to draw out the people who are ""sort of"" comic book fans and those that don't really care about superheroes, but will see a good movie. Those who are borderline or don't really care about superheroes don't want to spend $10-$15 on a bad movie.

In regards to a reboot, I think that is what they need to do. The problem is where do they start? I think they should take some time off from the whole DCEU thing. General audiences are no longer willing to put money down on a bad movie just because Superman or Batman is in it. The JL has proven that.

The other thing is I would not start with a Superman or Batman because general audiences have to be tired of them due to over exposure in the last 10 years. The most recent movies with those characters in it have been so bad that they will be back to square one with a formula that hasn't worked - expect DC fans to come out and hope that our characters are popular enough to get other bodies out there.

However, I doubt a reboot will happen though because WB wants to compete with Marvel now. They are just going to chunk out more DCEU movies and hope one of those catch lightening in a bottle. How they think going ahead with Man of Steel 2 after the 1st one was pretty much garbage and basically broke even doesn't make any sense. I can't imagine movie audiences are excited about another Batman movie in the near future if he is presented in a similar fashion to the current incarnation and making an Aquaman or Flash movie, after the colossal failure of JL, is really ballsy and stupid.

I just see WB as too stupid to take their pedal off the gas when something isn't working. They like tripping over themselves and falling flat on their faces.",-0.988,390

BvS took huge risks by retrofitting a mixed received standalone movie into a cinematic universe and skipping straight to their version of Civil War with a murderous Batman we knew nothing about.

"MCU began it's first 5 movies using characters not guaranteed to be successful. Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America were getting their first mainstream introductions to the general audiences and Hulk was coming of off Ang Lee's terrible adaptation. Additionally within these first 5 were 4 solo movhe's and one sequel. The DCEU once again used already established and proven money makers in Batman coming off No man's amazing trilogy, Superman, and the Joker to sell MOS, BvS, and SS not to mention having the most famous female Superhero and the one of the most famous niche characters in Harley Quinn. Add to that the first 5 DCEU movies consisted of 2 solo and 3 team/crossover films. I would be less worried about throwing the numbers of the first five out and worry about the interest in the DCEU going forward. Since the MCU's first 5 movies the universe has exploded both financially and culturally. MCU has 4 $1 Billion + dollar movies and will most likely have 5th in May when Infinity War comes out. Even after 17 movies the momentum is still going strong. Meanwhile the DCEU Avengers killer is about to make less than Dr. Strange? With more shakeup coming from WB? How many times have you heard anyone seriously ask if the MCU should be rebooted? How many Ultimate/Extended editions of Marvel films have you seen get petitions because people weren't happy with what they got from them? How many major shakeup and changes in direction have you heard coming out of Marvel.

To reboot the DCU you absolutely start with a Batman film but you absolutely have to also make a Superman film and show that theyre both happening in the same universe. You then take Lex Luthor and make him an evil version of Tony Stark. You give him his power suit from the comics. You have him as the main villain in the first superman film and you use him to set up Metallo as villain in the second film. By the third film you bring in Batman in a team up film which is a first step toward Justice League. In the Batman trilogy id make it a murder mystery with Victor Tzsaz as the main villain but make so that theres a deeper conspiracy that involves the court of owls with the threat of the joker looming in the background. The second film you bring in the joker and Harley with Deathstroke and Penguin as supporting villains. In the third film you bring in Robin and Catwoman to help Batman face the Suicide Squad where you can really bring in some villains that can help expand the universe.,-0.9922,198

And we had Falcon, Nick Fury, Rhodes/War Machine, BLack Panther, Blade, Heimdall(Thor movies),Catwoman(Halle Berry), Storm(X-men), Luke Cage as black superheroes, just to name you 9 more, so you're out of the loop of the last 15 years of comic book films +...who cares?! It doesn't matter what amount of melanin one has, why are you shoehorning Cyborg's pigmentation as anything noteworthy in and of itself ? It is not. THe only thing that matters is if the character was effective, and to me, just like Aquaman, he was a forgettable character. I could care less if Aquaman is white or not, he wasn't all that, script was bad imo.  This whoe forcing a quota of women and blacks/asians into college or workforce when men or whites,whatever the case may be, may have better qualifications/basis/education to get the job/position,and yet denied application due to being a MALE or white is totalitarian tyranny,in government and business organizations alike, and that in itself is sexism and racism. We should worry about the tyrannical LAWS that have been put in place in the past decade,not if we get a minority in a film.

It's you who don't understand film business if you think Marvel doesn't take any risks. They took a massive risk with GotG in 2014, after Disney bought Marvel studios by making a movie really isolated from Avengers with a group of ragtag heroes not even comic book fans cared about. Again they took a risk with Ant Man. A D grade hero no one had heard about before. And again with Dr.Strange. A nobody comic book hero among general audience with no previous introduction in MCU movie before. And this all happened with Disney behind Marvel. 

Honest Trailers used to be fun AND intelligent in the past but in recent years, they are just shit fests that insult their audience by droning on obvious facts that casual moviegoer could get but they couldn't. If you want to find some example that marvel has a copy paste method, DO BETTER.

You seems to think movies with dark tone as good or think they have high stakes ( what was at stake in Man of Steel other than Superman's beloved character by the way?). But that's your personal opinion. The box office for MCU movies shows that there are 15 people to every one of you. So marvel shouldn't even bother about the red book species like you. 

You shouldn't even think about making a business decision if you think Infinity war is only going to make 1.4 billion after the success of the recent movies. Even solo Marvel movies that came out last year all came close to cracking 1 billion mark.

But most of all, No offense to Zack Snyder. But it is time for him to no longer be involved in futher DCEU movies. I want directors who are FANS of DC greatest superheros.

To be fair none of the heroes actually had a point once superman showed up. They made him WAY too powerful for this team movie. 

I mean we've proven that the heroes in a team up do not need to be of equal power levels. In Avengers you have Hawkeye and Thor on the same team, and Hawkeye doesn't feel useless.

Also Bruce Wayne has more or less the same powers as Tony Stark (Super Smarts and lots of cash), while also being peak physical fitness and near-superhuman strength before factoring in power armour... which we know he has from BvS when he fought Superman, and he knows bad stuff is coming and has time to prepare for it.

"that is not why it failed. I watched it twice, but I admit, it was botchy, it was edited together sloppily, sub-par direction, cinematography was mostly forgettable aside from couple scenes, visual effects were atrocious, villain was utterly forgettable ,much like the BatmanvsSuperman ''abomination copy''(the Hulk villain from 2008), the PS3 visual effects level, bleh. Only good thing about the films were the character dynamic, Aquaman underwhelmed me, Wonder Woman was again was the heart of it, SUperman was the soul of it. Batman was fine. Flash had his moments, Cyborg is forgettable. The film had a production budget too huge,marketing budget too huge. 500 million all together. So do the maths, studio gets 52% of local gross, and 38% of foreign total. So 225 mill from local gross,will be 115mil for studio, and 450 abroad, is 180mil, so studio gets 300mill total, and a loss of 200 million if it gets 700 mil.

"they did in fact rush to justice league. it's not the amount of movies (Marvel had more before Avengers btw) or the amount of years (DCEU had a 3 year gap with NOTING and delay of almost 1 year on BvS, so they spat out 4 movies in under 2 years!) that decide if they rushed it, *IT'S THE NARRATIVE CONTENT* that matters, and they in fact rushed the hell out of it. they had 3 of the 4 movies before Justice league in Man of Steel (which at the time of production and initial release was not intended as a shared universe movie, thus it set up nothing and had the biggest, baddest stakes in the whole DCEU in what wound up being the first movie), Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman that either didn't tie in to justice league or failed to build up the shared universe aspect at all. *EVERY MCU PHASE 1 MOVIE DID THIS.* the very first Iron Man had 4 scenes in the movie to introduce S.H.I.E.L.D. and the post credit scene gave us Nick fury and the *Avengers* initiative. every phase 1 served to further the same story line that led right into the forming of the Avengers as well as the main plot of the franchise with Infinity stone mcguffins. it's BS to say WB didn't rush to Justice League. that is a product of shallow, narrow minded, surface level thinking (because they had only one less movie in the same time span eh?).  it's a cop out to give them a pass they don't deserve. BvS was the only film to set up Justice league and that mess of a film tried to tackle what the entirety of the MCU's phase 1 did in a single film.",-0.5368,340

"you must be not aware of how tracking vs reality works often Robert, nowadays trailer hype does not reflect reality, not even studio tracking does, often studio tracking is much more than films make. Justice League was just one of the most recent examples of this. Infinity War will make,at best,very best, as much as Avengers 2(it will make more in China due to how much the market grew there,but remember that studio only gets 25% of whatever is made in China), as the novelty wore off,and a lot of people have been turned off from Downey's and Evans' comments regarding Trump leading up to the elections and subsequently when he won. This is why movies have majorly underperformed this year for the actors who upset half the country,big time,including Jen Lawrence, she's done financially if she opens her mouth again in the next few years.

Also,novelty gone, Deadpool 2 will steal much thunder from Infinity War. It just doesn't have a broad enough demographic appeal,especially foreign gross wise. It will easily make a billion,sure, but not 1.5-2bil, much like it was obvious Justice League would not make 1 billion long before it opened, it had too much lackluster demand,and the dismal numbers now proved that tracking, it did even worse than the tracking. If you check the most watched top10 trailers, you will see Thor: Ragnarok smashed records,and yet, it did nothing spectacular in the box office. So there goes your trailer statistic,Robert.

As John says, compared to your standard movie, JL did well...but we now have proof that the blockbuster crowd clearly isn’t following. I personally believe it’s the way these movies are written and executed. I see the whole thing as a massive disappointment- exciting cast, some great scenes, and many excellent trailers, but overall these movies just aren’t good. I’ve been disappointed by every DCEU release. The stories are lame and they can’t even fall back on humor like MCU because they are so obsessed with “being dark.” Top it off with ridiculous CGI endings we’ve seen 100 times before. Ive seen almost every comic book/massive budget release in theaters, opening weekend, in imax if available. I’ve been excited about every DCEU release and showed up for them all...except Justice League. I couldn’t care less. If it’s on Netflix next year for free and I’m bored one day, I’ll catch it then.
