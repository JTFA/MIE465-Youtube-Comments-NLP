"My life is great
I write then hit update
I turn you on
Wanna belong, so I go to the mall
And I buy it all

(All on) thank God it's the weekend
(My squad) got time we can waste it
(Don't know) should we drive to the sunset or the fire
(It's like) we live in a bubble pretending it's 'cause we are young

We are fucked
These days we only follow
These days we're feeling hollow
Get paid, the only motto
We are fucked
They say it all gets better
They say won't last forever
Then someone pulls the trigger
We are fucked

The fame, the fame
I want to hear my name
And I don't care what for
I'll change the world
Save all those trees and birds
But first I'll grab a starbucks then I'll get to work

(All on) thank God it's the weekend
(My squad) got time we can waste it
(Don't know) should we drive to the sunset or the fire
(It's like) we live in a bubble pretending it's 'cause we are young

We are fucked
These days we only follow
These days we're feeling hollow
Get paid, the only motto
We are fucked
They say it all gets better
They say won't last forever
Then someone pulls the trigger
We are fucked

We've got hearts in the right places
But we're still a danger to ourselves
Maybe it's 'cause we are young

Thank God it's the weekend
Should we drive to the sunset or the fire

We are fucked
These days we only follow
These days we're feeling hollow
Get paid, the only motto
We are fucked
They say it all gets better
They say won't last forever
Then someone pulls the trigger
We are fucked

We've got hearts in the right places
But we're still a danger to ourselves
Maybe it's 'cause we are young

"hey noah! i'm 49 freaking years old and i totally feel you....i just listened to this for the first time and how true...i have listened to Stay Together for the night....what i like about both songs is how straight forward they are no need to get all heavy in the lyrics the subjects are deep enough it seems you have a sense of your future bc you understand the reality of your present.....i think you are equiped with a good bullshit detector and see passed all the roles people become forced to play to fit into the various parts of their life but I'm more like why can't we be more real and genuine all the time regardless of the setting? I don't mean go tell your grandma ""I don't give a fuck"" I mean just be more reality based much of society (for lack of a better trite word) spends so much time trying to get ahead but what are they getting ahead to? nothing. I know this is idealistic {and dare I say trite for lack of a better work for trite} but things could be so much better if people just helped each other and didn't hide under layers of insecurities....keep up the good work and it is obvious you have a very loving and supporting family",0.9848,240
