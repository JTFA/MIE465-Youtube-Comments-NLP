Many writers get inspiration for their castles from our castles and fortresses here in Germany. Not only in Bavaria we have a lot of them, in fact we have over 20.000 castles throughout Germany. Neuschwanstein is just the most famous one that looks like it's from a fairy tale, but there are plenty more. Neuschwanstein is just around the corner from where i live. We also get the most tourists here, but i urge anyone who ever wants to travel and visit castles like this, there are so many more, often even close by to other ones especially along the Rhine River and on the ""Burgstraße"" in Bavaria",0.7351,122

Its special but there are lover 20.000 castles that we have here in Germany. I live arond the corner from this one so its not special to me because i grew up with it and playing in the woods around it but otherwise it's very special, otherwise there wouldn't be millions of tourists from all around the world coming here all around the year, especially in Winter when everything is white",0.9464,76

"It was built by the Bavarian eccentric homosexual King Ludwig II (25 August 1945 - 13 June 1886), who ruled the Kingdom of Bavaria from 1864 to 1886 and was one of the leading patronages of the German National Romanticism during the 19th Century. Richard Wagner was then his generously supported court composer. King Ludwig II of Bavaria build a lot of magnificent castles during his life. People in Bavaria commonly loved him though he spent a lot of money to those his fantasy castles and his cultural patronage projects, but he was an endless nightmare to his finance ministers, because his ambitious bombastic projects practically ruined the wealthy Bavarian state´s state finances. Ludwig II of Bavaria has been sometimes called the last traditional king in Europe, because he did just what he wanted, quite eccentric way. That is the romantic fairy tale fantasy side of German nationalism and German national romanticism. There was once too the ""dark side"", which loved Richard Wagner´s music too, lol :) Once upon time, in Europe.....",0.9869,195

"We visited it many times in summer and winter but you must visit it in winter. Imagine when you drive up there through a lane with old lights and it is snowing, white trees, horses, a frozen lake... After a walk of 45 min. uphill the castle appears. When the castle would have been finished it would be romantic beautiful. I prefer his castle Linderhof. It has a nice garden and the interior is all in theme of the swan. The yellow castle Hohenschwangau, on the opposite of Neuschwanstein, is older, inside a typical castle. You can visit both castles and the old town Füssen in one day. Ludwig II had also another castle Herrenchiemsee. He was a very romantic man. There are many beautiful castles but I think the romance, the story, the tragedy, the location makes Neuschwanstein so special.",0.9799,162
