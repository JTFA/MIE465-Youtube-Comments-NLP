"Computer-generated imagery¬†(CGI) is the application of¬†computer graphics¬†to create or contribute to images in¬†art, printed media,¬†video games, films,¬†television programs, shorts, commercials, videos, and¬†simulators. The visual scenes may be dynamic or static and may be two-dimensional (2D), though the term ""CGI"" is most commonly used to refer to¬†3D computer graphics¬†used for creating scenes or special effects in films and television. Additionally, the use of 2D CGI is often mistakenly referred to as ""traditional animation"", most often in the case when dedicated animation software such as¬†Adobe Flashor¬†Toon Boom¬†is not used or the CGI is hand drawn using a tablet and mouse.",0.9118,132
