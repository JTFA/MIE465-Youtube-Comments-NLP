At my Chinese college, they had to rows of stalls, half squatters half sitters. There was a long line going out of the bathroom to use the toilet during the break between classes. Once I got closer to the front, I noticed all the squatter stalls were empty. I asked the girls in front of me if they minded if I used those, they didn't and I went and had my pick of 5 different stalls :p",0.1027,128

(or someone elses...) forget using these toilets if you are even slightly over weight as well... big people might as well just sit on the floor... LOL....",0.75,153
