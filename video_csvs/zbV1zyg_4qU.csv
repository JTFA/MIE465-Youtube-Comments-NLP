"A 3kv dc rated cap will not survive 3kv ac tesla coil primary circuit voltage. Not even 6kv will last forever. I put three in series to create a 9kv cap which will literally last forever. The reduced capacitance allows for faster break rates, thus, more of a tesla coil effect. Also, the entire circuit is tuned to the exact build you see in the video.

"A tesla coil is much like any other precision invention out there, like an engine. Replace one piston with another piston not designed for that exact engine, the entire engine will sieze up, break, or explode. Same for guns. Bullets are designed for the specific barrel size. Put in one too small, it will hardly shoot. One too large, it will either not fit, or, your barrel with explode. This tesla coil is identical to all tesla coils in that every single part is calculated to fit in perfectly with the rest. That is how this one boosts 3 volts up to 30,000. Every part is in resonance. In harmony. Now, slightly different parts can be used, but they must be close. 120pF capacitors are exactly 1/10th the capacitance the coil calls for. That causes the primary circuit to have a frequency 10X as high as it should. Meaning, the entire coil system would be out of wack.

"Considering that the primary LC circuit isn't tuned to the secondary, better magnetic coupling is likely to make hotter arcs. It's not technically a Tesla Coil, as there isn't resonance happening in the secondary unless you were *very* lucky. Were it to be a resonant transformer and not just a step-up transformer, at these frequencies, you would probably still want a cylindrical coil rather than a pancake coil, but with fewer turns (as the extra inductance would probably lead to over-coupling for a coil with that resonant frequency and dimensions, which is likely very high around 4 MHz). My recommendation is that you leave off the topload for this transformer, and go for a point or wire breakout. You don't get any benefit from the capacitive loading unless it's oscillating, and it will hurt the output's ability to form streamers (you might actually get some freely breaking out without it)!",0.2434,169

"Liam, great input, thank you! However, it is in resonance. The number of turns and size of capacitor was experimented to create the largest spark. At 6.5 turns and 1.3 nF of capacitance, it creates the highest voltage. More than 6.5 turns, spark size is reduced. Lower than 6.5 turns, spark size is reduced. I didn‚Äôt show the tuning steps for this build, because I already did it when creating this design. The video was created for simplicity and a ‚Äòbuild it EXACTLY like this‚Äô type of video.

"My guess is that you've got it tuned roughly to the lower resonant pole of the secondary/topload combination, but the ideal tuning is directly in between the upper and lower resonant pole. (especially when you've got appropriate topload capacitance).

Doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations, your secondary coil alone sits at about a 2.7 MHz resonant frequency (although not knowing the number of turns, the wire gauge, coil length, or the turn spacing, it's hard to say exactly. Small changes in these parameters can vary the resonant poles wildly). With a primary capacitance of 1.3nF and a 6.5 turn coil with that geometry, you end up with about a 2.3 MHz resonant frequency for the primary side. These don't match, and the impedance of the top-load is most certainly too high, so I recommend removing it and experimenting with fewer turns on the primary, as you've got ballpark values.

Reproducing this coil ""exactly"" is a near impossible feat, as a lot of information is not given, but even if it were, it is unlikely that people would be able to match resonant frequencies just by copying what you had done. LC-systems are finicky and volatile beasts. 

Here's a link to a Tesla Coil calculator: http://www.classictesla.com/java/javatc/javatc.html, which is very good at giving you close-to-perfect values. Tuning is of course a must!",0.9714,252

"So that is a 2Kv, 22nF (.022uF) capacitor. Good bang, but such high capacitance, your break rate (individual pulses across the spark gap) will be low. Will lead to more powerful sparks in the end though, just lower pulse rate.


The 28 gauge is not optimal, but will definitely do, as long as it is enamel covered. If you can, try a 4.5 inch secondary, instead of 4 inch secondary, as the thicker wire, in order to keep the same amount of turns, will need more space to wind on a form. 


The 4.5 inch length was a guess on my part. Basically, at 32 gauge had highest performance at 4 inches of winding, in my experimenting. Perhaps since your wire is thicker, a longer form at 4.5.

oh thank you so much ! i was actually planning on upgrading every component's specifications by 4 ( 3V x 4 = 12V ) i dont know it might work !,0.4738,31
"okay so i believe i have everything i need to make this except the capacitors, i saw in earlier comments you said the one the swatter comes with should work but i don""t know if mine will (https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/CMPP-capacitor_114566714.html) <<<< that the cap in the unit at the moment.

I guess my question is, is there any way of creating a suitable cap bank from what i have laying around? If so what should i be looking for? (ie. ceramic vs electrolytic, voltage ratings, capacitance, etc...) 

Also my secondary diameter is a little bigger then yours (working off stuff i have laying around), mines 1 1/4 inches in diameter, will this make a difference? 

Annnnnnd finally, would it be better to run this off of a couple batteries OR should i just run it off my converted ATX power supply at 3.3V? 

Thanks in advance for the help!",0.9498,174

"that's pretty awesome and judging by the size, i would assume that coil resonates in MHz range though i could be wrong :-P do have a question though .. are those polyprop. caps pulse rated ? i have tried using some in the past as i have a lot but they do explode regardless of the HV rating, they dont stand up well to pulsed AC or DC .. but maybe they work well in a small circuit application .. oh may i suggest bleeder resistors for the tank cap ? 500k to 1M would be good plus the voltage would be spread evenly on the caps. i realize you know what your doing but a newbie might poke around the circuit and get a nip .. cheers from Germany :-D",0.9449,135
