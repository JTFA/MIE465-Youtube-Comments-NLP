I literally cannot use a phone without dash charging anymore. I don't even have any consistent charging habits.

I'm still a Mac user, but let's be fucking honest.. we always have our phones on us, so I don't care about getting a text on my Mac. I had to think it was helpful, but now that I don't have that handoff ability, I don't miss it. My phone sits right next to me and I look at my message.
