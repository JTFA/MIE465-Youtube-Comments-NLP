"James Robson Hello. There is  reason her voice is not the same anymore, her tone changed her upper belting register dissappeared. The reason is from medical perspective vocal nodules.Those are tiny balls on your vocal chords which put a lot of stress on your vocals. She had them since she was a baby. Due to this she has 5 octave registser cause she is singing threw them.However due to havy use of her voice and having 14+albums Her voice changed incredibly. There is a soulution and its to take them out. But she is afraid to do it cause she can loose her whole voice or her whistle(super high note) register. Either she will take them out and risk her career or her voice will keep detoriating.. Not to mentiom her awful sleep and use of alchole...But she can still sing she just need to sing in her register where she feels ok. Have a nice day Sir :)",-0.296,176
