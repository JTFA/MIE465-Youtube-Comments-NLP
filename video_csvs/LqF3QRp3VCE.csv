"Casey Williams I can surely understand how anyone can make a mistake like that. I myself had Scarlett Fever, the disease which gives the delusion that Scarlett Johansson is the most perfect woman on the planet. Of course reality has shown me different. What helps is doing research and looking for flaws in her character. Like, for example, has she had surgery on her body. Or does she perform sex acts which don't agree with you. Or does she sing horribly on an album. Does she say one thing only to do another. Does she care about men, or does She want nothing to do with them. If she doesn't adhere to your values, then why bother with her.",0.8856,134
