"Hey Kathleen! I just wanted to tell you that you are a huge inspiration for me! I love your channel, and you're so amazing. I also wanted to tell you that I feel bad for not being able to keep up with your recent videos. There's so many that I haven't seen lately, which is very unusual since I've been subscribed to your channel for so long now. You were one of the first youtubers that I actually wanted to subscribe to, and that I thought was interesting. I think I've been watching your videos for 3-4 years now, that's kinda why I feel so bad, but I am going to have a marathon very soon where I will watch everything I haven't seen!
Have a great weekend, you deserve it!!

"Kathleen you are so pretty and you are a good makeup artist but you are missing something big... your hairstyle. Do something with your hair. I know you can do it. Your makeup doesn't appeal as much as it would with a nice hairstyle. Also, try different makeup styles like indian, arabic, labnese, egytion, gothic, different culture bridal makeups. You have the potential I know.",0.8252,78
