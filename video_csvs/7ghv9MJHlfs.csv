***Although Chloe is gorgeous she should not have won based on the best voice. This show is starting to suck and become political. The contestant who looks most appealing in front of the camera wins the campaign. Also the judges are not very impartial trying to persuade people to vote for their students without regard to the other contestants importance. This is not fair. The best singer with the best voice should win but it is very rare for it to work out that way. It is obvious also that Blake is well liked by the public so you can say that Blakes pupil won cause they like his eyes (double pun intended).**,0.9256,127

"tkegal Yeah,  that was the same thing I was thinking, man Billy got old.  I was crushing on Billy Idol back in the day when I was a young girl. 
I think it would've been amazing if she sung with Joan Jett or better yet ""Kiss Me Deadly"" with Lita Ford or ""Edge of Seventeen"", ""Gold Dust Woman"", or ""Gypsy"" with Stevie Nicks.
Noticed that almost every wardrobe choice is reminiscent of the fashion from the late 70s to late 80s. It looks like that's the look she's being molded to. Its gonna be real interesting to see where music will go. I hope this is a start of a rock revival. Tired of the cookie cutter, everybody sounding like everybody else. I think Noah and Chloe are going to be a major force in the music industry.
Watching her perform feels like I'm watching MTV again.",0.9545,170
