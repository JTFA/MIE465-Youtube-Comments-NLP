"I love this so much but the 360p on my 4k monitor is killing me. It amazing you were live streaming while driving at even that resolution. I may not be able to hang, though. It's so tiny and distorted and pixelated even at about an eighth of the screen (see note at end). I've seen the This Is Me, the behind the screens, and the April and Davie footage. Someone told me that Klai's voice was post-processed to get so great and here is proof that it wasn't. She and many others in this family are GREAT singers. Everyone in the family is a good singer but there are at least three great ones and the rest are little and will grow into their voices. Why are there so many great LDS family singing groups? Something in the water?

360p is 360 lines of 480 pixels. My 4k screen is 2160 lines of 3840 pixels. 360p is 1/48th of the area of 4k. If you blow up video 48x all the pixels are GIANT. Ten 360p screens fit side by side on my screen with a little extra space left over. My screen, a 27"" is 23 1/2 inches wide. That means that a 360p screen at native resolution is 2.2 inches wide. That's tiny on a desktop monitor about 3 ft from my face. So I don't watch it that small. (My web browser won't even let me scale that small! It only lets me narrow it until the screen is 4"" wide.) So when I watch it, the pixels you shot are enlarged and the vanishingly small pixels at double or triple of 4x or 8x look really large and pixelated and my brain hurts. Sorry. Love you guys. But my screen cannot physically present 360p in any pleasant way. It is hardly usable at all.",0.9932,347
