Another thing I've been wanting to build is a diffusion gradient to scatter target acoustic wave ranges in my recording studio. I think you would love tweaking and researching the application. There's free software called qrdude which calculates blade/block heights to construct 2d and 3d panels. These can be glued, fastened, or modeled based on how complex you want to make the thing.

My jointer spindle is rusty enough to give good contrast against the reflective tape, I think there would be enough contrast between the white plastic of the fan and the tape, might have to hold the tacho off axis (as the reflective tape scatters the photobeam in all directions) don't need to access the shaft, just any part that rotates at teh same speed as what you want to measure.

What is the margin of error on those calculations though? I guess it is much smaller if you get them all right, but anyone's guess if you get something wrong. The relationship between number of poles, supply frequency and speed would be helpful to know for this kind of thing (for induction motor at least, not so much for commutator motors) it's definitely a good way to look at and think about what is going on, recently I measured cut time by editing the video of the thing being cut from first spark to bit falling off which is similar in that it just uses commonly available equipment and free software. This meant the resolution was only 1/12th of a second or so but that was plenty.

"Wheel bearings can make ""moaning"" sounds. They often come on at certain rpms.  Not sure from experience if I've ever noticed a connection to differing load conditions (at / around those rpms).

Also, I did hear another ""moaning"" sound, and this one did happen only under certain loads - was also from a wheel, but it was that the big nut that holds the front hub on to the axle had come a bit loose. Possible that our mechanic didn't torque the new ny-nut (following a job) to the higher torque  VW Jetta specs.",-0.0516,110
