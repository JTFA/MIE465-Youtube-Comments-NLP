"AND NOW FOR MY RANT...

I ordered a Casey Neistat t-shirt on December 3rd. I just received it on Christmas Eve, honestly, I had given up on this order. This t-shirt that I received is not what I ordered. The listing on the website said 100% cotton, and what I received was a 50% POLY 25% COTTON 25% RAYON flimsy t-shirt. I bought it because it was supposed to be 100% COTTON, I can't wear this garment.

I don't think that Casey personally reads or replies to these comments, but I still had to rant.",-0.2732,112

"Dear, Casey Neistat
You need to get advice on merch from IISuperwomanII. Urgently!
I bought her a merch and was extremely happy with it. The price was extremely affordable, the quality is fantastic the delivery was quick and the size served flawlessly. And there were no complications of any kind.
But when I bought yours, I paid maybe 5 times (maybe) more in comparison including the one raised in customs because it got stuck. And when I finally have it, the Small size I ordered looks like an XL. So now I paid a total of 94 euros (115us) for something I can not even use.
Also, keep in mind the viewers buy your stuff because they want to support you. This kind of problem is not good for anyone.

"Hi Casey, I was hoping you would have merch made from your hand written and drawn stuff, not something that anyone of us could make doing a simple Google search for printed T-Shirts and Hoodies.

You may think your hand writing sucks and looks terrible but it's your signature, I'd rather buy something that says Work Harder in your handwriting rather than a font anyone can do. I'd rather buy a shirt that says Casey Neistat in your hand writing rather than a CN font and asterix.

Anyone who is a fan of yours will recognise your hand writing on a shirt and know it's from you. 

Anyway not trying to stump the fire but I was hoping it'd be something from you rather than something I could make myself and sell on Amazon.

Please consider making more merch with your writing on it.",0.961,153
