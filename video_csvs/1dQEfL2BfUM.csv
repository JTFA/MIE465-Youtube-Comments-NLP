"Julika7 it's all about the limitations set to them by the respective publishing industries in each country, like currently  American comics from Marcel/DC are published in larger letter sized pages (able to fit larger panels and speech bubbles) with multiple artists and writers contributing to the lore of one character while Japanese manga is published weekly or bi-monthly from a single author with an ongoing narrative. Japanese manga may seem more compelling because it's structured in a way where each chapter should be a satisfying read (since you read it once a week) while contributing to the overarching story of a single title. They also like making cliffhangers in each chapter to leave an impact on readers and ensure the longevity of their manga using Shounen Jump reader voting rules. Titles in American Marvel/DC comics on the other hand are interwoven with each other so they have to make sure they create stories while taking in consideration the current canon (which is why they like to reboot universes every so often to make sure new readers aren't overwhelmed)

"This is interesting, a good introduction for people who haven't done lit on graphic novels and comic books before. I think Art's book about 9/11 is amazing for analysis as well. One thing to add, is that time is spacial, so the size and shape of the panels creates a sense of movement through time ie. if you have a set of small panels next to each other, they take place as moments next to each other, whereas a long rectangle signifies a longer period of time or a moment. Again, this is basics, and there's so much more to it that I'd encourage people to learn about.",0.9423,120

"This was a great video, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but there's one part of page layout that you left out that could have informed your viewers even further.

Notice the layout of the page on a horizontal basis. In the same way that beats in a film work, there are beats to comics. The weakest point in the beat, or the set up, is on the left hand side, while the strongest is on the right. Each of the word bubbles or visuals can be seen as a way of building up to where the eyes will linger for longest time, the left hand side of the page before moving down. You should be able to cut the page right down the middle and the right hand side should be able to give you the full story. And it does here.

If you take the first line of panels, you can see Spiegel's father is effectively chatting about anything, before Spiegel cuts the chase with the leftmost moment in the line being him saying ""I still want to draw the book about you.""

The next line works the same, everything on the right is familial context for the right most moment, ""About your life in Poland, and the War.""

This is used to greatest effect on the third row however. Spiegel's father talks about how long the story is. Then rather than talking about that, the right hand side of the page is devoid of text and just shows old hands and a tattoo from long, long ago. Reading the whole page, it makes the reader pause for a minute. Taking it for just the beats and it becomes far more powerful.

Finally, Spiegel's father begins to give the context for his own history before changing into the flashback.

When it all comes together, it turns into saying he'll write on his father, then more specifically on him and the war, a pause to let the weight sink in, before finally beginning the story in earnest.

Sorry for the long post, but this was a cool thing I wished you'd told people in the video.

TL;DR the right hand side of the page has all the important beats because that's how we read, left to right.",0.9908,423
