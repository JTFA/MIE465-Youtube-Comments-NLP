Granted this has a 5k display, but you could always go oled which is better than retina and still spend within the amount of the base model.

"You can see that the iMac Pro really is not aimed at pros, as it was firstly provided to the youtube biggest teleshopping stars - Jonathan and Marcus. Marcus is showing really not that complicated editing of less than a 10minute video and Jonathan is showing us everything but the iMac. It does not matter that the Marcus's video was shot and edited in 8K, because in the optimized conditions of FCP X the short video will never run hot or max the system. So it can be cool and silent. I bet the they both signed NDA, that they can not test it with other editing softwares. Premiere would max the system, because it is not optimized. The only apple computer, that does not have troubles with thermals was the old Mac Pro ""cheese grader"". 
And why did Apple not provide you with 18cores? Both Jonathan and Marcus had no chance of maxing 128GB of RAM with their kind of production. How does the machine behave under real load. In other editing softwares like Premiere or Avid. How does it handle background processes in those programs on 10cores? How does the 10Gbit lan port works in SAN or Avid ISIS/NEXIS environments? What about thermals under full load of full day transcoding, exporting or rendering? How does it handle multiple programs at once. I bet that it does really well as old 8-or more core Mac Pros, but it lacks multiple internal HDDs.
So it is really interesting computer, but the design is really limiting. Maybe it is really aimed at youtubers and short-form content providers, but a solid workstation from HP - like Z4 or Z6 is better for the job. Still waiting for the standard Mac Pro.",0.9903,323
