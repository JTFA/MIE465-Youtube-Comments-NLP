"I know that this isn't the main focus of the video, but can I just say that she was actually right about being able to do the jigsaw and listen to the audio book at the same time. When you do 2 auditory or 2 visual tasks at the same you can't concentrate on both tasks as you're using the same part of your long term memory for both tasks, but if you do a visual and an auditory task at the same time you can concentrate on both tasks as you're using different parts of the long term memory. This is called the dual-task performance effect and has already been psychologically proven, so unfortunately her and Nick probably aren't going to be getting a Nobel Prize.",0.071,133
