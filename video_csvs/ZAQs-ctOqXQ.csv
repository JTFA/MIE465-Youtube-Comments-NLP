"I think Pacific Rim was a great movie.  Not for originality, or uniqueness, or for any one quality.  It was simply honest, and good at what it wanted to do, and that was put some giant robots on screen, and have the punch giant monsters.  Michael Bay's Transformers movies, as a completely valid comparison, almost tried to stay away from the robots, out of a fear of being naff (embrace the naff!), and instead focused on the humans.  It was like a soap opera with some robots punching eachother way off in the background.  In Transformers, we don't get to like any of the robots, we don't care when anything happens to them.  Who even noticed or cared when the black robot died in the first one?  Jazz, I think it was.  His whole character was summed up in four seconds of half-hearted break dancing, and then he gets torn in half, ALMOST off screen!

Pacific Rim, on the other hand, gave us some one-dimensional humans with simple motives, and then got them out of the way, for the most part.  We got characters with clear motivations, and clear stakes in the action, and they were all piloting giant robots with the sole goal of punching giant aliens.  The plot moved on, there were no soap opera moments.  Every interaction between the humans was framed around the greater fight.

Pacific Rim revamped a lot of concepts from the anime it was so clearly influenced by.  It did nothing new or original that audiences had never seen before, but everything it did, it did _well_, and THAT is what made it a great movie.",0.9449,315

It's like sending in your main battle tanks before artillery or airstrike bombardment. You will lose more tanks than usual and it would cost more to replace.
