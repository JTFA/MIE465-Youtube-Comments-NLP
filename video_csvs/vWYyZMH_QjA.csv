"Totally, totally...I'm totally sold! 

Shantell Martin, I'm a dancer from Silistra, Bulgaria and I use hip-hop dancing to connect with kids and through dancing to inspire them not to be afraid to make mistakes in the process of finding them selves and I'm not even trying to make them stay in my dance hall, I mean I don't try to push them to like hip-hop or me but to start liking them selves and if hip-hop dancing is their thing, then to stay and dance with me, if not - to follow their flame. But the MAIN goal is to feel good about them selves and be them sleves. 

So your stickers ""WHO ARE YOU"", ""YOU ARE YOU"" perfectly matches my purpose as a dancer. 

Would you be so kind and let me make stickers like yours but in bulgarian with the same meaning? I will share stickers for free to all kids I meet. In bulgarian it will be ""–ö–û–ô –°–ò –¢–ò"" or ""–¢–ò –°–ò –¢–ò"". I thing this is really the point - to touch kids' (and bigger kids) minds so they can be the best version of them selves the way they are.

Funny thing is that yesterday one of the kids told me she was told from a ""friend"" that she will be the last from all kids on their IT exam because she was bad at drawing in Paint. The girls was very upset, it ruin her day because she is so supportive of her friends and also she was practicing a lot lately to become better at drawing in Paint so she can pass the test and I'm concerned that because of that ""friend"" of hers she will stop being so supportive, will stop being who she really is, because her words were ""I am always supporting my friends, why did she do that?!"".
So we stopped dancing and started talking when I tried to explain the reason behind every peace of her story and tried to help her realize that she should continue being humble and supportive but just to have in mind that some kids can be mean (but actually they are not truly mean but just express their lack of love from their parents).

Stickers like yours will help the cause!

What do you thing about that? :)))))))",0.9969,436
