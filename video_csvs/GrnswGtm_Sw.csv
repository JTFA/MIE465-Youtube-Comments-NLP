"Dear friends Jesus Christ is ALWAYS WITH YOU! Upon accepting this truth, these 3 words will become like a safety net for you, protecting you from falling into despair. Because we are human, we will always have ups and downs in our life experiences. But the promise of the Presence of our Lord and Savior limits how far down we can go. Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down. Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. 

Dear ones, not only is Jesus with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory. All you have to do is say YES to Him this very moment and receive the promises of his unfathomable love. ❤️❤️❤️ (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9897,236

It's as if it's all for money.
Yes folks do even die trying to be the best in the world but for what??? Meaning borders are not real but exist so who are (we) competing against exactly?
Don't get me wrong I like the sport as much as the next guy but the bread and circus act is old and a complete destraction no different from American football or WWE.....Ie Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding soap opera nonsense.
Do you honestly think the reason the Olympics exist is to determine who is the best at something????
Then explain why not everybody in the world doesn't have the same opportunity to be in that situation due to lack of funds?
Only those with money have that opportunity.

Rio was so behind schedule that the committee had to ask London if they can be the back up, the water events were held in a polluted bay, Sochi became the most expensive Olympics in history because of corrupt business contracts, and #sochiproblems was a trend because of pillow shortages, missing floors, gov't surveillance in the showers, and stray dogs.

"Worst Olympics Closing Ceremony Ever?

Did the amazing country that gave us a resoundingly successful Olympics and that has given us some of the most deeply soulful art and music also give us an utterly soul-less, lifeless, talent-less Olympics closing ceremony? Did they actually hire a hundred gayageum players and ask them to play the same two notes over and over for five minutes, and then bring on a performer described as an icon of rapping, singing, and dancing, but who for some reason did none of the above, choosing instead to simply repeat ""Where my bad girls at"" several thousand times, and then offer us a singer who lip-synced a vocal performance so auto-tuned it sounded like a singing robot slowly and agonizingly forced through a meat grinder, and then conclude with a boy band that seemed to have been manufactured by producers and choreographers who discovered pop music in the 1990s and have dedicated themselves since then to churning out watered down copies of watered down copies of watered down copies of whatever it was they heard twenty years ago that impressed them, but that most of us have tried hard since the 90s to forgive ourselves for and forget? A notable exception to all the above was actual artist and vocalist Jang Sa Ik.

Perhaps a more important question than whether this was the worst Olympics closing ceremony ever, might be: ""Is Korea losing its soul?"" Has the focus on being the world's leader in technology and plastic surgery turned the home of han and its heart-breakingly beautiful art into a country of mind-numbingly vacuous though technologically impressive light shows adorning surgically altered ""pretty"" faces? This question comes from someone who loves Korea more than anyone on Earth, and was truly saddened to see its great history and talent so grossly misrepresented by tone deaf decision makers who hear music not with their ears but with cheaply-sequined eyes, and who feel not with their hearts but with tastes determined by product placement studies of twelve-year-olds? 

Maybe I should just chill and be happy to see that America isn't the only country that has recently fallen victim to the idolization of talent-less icons. But I won't give up on my beloved second home. I love you Korea! I know you could have done better. I am confident that, after the deserving celebration is over, you will do some soul searching and give consideration to these questions, and you will show the world the deep beauty that you are really made of.

I'm going to say again, you dont have to *like* it but you can't just disregard it and not call it music. *It is music.* I'm gonna give you a definition, okay?
Music is literally ""the tones or sounds employed, occurring in a single line (melody), or multiple lines (harmony), and sounded or to he sounded by one or more voices or instruments, or both.""
That is the technical definition of music. And last time I checked, K-pop has a melody and a harmony and uses voices and instruments. So wake up, buddy, it's music. It's not that difficult to understand.",0.9079,159
