Being that the pound sign which is what it was called since the 1960's has only been called a hashtag since the mid 2000's I would say essentially people that use hashtag me too are saying Pound Me too... Word to the wise  just because you change the meaning of something it doesn't change the real meaning of it. Not to mention when everyone uses it to be ""trendy"" it loses all it's meaning and merit. Crimes committed against anyone should be between a Judge , Lawyers , and the actual parties involved in said crime on individual basis and has no place legally on social media of any kind. Not to mention in this country we have a little thing called due process... Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law , When you use a hashtag you have just sentenced and convicted someone and ruined someones life just because you think it's ""trendy"" to use a hashtag for such even thought nothing of the such has happened to you. This whole minimally exceptional hashtag movement needs to die and use it for it's original intent. And further more I am getting tired of the gay community shoving their preferences in our faces. Just be gay and keep it to yourself because it involves nobody but you and your partner, Just to let you know normal people don't care. We don't go around telling you we are straight all the time do we ? On a side note all these celebrities who reaped the royalties , power , popularity and recognition didn't have a problem with what they were buying when they were in their status but now since most of them aren't ""cool"" anymore all of the sudden want to cry me too for some sort of spotlight is ridiculous... You knew what was happening and you let it happen for the sake of what you wanted. You could have easily spoke up way back when and still had your royalties , power , popularity and recognition. Now you just look like fools. and what about statute of limitations ... Remember those ? meaning (A statute of limitation is a law which forbids prosecutors from charging someone with a crime that was committed more than a specified number of years ago. The general purpose of statutes of limitation is to make sure convictions occur only upon evidence (physical or eyewitness) that has not deteriorated with time.) ...

I think Rose has carried this fight as far as she can. She should pass the banner to others now. If not I think she jeopardizes her health and well-being. I think she's holding back in what she really wants to say. I just heard her say that more than 1 in 5 women are raped and is certain it's much more. She also said we all know a pedophile.

"TransientClassic  Agreed - she *is* brave, particularly in light of all the trauma she's experienced in the past / negative feedback she's getting from the public at present. My biggest criticism of Rose is her  false claim that she ""accidentally"" worked with Victor Salva, a convicted pedophile who made a comeback once out of prison. Unless she was in a coma throughout the *entire* filming of that movie, it's absolutely impossible for her to not have been aware of his background - *everyone* in Hollywood knew about it. She even referred to him as ""a very sweet man"" after making the film. A ""very sweet man"" who did serious time for grooming and sexually assaulting a child/adolescent over a period of 5 years ? Right-o.
Admitting the truth - that she *did* know all along - would destroy her reputation and perceived integrity within the context of this movement. Consequently, there's no way that admission will ever happen. There's simply no act on earth more profoundly depraved than the rape of a child. Having grown up in The Children of God - an insane cult notorious for glorifying and actively participating in adult/child sexual relationships - she should understand this better than most and openly acknowledge / vilify it. She's certainly got the ideal platform to do so at the moment.",-0.3693,253

I'm proud of her, I support her 100%",0.9437,72
