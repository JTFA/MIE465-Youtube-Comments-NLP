"Rockstar confirmed a while back (a couple of years after release) that the UFOs and Zombie Guy were gonna lead to an Invasion DLC and Zombie DLC that were gonna change the map entirely, and a third one that they wouldn’t say anything about. Everything ended up being used for online because a bunch of staff were fired/left to make a new company. The main guy fired was the “father of gta” and many staff left with him, leaving the game to go to shit because the higher ups wanted money over better content. There’s a thread somewhere on Reddit with all the rockstar word on the alien/zombie dlc we should have got several years ago and how GTA single player died before they could remake what was lost. Hopefully RDR2 gets them instead",-0.8176,153

"Shesez, I may still have you subscribed. But I am still angry and butthurt over what you did to me.

What did you do to me? You stole an hour of my life on my day off by claiming to do a Livestream where you were going to explore the glitch levels of SMB3. You didn't do that. You just acted out dumb skits, taking compliments about your homemade glasses, and made huge, useless deals whenever someone gave you a ""donation.""

In fact, the only time you seemed to give a fuck about what you were supposed to be doing, was when you said ""Whoa! I found a ""functional"" level!"" but you didn't really care so much to notice that ""functional"" level was really just World 7-7.

I know, I know. At the beginning of the Livestream, you said the stream was not going to be ""informationy"" but that does not mean we were going to instead expect a bunch of stupid skits and absolutely zero comment on the glitch levels. You said NOTHING, SQUAT about them. There were SOOOO many dummied out sprites I saw in that footage, but you were too busy with your stupid skits to notice.

I still wait for the day you rectify all this.",-0.9612,245
