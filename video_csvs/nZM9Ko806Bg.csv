"I did this while bored in the writing studio back in college (I was a student writing consultant - helped fellow students with their papers), except I laid my face on the scanner, and slowly rolled from one ear, over my face, to the other, trying to line up the  part flat on the glass with the scan line. I don't know where those pics are. That was the early 90s. I did this center-slice idea, too, but I held my camera (I think it was an Canon Elph, pre cell phone days!) against the window and filmed a long stretch of Sepulveda blvd's cars and mountains. It's neat; if you slice the center line, you get a long pano. If you slice to the left or right, you get this pano that's like a view of the side of everything, e.g. taken from the right side, you see the all of one side of signs and bridges. Taken from the other. you see the other sides,  yet it all still looks right. I'd kind of like to do that again on a straight road at a more consistent speed (all the curves and traffic meant lots of stretching and squishing of things horizontally), and then make an animated version of every vertical line, like all of the first columns, all of the second columns, and maybe something that sine waves through them. Or maybe you can do it, and I can just click like :) I didn't know Python back then (was there even Python back then?), so I wrote a Photoshop action that loaded all the frames dumped out from some shareware utility, cropped them, and saved them.
