"For those who read this comment, Jesus Christ Loves you and knows what you're going through.
Life is hard, and He personally knows all about it. 

He died and rose again for you to live for eternity. Believe in Him, and His Love for you.

If you were to fully know what He has saved you from, you'd be living every day for Him. He is coming VERY soon, sooner than you think. 

Call on Him and be saved! Repent of your sins, turn to The Lord, for He is our salvation! He will forgive you of all sin if you sincerely seek and trust Him. 

In that day, when we are finally with Him, there will be no more tears or death, just peace and happiness.

"I will start by the very real miracles that occurred in my life.

I was a homosexual, I was REALLY active in the LGBT (a four letter acronym at the time)
I knew I was gay at 5 years, it seems.

The attraction was a very real thing to me, I must stress, since every time I share this testimony, I always get the skeptics, but it doesn't matter to me whether they believe it or not, because I know who I was and my Redeemer. 

I literally did every thing I wanted. In fact, I was also a very spoiled kid growing up.
When i became a teenager, I obviously became more promiscuous, but also very depressed.
It resulted from my anger towards my family. I ""escaped"" by watching porn and a LOT of other disgraceful things, (I was also a ""Furry"") 

I just wanted to die, all t he time, but one day, I REALLY wanted to die. I was almost convincing myself to jump in front of a moving car. At that moment, it was like The Lord Himself shouted at me. Fear struck my heart so badly that day, I felt like I was going insane the days after this occurrence. 

I was in desperate need of help, so I called out to Jesus. He literally heard my cries for help.
At that time, I became active in the Catholicism traditions, because I thought The Lord could be found in religion. I was very wrong.

As I continued a few years in the Catholic faith, I finally found The Lord leading me to read the Bible.
It was tough, since I also had developed a debilitating OCD. OCD leaves a horrible feeling in the mind, almost like an itch you can't scratch, unless you do exhaustive habits repetitively.
When I read through the Scriptures on how our Lord was punished for my own sin, a lot of intrusive thoughts entered my mind. They were insulting my Lord, along with the evil men and women, gnashing at my Lord in that Day my Savior went to the cross. I started crying. It was so tough, because the more I tried to stop myself, I couldn't. The thoughts just flowed. I realized I NEEDED my Savior. I was so wretched.

The more I studied the Bible, the more my OCD left me. Along with my depression and porn addiction.
I then noticed Catholics do A LOT of things that opposes what The Lord truly wants from us - a HEARTfelt relationship, and not traditions. So I left Catholicism, and been serving The Lord by keeping what HIS WORD says, and not a man or woman says.

I never sought to abandon my life as a gay man.
The more I followed Jesus, the more desires of having a man left. I became attracted to women.
I shared this story with the gay community, and of course they did not believe me. Unfortunately they probably think I betrayed them in a sense, but this is TRULY not the case. If you experience something in your life, something that was deemed IMPOSSIBLE by the world's standards, how could you not be happy in sharing an ""impossible"" event that has occurred in your own life? NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD! Some also believe I am a liar, but if this is true, that I am lying about my testimony, then what does that say about my faith? Am I lying to myself? WHY? Why would I lie to myself, and believe it? That just doesn't make sense to me.

But I would never want to change this walk for anything, because Jesus used it to bring me Home to Him. Hallelujah! 
I also have a soft spot for the gay community, because I know HOW real homosexuality is, but I also know HOW REAL The Lord's Power is! AMEN!

I have been changed, because Jesus Christ is Lord. He is MY GOD! And in that day, ALL knees will bow and all tongues will confess that Jesus is Lord - including yours as well, friend. Unless you're a robot, and not a real organic human life form. :)

Only, by then, if you have not received Jesus before you die, it will be too late.
Jesus is the ONLY WAY to escape, because He took our punishment for us on the Cross.
Thank You, Jesus!
Hallelujah!",-0.9795,851

It is a petition for (the god – Amen) to fulfill our words. ”
