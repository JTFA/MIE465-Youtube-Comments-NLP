"Dear friends be highly encouraged to make peace with God the Father through Jesus Christ THIS VERY MOMENT. Pray and tell Jesus you are sorry for your sins against God. Ask Him to save you from your sins. Put Jesus Christ first in everything you think, say and do. As soon as possible be water baptized and ask and trust Jesus to fill you with the Holy Spirit. Allow the Holy Spirit to help you read and absorb the New Testament Bible. Obey the commands God has recorded for followers of Jesus Christ to obey. Join other Christian believers to help answer your questions, to pray with and encourage and strengthen one another. You will be rewarded greatly and your life will be forever changed! God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. John 3:16 ❤️❤️❤️",0.9936,159

You've seen the worst and you've seen it in me

I know that there's times
That you get so tired
And you know I want you to stay

But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me

Baby, I've been thinking
That you've been hurt and it's because of me
Oh woah, oh woah
Baby, my ship is sinking
So don't go over, don't try to save me

I know that there's times
That you get so tired
And you know I want you to stay

But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me

Oh woah, oh woah
Oh woah, oh woah

Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me

"[Verse 1]
Lately I've been thinking
You've seen the worst and you've seen it in me
I gave you every reason
Every reason to get up and leave

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that there's times
That you get so tired
And you know I want you to stay

[Chorus]
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me

[Verse 2]
Baby, I've been thinking
That you've been hurt and it's because of me
Oh woah, oh woah
Baby, my ship is sinking
So don't go over, don't try to save me
 

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that there's times
That you get so tired
And you know I want you to stay

[Chorus]
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
If you got to leave
Do what you need
But don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me

[Bridge]
Oh woah, oh woah
Oh woah, oh woah
Oh woah, oh woah (don't stay for me)
Oh woah, oh woah (don't stay for me)
Oh woah, oh woah

[Outro]
Don't stay for me (don't you stay)
Don't stay for me
If you got to leave (if you got to leave)
Do what you need (do what you need)
Don't stay for me (don't stay, yeah)
Don't stay for me (don't you stay)
Don't stay for me
Don't stay for me (don't you stay)
