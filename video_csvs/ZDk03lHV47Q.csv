"So awesome !!
Now whenever I see this kind of project I always ask myself ""What is supporting the weight?"" In this case it's the screws at the top and the brass member at the bottom. 

I know what I'm about to say is ridiculous, but I'll say it anyway.... chalk it up to OCD.
Obviously the shelf is strong enough to do the job, but why would you put the brass member in the middle of the shelf instead of at the bottom? In effect you are supporting the top half of the shelf and the bottom half is dangling off to bottom. The bottom half of the shelf is actually working against you instead of for you.

Sure, this is negligible in this situation. But from an engineering point of view it just seems wrong.
I know... I know... a ridiculous criticism. I already admitted that. It's not really a criticism. 
I'm just  wondering if there is a reason for this decision.",0.3161,185
