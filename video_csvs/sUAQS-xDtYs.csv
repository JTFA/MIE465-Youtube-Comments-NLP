"That is not a bass, nor R U attempting 2 use it like 1.  Instead, U never even play the low strings, & the high ones sound like pathetic toy trash like a little plastic box. If U R going 2 do an 'extra strings' so-called 'bass' solo, use the BASS strings sometime, clown.  Like U could do this same 'demo song' but played very low, and we can laugh how the thing isn't even designed 2 B played because U can't even wrap your thumb around it 2 reach? HAHA  U could B there all contorted trying 2 play it without a thumb behind your neck hand LOL That JOKE non-instrument is a FAIL TRAIN!",0.9689,133

You need to find a 36 string bass. I hate that stupid Pratt bass because it's really an 8 string triple course bass guitar. A 12 string triple course bass would have 36 strings. The 15 string bass could play way more notes and has a higher range if all the strings functioned on it. Both of those need to be done correctly.,-0.6908,68
