Funny shit. With telling people since the 1980s this is our future. Ahh. To be told you are crazy and see the world finally come into sync with the way you have seen it all along lol. Now that is what fucks with your sanity. Makes you wonder did the world catch up to you. Or did you head further into crazy land lol. But with the evidence at hand. It says we are no different than we used to be. Just grown up a lot. And see we were never crazy. The world just couldn't see the world the way we did because they can't see anything but what they are told to see. That this world works off of people letting others tell them what to do and how to feel. So break free from that existence. Become the best you can. I will admit I try and not let me ego get the best of me but seeing every single tech that I pictured would come out from the 80s to now feels pretty good lol. My teachers that thought I was nuts now think they are nuts and question everything seeing everything I said would happen happen lmao. The only 2 that have yet to happen are full planet VR. And the transferal of our minds to a digital system creating a new universe in one that our minds live on forever. And become seprate from us. Making us immortal. Or they could choose to upload their mind and end their body. To save it from the stuggle. But it becomes a new existance in one that fantasy and reality no longer have a boundary. They are the same thing. And no one will ever want to come out if we transfer those experiances back to our body. Scary shit. To see perfection and come back to a world so ugly. Who knows. Maybe this is not the first time we have followed this cycle. =P Enjoy the mind fuck btw. lol. I see shit past this even. But. It seems more like fantasy than reality because it just loops over and over in different ways that lead to a multiverse each time I process it. We are already building a multiverse we call the collective mind. The emergent property of the many individuals linking together to become more than the sole person can ever be. And as our knowledge grows so does our multiverse. AKA Perspective. We all live in the same world with our bodies. But our minds all exist in a different world. Some small changes. Some large. Some so big it doesn't make sense. And some. The lucky few. Exist in all perspectives. Take my advice when you go for the key. Enjoy the good and the bad. And never give up!. Make your story a great one!. Reach for the stars and become a legend!.,0.9937,539
