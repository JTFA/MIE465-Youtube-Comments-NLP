"What has this earth turn to.

People flexing on people who can't even afford a piece of Bread. 

But here we are saying im humble.

There are people in the world who don't need to SAY they are humble.

They show it 
With there actions
And how they treat OTHERS.

We WERE once humble......

But the was in the past.

So can you say he is humble

When those $1000 could have gone to people he actually need it....

$1000 could defintly buy clothes and food for the poor.

Or $1000 could have gone to a child who can't go to school

YEAH im humble he said.

Im humble -scot

I only wear it once -scot

This girl at the club steped on my shoe let me get another one.

What does humble mean?

 Humble: having or showing a modest or low estimate of one's own importance.

Does scot show that.

My guys will get it.

Don't say your HUMBLE when you really aren't.

I have a dream of when people will understand the meaning of humble.

Where people see there are people sufering in this World.

Thats my dream. 

I hope people are dreaming the same dream.

Lets make it happen humanity.
