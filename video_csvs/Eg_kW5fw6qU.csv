"I am always super skeptical when it comes to new streaming services. Netflix's greatest calling cards are affordability and ease of accessibility. When Doctor Who disappeared from Netflix the BBC's streaming service wasn't made available in America. The Daily Show disappeared from Hulu but Comedy Central's website is such a pain to navigate and loads too slowly. As a consumer I notice when content goes missing, and have always been supremely disappointed in not being able to access content where it ends up. Unless Disneys streaming service is remotely as user-friendly as Netflix, I'll be sticking to one subscription and find new favorites on Netflix, a reliable service that works.",0.5927,119

I know I am a little late but as a movie theater mgr. in the 90's and early '00s the real reason Disney re-released The Lion King has to do with the split .... For the first 2 weeks a movie comes out the it is a 80/20 box office split (average depending on contracts) with the studio getting the 80% plus a roughly $5k a week rental fee ... but the longer a movie lasts the better the split is for the theater .... Disney always had a habit of pulling a movie early only to re-release it a few months later which not only boosted the box office take in general but it also reset the split,0.2926,127

Basically if he so tripped even a tiny bit he would bleed instantly like like he was made of glass he was soo fragile. I think why Disney refused this movie idea at the time was due to the fact it was to dark of a subject. Also Rasputin the real one was a holy man who was a good man since he was affiliated with the royal family mainly the care for of the prince for spiritual healing .  he was shot as well but somewhere else .Don moved on to make his own films. His films were so beautiful and dark abit and fun at the same time many were classics.",0.9806,194

Also, seeing that the real Anastasia died with her family by being shot through and thrown in a cold ditch, the movie is kind of moot anyways.

It's official now. Disney sees princesses not only from past works they adapt as fair game... but they also eye princess's from other people's imaginations/movies/universes too. They get well known-enough and infamous, they want them. They are princess collectors. If they didn't create it, and they can't get them due to copyrights, they'll simply buy them out.
