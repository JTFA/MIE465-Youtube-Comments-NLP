"I have never heard ofnthis family, but their movement seems interesting.  Although I do not know the incident that they're speaking about with trump.......their father knows good and well how certain types of folk roll.  I wouldn't trust anyone saying anything from a diatance as well.......being that more than likely they're just toying with his mind.  When someone really wants to tell you something, they'll make it their business to.  Saying random words that seem like or come across as though isn't the way a concerned or sincere adult behaves.......most folk think if yournskin have color you a fool.  To them you lack the skill (mindset) and cognitive thinking that allows you to see right through them without getting emotional or responding irrationally.  Personally I think folk that play these type of mind games have folk (they consider close) around them that communicate by way of mind games or passive aggressive behavior.  Some things should not be accepted, and if said person refuses to respect ****you.......distance is so key",0.8862,194
