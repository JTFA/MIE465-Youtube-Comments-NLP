Cities and suburbs (like Ferguson) would still be nice places to raise a family. Crime rates would be very low. Interracial rape would be non-existent. People could once again leave their houses unlocked, trusting their neighbors and community. There would no longer be any no-go zones in inner cities. Cops would be respected and they would respect the members of the community. There would be no Michael Brown situations. There would be no rioting, no looting, no wide-scale arson and destruction of property. White flight would be non-existent. White families could feel confident in sending their children to their local public school. I could go on and on.

"SAG-AFTRA has modifications to this ""rule""  to help mostly background/day player(?). So it's dependent oh where the production office of the shoot is located. Deadwood for example had it's production office on set so people expecting ""mileage"" for driving all the way out  to Santa Clarita were often bummed they weren't entitled to mileage. Don't know how other unions handle mileage compensation but then, like the Director's Guild their primary focus is to keep their members working, hence they usually come to terms faster than SAG-AFTRA, or are less likely to go on strike like the Writer's Guild.

"Since 2008 (the last year I paid to see a movie in a theater), I feel ashamed for ALL the entertainment in my life I have consumed, including classical music.  As MUCH as I LOVE classical music, it is a strong addiction, especially Beethoven & Tchaikovsky, my 2 favorite composers, hence I go out of my way to AVOID listening to music.  I limit my entertainment consumption to The Simpsons & Family Guy, both of which I've seen every single episode since the start, and SNL. They are just as good as ever, which is EXACTLY why I wish they would stop. 

There really is NO NEED for Hollywood.   True - it provides joy, unlike prison systems and private health insurers, or the NSA DEA FBI CIA, which either torture by imprisonment or invade our privacy, churches that spread lies & myths and bankers who steal our wealth.
Nevertheless, if I had the power, I would annihilate Hollywood and all arts & entertainment and all government agencies that only punish individuals, and Wall Street and churches, and force everybody to work ONLY on NECESSARY jobs:
