And no, it was not a defect unit... LG just shipped the phone quickly and cut corners. Even for its Snapdragon 821 it was not performing as fast as it could do. 
I returned it and went back to my iPhone 6 Plus which SURPRISINGLY takes MUCH BETTER PHOTOS considering it's 3 years older than the G6.

"Jonathan,  great video of the lenses.  I just ordered my P2 XL and got 2...maybe 3 quick questions.
1 - when using the lenses are you shooting using the camera's auto settings or are you shooting somewhat manual?
2 - how do you feel the case will hold up with a metal plate for magnetic car cradle/holding purposes?
3 - I shoot with an older 5D mkii but would like to trade off the bulk for the portable.  What's your overall opinion of the P2 XL in regards to video and stills?  Do you think it has the ability to be a daily shooter and give professional results?
4 - OK i lied...i have another one.   Any other accessories you feel are great for the P2 XL?

"question.  on the telephoto shot of the sneakers....you took the shot with the pixel2 and compare with the telephoto add on lens.  I would like to see the comparison between the add on lens telephoto (sneakers shot) vs. the pixel 2 ""zoomed in"" so that composition size wise of the shoes subject are the same.  Because, with the zoom you could likely get a similar aspect ratio with the subject at the same size as the shot with the add on telephoto.
   What I would like to know is.......if you adjust the pixel 2 to zoom a bit to give the same composition as the telephoto add on lens.  THEN how do they compare. Does the pixel 2 lose something in the shot (visible pixelation) that the add on telephoto lens does not.  OR, as a slightly zoomed shot (let's say 20%) on the pixel 2......does it hold in quality similar to the add on telephoto.  Or, what is the degradation in quality that of a 20% zoomed pixel vs. the telephoto.  Also, on the wide screen lens (granted this is needed because pixel 2 only goes so wide) BUT.....to me that wide screen shot with the add on lens didn't quite look right.  It looked like it had a little bend to it.  The wide shot with the bending palm trees and sky from below looked great but the long shot of the building with the add on telephoto (the first one you showed) had a little bit of a bean effect to it where the image seemed a bit distorted with regards to the horizontal landscape lines.  Not as noticeable in the palm tree shots due to lack of horizontal (wide) lines.",-0.4019,328
