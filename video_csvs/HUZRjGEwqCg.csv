Trump is a different President to be sure, and this Presidency is taking a much different approach to domestic and international policies. The times we are in are differing dramatically by the year, and we should expect to see different people, leadership and events- they may not all be pleasant or good for us, but they will happen (not a reference to any person/event).  All that can be truly done by individuals in the States is the personal and strong  practice of the Christian  Faith.

All Democratic should be ashamed for there scum ways. There disrespect for America and Americans was so obvious. They embarrassed America to the whole world for their stupidity. The Democratic Party needs to be voted out they don’t care about the Americans they care about illegals.  No rights for Americans just illegals. Americans go to jail illegals go free.  Americans pay for their crimes illegals go free and Americans pay for the illegals crimes. Illegals pay no taxes Americans pays for their welfare.  The Democratic Party has to go.,0.3041,100
"Also! President Obama loosened the rules to allow the 14 states that have legalized marijuana to some extent to regulate themselves without federal interference. http://huff.to/eQfa7j(Compare that with the Lord Donny regime, which has already announced plans to “crack down” on these states and banish the “evil weed” from all of society. As if we don’t have more important things to worry about.)

President Obama expanded national service offerings and increasing funding for groups, including tripling the size of Americorps. http://bit.ly/idgQH5

After years of neglect by the Bushies and Republicans in general, President Obama and Democrats provided $4.3 billion in additional assistance to 9/11 first responders. http://bit.ly/o7cWYS

To help those communities devastated by Hurricane Sandy, President Obama issued an executive order setting up the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, and asked Congress to approve $60 billion in supplemental assistance to aid in storm recovery. http://1.usa.gov/134L7hl (Note: It took Republicans in Congress a month to approve $9.7 billion in Sandy aid, with 67 Republicans voting against even that. You can find the list of 67 here: http://bit.ly/2sf0aWd Pay close attention to how many of these Representatives come from states who have asked for assistance many times in the past.)

President Obama expanded trade agreements like NAFTA to include stricter labor and environmental agreements. http://bit.ly/etznpY

President Obama and Democrats oversaw increased funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. http://bit.ly/dFb8qF(Now, Lord Donny and the GOP are promising to kill funding for the NEA. Not because it saves you money, but because it provides for a slightly larger tax cut for themselves.)

President Obama and the Democrats’ decision to invest in General Motors returned the company to its place as the premiere car company in the world. http://lat.ms/zIJuQx

In fact, GM was in such good shape after what Obama and Democrats did that, in 2016, they returned a share of their profits to employees, doling out checks for as much as $11,000. That is in addition to buying back the stock the government purchased in the bailout. http://detne.ws/1mk7Jry

President Obama doubled the funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which does research on how to improve manufacturing efficiency. http://bit.ly/eYD4nf

President Obama guided the massive TARP program in a way that recovered more than was actually spent, by forcing banks to pay back more of the money. http://bit.ly/2alXjlV

President Obama also established the Making Home Affordable home refinancing plan, later branded Home Affordable Refinancing Program (HARP), which is still going strong. http://1.usa.gov/goy6zl

Democrats passed and President Obama signed the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, which helped millions of Americans avoid preventable foreclosures and provided $2.2 billion to combat homelessness and to stabilize the housing market. http://bit.ly/2aiFCbi

President Obama was able to created an institute, called “Promise Zones,” which will invest in more manufacturing jobs in the technology fields of the future. http://nyti.ms/1egyXrV

President Obama created an atmosphere that encouraged China’s largest manufacturer, Foxconn, to build a large plant in Pennsylvania    http://cnnmon.ie/1k7LT4S

President Obama worked with Apple Computer to get them to build more product here. As a result, the company is building two large plants to manufacture products in the U.S.; one in Texas http://zd.net/1nkpt2O and one in Arizona.  http://bit.ly/1mXY5Vg

President Obama ordered all federal contractors to pay a minimum wage of $10.10 per hour for work done on all federal contracts. http://wapo.st/1iaU5kd Since this decision, many large employers, including Disney and Walmart, have increased their minimum wage for workers in stores and other facilities.  http://bit.ly/2c3iwF5

President Obama showed leadership in getting the G-20 to commit to a $1.1 trillion deal to combat the global financial crisis. http://nyti.ms/gHlgp5

President Obama ordered the completion of the International Trade Data System, a digital trade record book, by 2016. This move will streamline and simplify the process through which small- and medium-sized businesses set up the export of US goods. http://bit.ly/1nwSRF4   http://bit.ly/2rfQPk2

Signed bill to expand opportunities and to promote greater Native American tourism.    http://bit.ly/2dTIQmo

Though he had to shame Republicans in Congress into going along, he got a $305 billion highways bill passed. This bill has the added benefit of created hundreds of thousands of new jobs and creating incentives for green cars. http://bit.ly/1NsL2Zq

In 2010 alone, more jobs were created under President Obama than were created during all eight years of the Bush Administration. http://bit.ly/hrrnjY",0.9976,1250

"Dillon Ouellette you are a moron
1) Obama had the lowest gdp growth of any president since 1900. Not a single year of +3% growth
2) Obama increased food stamps, and poverty
3) people stopped working labour participation rate fell
4) according to Harvard 97% of the jobs he created were part time
5) housing sales were pathetic under Obama 

2017 vs 2016 you fucking moron

2017: rising interest rates, +2.5% growth (higher than all 8 years of Obama), 200k manufacturing jobs, highest consumer confidence ever recorded, deregulation opposing obama's policies, all time record one year stock market gain. Fall in food stamps to a decade low.

2016: 0% interest rates like all 8 years under Obama. +1.4% gdp growth. Obama's economic advisors openly said 2017 was back to recession. Obama had quarter's in his second term where GDP growth was negative. -70k manufacturing jobs. Spike in food stamps. Spike in unemployment benefits. Stagnant stock market since 2014. Low confidence. No optimism. Obama was convincing america that +1% is the best we should accept

Obama like bush was a historic failure as president. 

His policies of regulation, govt spending, and being anti-business ruined this country. 

It's important to look at facts before you cry on trump. 

Coat-tails my ass. If you never realized we were stagnant under Obama, and that all of his legislation (stimulus, Dodd Frank, Obamacare, etc) did nothing to help the country you are a fucking moron. 

Also Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration is helping blacks so much in terms of economic growth & jobs. 80% of African Americans want merit based immigration for this reason.

Obama failed you fucking moron. 
Economic policy, healthcare, immigration, and foreign policy... Disasters 

All he managed to do is take race relations back to the 1960's with his open race baiting. Gave the Democratic party identity politics.

He won in 2012 because he was black... Not by merit basis. 

Bush won in 2004 because of the Iraq war. 

Republicans stopped war mongering... Will democrats end identity politics? 

Will democrats stop viewing elections as personality contests?",-0.5883,412
