Just coming over from watching you via Netflix since last year.  I watched Andy Kaufman, and all the classic SNL stuff, a lot when I was younger and it hit me today how much you had to have been inspired by him.  Tweeted as much ( twitter.com/KWightArmstrong/status/938300082411237376 ), before coming over to find that, duh, this is apparently no secret, since you talk about it here (and probably other videos I've yet to watch)...anyway, stayed up way too late watching your videos tonight- too much fun!  Glad to find all of this to watch now that Haters is over, though!  : )",0.7835,127

"This is a thought: your phone rang because one of the room's next to yours could hear you talking through the walls probably and decided to call you to get you to shut up.  I've had that happen to me before.  Passive aggressive people, geez.  

I loved this vlog.  I know you don't think it's a big deal to show us ""before the show"" stuff, but just think that a this is not the world of some of your viewers like me, and so seeing your prep and some of your show (I live in Missouri, honey, you are never coming here :p ) is so fascinating to me.
