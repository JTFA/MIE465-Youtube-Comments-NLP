"The problem with hydrophobic fabric treatments is that they wear off after a while. Unless the textile itself has hydrophobic properties the bag will not remain ""spill proof"" for a very long period of time.

Finally, it's not clear if the zipper has a water proof seal, or what happens if a liquid spills inside your bag.",-0.3451,91
