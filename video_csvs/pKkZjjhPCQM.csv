Ned wasn't planning on attacking him which means, no danger, no Spidey-sense. Please do your research more before trashing on good movies",0.0567,118
"I loved this movie, just saw so I'm catching up on honest trailers and this, but can I add a few sins?

2:50 look at MJ up on the right upper corner, where the hell did she get that book, why has no one said anything about it? 
3:26 Why cart all that shit around for one guy? isn't it better to travel light?
3:43 bullshit water catch only works in video games
4:35 radiation and lotion sets this plot device rock off, but not a goddamn hammer's impact!?
7:26 re-dact sin: that's what gives it the impact it has, they set this up earlier in the movie's pre-amble scene, with him talking about how he has to provide for his family, then when shocker #1 threatens to tell his wife, so when he finally shows up, it allows you to look at things from his point of view now and see who he has to protect (Since most of us probably forgot he had a family). That randomness took everyone by surprise precisely because of how 1 in a million it was 
7:51 the movie's biggest problem: No one hiding a secret knows how to keep/hide a damn secret!
from 9:33 to the coney island bit, Why the hell did they show him throwing away the helmet to the iron man armor? Considering how much shit tony puts in every piece of the armor, that alone is worth millions. For a guy who just gave a speech about how no one cares for the little guy, this douchebag doesn't try to help stop the plane or something!

"Of all the Spider-Man stuff they added to his list of abilities via Stark tech, the only one I really had a problem with was Karen, and it's not because it goes against what Spider-Man's about or whatever, I think the whole idea of Karen is cool. I just want a Spider-Man movie where he talks to himself! The OG Spider-Man and the Amazing Spider-Man both didn't do it, and this one doesn't do it in favor of the portable AI helper. Let's have Peter just talk to himself for the audience! It tells us what he's thinking and planning at all times. It's kind of a cheap storytelling trick, but it's so quintessential for his character it sucks we don't get to see it onscreen. Holland's performance especially would go good if he just started talking to himself. The 90's animated series NAILED the concept of Spider-Man talking to himself.

So what would calling him achieve? Little bit inconsistent there.

Vulture doesn't just use his tech to rob banks because he doesn't see himself as a criminal. He sees himself as an honest, hard-working person whose activities are labelled as crimes by people like Tony, who he sees as the real criminals. Also, robbing banks would attract too much attention; they ""stay under the radar,"" and only go for the Avengers stash out of desperation.
