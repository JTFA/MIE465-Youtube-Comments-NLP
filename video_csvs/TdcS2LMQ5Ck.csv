"""Too many ballads tonight""? Really?? Ballads that were very profound and had beautiful messages behind them. But ofc that doesn't matter to him because he's too busy trying to emulate michael jackson and music from the 90s. He didn't deserve this award, nor did he deserve album of the year, considering that all of the songs on the album were garbage and had absolutely no lyrical depth. Leave it to the scammys to completely disregard true artistry.",0.8168,88

"All I can say is,

It's a shame Latinos never get recognized equally. Unlike Black and White artists.

Despacito was heard around the world! It broke records that no song has ever broke before. It literally made history. 
But people are blind to that fact solely because it's a Spanish song, and it's deemed as ""dumb"" and ""poor"". 
People just don't realize how much it would have meant for us Latinos if Luis Fonsi won song/record of the year. 
To have a little taste of our musical sounds heard around the world and win a Grammy would have been amazing.. But no.

Edit: before people come at me and start saying ""Bruno Mars is technically Latino"". Look, Bruno doesn't identify as Latino. & besides, I'm talking about a REAL latin artist.",-0.7644,156

"For Grammy.. the Record of the Year is 24K Magic by Bruno Mars.  I dont have anything against Bruno Mars i like him too because no doubt he's a versatile singer. & i like those old school dance on his music videos.Congrats anyway..  But for me, DESPACITO is the Record of the Year. Its the most popular song of 2017 .. worldwide.. A lot of singers in every country not only in Asia but also in Europe made their own version of Despacito. A lot of non-spanish language people are singing & dancing to this song eventhough they dont understand the meaning because its a catchy song.  Its 3.8 B views here in youtube & no one ever do that.. only Despacito. (Just saying..)",-0.154,138

"Its time that the grammys select winners with talent, good music with a meaning, not garbage like ""despacito,"" or songs that just talk about money, sex, drugs,etc. Seriously, they need to nominate the music that is real music, and the good lyrics not just whatever lyrics. Just because an artist have various songs that have so much popularity in the media and things like that does not mean anything. They are very few artist with TALENT in this generation, its time that the academy select the real artist that produce the good real music like they did before because now is just full of garbage.",0.938,121
