streetlight cultists is using the old tactic of being a hater of Ghostbusters 2016 but they don't acknowledge the reasons why that film was bad.
Ghostbusters 2016 failed because it was a blatant feminist propaganda film envisioned by feminists Amy Pascal and Paul Feig.
And most intelligent people know feminism is a hate movement masquerading as a equality movement.

See the problem with Ghostbusters (2017) was that the cast was trash and the movie was not funny. It had nothing to do with the female leads. This movie may very well be good because it has a talented cast of women, a solid plot and it’s a spin off of a really great movie series. Not a remake like ghostbusters. A spin off.

Warner Bros. sold Rotten Tomatoes, but Warner Bros. still holds a minority stake with the company.

Instead of making a 
original film starring a female lead like Million Dollar Baby or Wonder Woman, Warner Bros. rehashed Ocean's Eleven and replaced the blokes with women.
Ocean's 8 is such blatant feminist pandering cash grab rubbish.

I don't get why they have to take movies that are already established like Ocean (insert number here) or Ghostbusters and then replace the cast with all women.
Why not be original and just come up with you own title, you can have it all be women, fuck do a play on Cat Burglars add another chick and call it 9 Thieves or some shit alluding to nine lives of cats.
Stop trying to shove your agenda on movies that don't need to be remade, quit using their names to buoy your movie, if it can't survive on it's own merit then you shouldn't make the movie.

>There are far less films centred around, written by or directed by women than those that feature all men casts, or films who's few women characters are there only to cater to the male ego, be sex objects, or damsels in distress

i'm fine with that if hollywood drops its misandrist double standards. when they start replacing female casts in female franchises and completely re-write them to cater to men specifically  then i'll agree it's a fair deal. until then they can fuck themselves. you fems/cucks must think we don't notice hollywood's misandrist trend (the best recent example being that  feminist garbage Last Jedi). that's why ghostbusters flopped.

Regardless of whether you believe that hollywood has a misandry problem (which it doesn't, it has a misogyny problem), movies with mostly women in don't make them immediately bad movies.
