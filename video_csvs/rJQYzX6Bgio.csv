So sorry you are sick. The flu shot isnt helpful because influenza continually changes from host to next host. It is better to let it run its course keeping up the liquids. With all that you already have going on with your system I am shocked that anyone in the medical field would recommend you getting a flu shot. It puts excessive stress on your already stressed immune system. Love you enough to recommend avoiding the flu shot from now on. X💖X💖,-0.8236,91
