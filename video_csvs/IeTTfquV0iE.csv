"""I Say So""

I woke up this morning with some things laid on my heart
Couldn't go another minute being in the dark
Will there ever be tomorrow? We will never know
But we're in this world together
And together we should grow, row, row
Oh woah oh, oh woah, oh woah

There's one thing I know for sure

Every little thing gon' be alright
Every little thing gon' be alright
'Cause I say so
Every little thing gon' be alright
Every little thing gon' be alright
'Cause I say so

There's no need to worry 'cause we're gonna be just fine
Grab my hand and join me, darling, let's forget the time
'Cause I see children laughing even though their days are gray
All of us are dreamers and we have something to say, yeah, yeah
Hey yeah hey, hey hey, hey yeah hey hey hey

There's one thing I know for sure

Every little thing gon' be alright
Every little thing gon' be alright
'Cause I say so
Every little thing gon' be alright
Every little thing gon' be alright
'Cause I say so

We, we are
Gonna be, be alright, right, right
We, we are
Gonna be, be alright, right, right

We are the children of the world
We are the lovers of the earth
And that's why every little thing, every little thing gonna be alright
We are the children of the world
We are the lovers of the earth
That's why every little thing, every little thing gonna be alright

Every little thing gon' be alright
Every little thing gon' be alright
'Cause I say so
Every little thing gon' be alright
Every little thing gon' be alright
'Cause I say so

We, we are (we)
Gonna be, be alright, right, right (gonna be alright)
We, we are
Gonna be, be alright, right, right",0.994,364
