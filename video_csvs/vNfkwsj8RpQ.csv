"Agreed!! Two weeks ago, a family a few blocks from our house, their house burnt down. They had no insurance and they lost two of their cats and most of everything. Surprisingly, they were able to recover their VHS tapes (had old home video footage of their kids, etc) and also memory books that were stored and tucked away. Fire didn't touch them. Then watching This Is Us, got me thinking even more! I think it is time to invest in a Fireproof safe and also some fire extinguishers in our closets and other parts of the house to be safe.",0.2593,116

"I thought there had been hints that the fire and Jack's death were related to Jack's drinking.  I'm so very happy and relieved to know they weren't.  Just another household tragic accident.  Not the Crock Pot's fault; not the wash cloth's fault.  A faulty switch, no batteries in the smoke alarms; and just like regular people, we often forget or ignore the seemingly simple things.  Any appliance plugged into an electrical outlet could go bad and start a terrible chain of events.  But I'll bet most of us don't unplug our coffee makers, digital clocks, ovens, refrigerators, televisions, VCRs, DVD players, computers, monitors, cordless telephones, microwave ovens, clothes washers and dryers every evening when we go to bed or leave the house.  ONE appliance in the Pearson home had a fault that was known.  It was turned off (faulty switch) but not unplugged.  Obviously they've done the same thing time and time again with no  issues.   It only takes once to become a tragedy.  There really isn't any blame to be placed; except maybe the ""real people"" (the characters of the show) for using a Crock Pot with a faulty switch for how many years, for not changing the batteries in the smoke detectors.  But you know, ""This Is Us"" portrays a family as people, regular human beings, who are fallible -- just as we all are.  I wish Jack would have let the dog die and the photo album and video burn; but that is not who Jack is.",-0.9765,294

It's not like every flashback has to be some huge moment in Jack's life, because there's just all these little memories that the family has with him, and that's what we've gotten a lot of so far.
