Carmax does look at auction results to give you the estimated amount of money they're willing to pay for your car, but it has a cap so they cannot spend more than a certain amount of money regardless of the vehicles true value. They'll still buy it from you, but they're supposed to let you know that going elsewhere to sell your exotic will yield more money.",0.8647,83
