"*LYRICS*

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage, who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my momma that's the realest shit

Girl, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch in the way that you bringing me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day, for the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We are running out of time

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer",0.9101,517

I hope, especially after this movie, that we can start acknowledging  different cultures and skin colors (for those who were stripped away from theirs) and respect them... Is just such a beautifull and crazy thought... I love you all. Stay strong, because it gets better. Look at the hard work of your ancestors and how their hard work paid off for their children and grandchildren and the generations after that and imagine if they gave up.  They didnt. Just hold on. Stay strong.",0.9889,150

"Ok call me crazy but I have a theory on Kendrick's pirate look. I was so confused as to why he was dressed like a pirate in two of the scenes in the video so I googled the word pirate and this is the definition it gave me ""Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates. "" So after reading this, I deduced that the colonials were the original pirates when they arrived on the African coastal areas and took precious cargo (people)  in order to exploit them abroad for self-gain. In the starting scene, Kendrick arrives in a boat guided by the ancestors who were thrown overboard. I think this is symbolizing him being a pirate and stealing back the ship his ancestors were taken on and returning it back to the motherland ie: the end scene where he is dressed as a pirate standing in front of the 4 tall women. Am I reaching or am I on to something?",-0.9244,212

"The message is so deep .....I am so emotional hearing these lyrics.......you seee our ancestors are haunted by the horrible ways we treat our brothers and sisters
the history like Columbus being awesome  is based on lies, oppression landtheft and being a sociopath more accurate and I am ashamed of my whiteness but I am grateful to be kind and openminded & alive and ready to help our planet abolish racism .....to my logical mind its some very tiny minds.... that are scared to death and feel inferior that created such foolishness like racism .....diversity is our strength we as a people ready to repair and heal and acknowledge real love is humanity.....misogyny and hatred or fear still so small compared to 
KINDNESS AND DETERMINATION........ ALL THE STARS ARE  CLOSER  we are all made of star dust and we are all beautiful the human race is 
not inherently flawed we can overcome this terrible war on love thats brought by oppression and greed our future ...our planet needs us to work on it
I was fortunate  to survive certain death ...being young  12 and abandoned in the streets on the SF bay.. predators are of many hues but always human",-0.6033,213
