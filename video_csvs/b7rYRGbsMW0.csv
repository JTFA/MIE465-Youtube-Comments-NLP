But, yeah, there are obviously going to be some unexplained UFOs pop up, since no-one can explain everything.

As for taking it seriously: The problem is when people start making assertions that there isn't enough evidence for. For instance, the Department of Defence (DoD) apparently denies that the video came from them, and no-one has provided full documentation that the video did come from the DoD.

But for him to say that it's jumping to too many conclusions to say that it's aliens or not of this world is asinine. You do not have to have a degree in physics or astrophysics or quantum physics to make intelligent logical assumptions any more than you need a Physics degree to know that if you throw a ball up in the air it will come back down any more than you need to understand the physics and Mathematics of gravity to know that that is also true that when you throw anything up in the air even if it's not a ball it will come back to the ground.

"Okay, the problem is the vast majority of people involved with this and UFO sightings generally are nonsense. They cant think critically and think everything is a conspiracy. Here is a truly thorough logical argument as to why a small percentage of sightings are very legitimate and need to be highly researched. 
To establish a high level of credibility for a possible Alien Spacecraft, a sighting would need to have two things: 1. It would need to be a proven PHYSICAL object. (not a glare or light)
And 2. Move in a much more advanced technological fashion than any modern human technology.
--Judging by what the Pentagon Officer and Fighter Pilot described, we will hopefully CLEARLY have established these two important aspects, that it
1. Was a physical object (again not a glare) and
2. Traveled in an very apparent technological fashion far more sophisticated than any human technology.
We need more just a little more video evidence to document this as extremely credible. We need to see more  technological movement. (Hopefully we will get the radar evidence as well)
This DOES NOT prove that it was an Alien Spacecraft. However it is reasonable to state it as a possible explanation. Again as long as a little more evidence comes out it will be put with the JAL 1628 Incident of 1986.",0.803,250

Or do you think we should believe that aliens visited us because of fuzzy pictures and video that could have been altered or been taken with faulty equipment?

Look at it this way: No-one knew what caused gravity until we advanced enough to know that all masses create a gravitational pull (probably due to the way they fold space?). But, before that, people probably thought that God (of gods) continuously used some power to keep things from floating up into the air (or I've also read the people might have believed that angels pushed the planets around in our solar system). We don't believe that angels are pushing around planets and other objects affected by gravity, so why believe that every unexplained object must be aliens?",0.4329,190

"Soulsphere001 As Stanton Friedman said: 97% is explainable and can be debunked. But that means the remaining  3% is what we should be interested in. Besides Roswell there are so many very compelling UFO cases, unfortunately not many people take time to really get into it. I name a few, Rendlesham Forest case, the Malmstrom nuclear airforce base in '67 UFO case etc.
The people that want evidence must realise that there actually is evidence. But also that it was confiscated. Even a single movie with an interview from a TV station disappeared from its can. (Westall case)
Humans are wired very strangely. When we spot a Russian airplane, we come into action. Investigations are started and witnesses are taken seriously. But when an unidentified object is seen, and backed by radar, the report just fades away.
O' Hare airport for instance, had been shut down for hours due to an unidentified object hovering and seen by hundreds of people at the terminal and by a united airlines crew. It was reported but then all investigation was obstructed. Something definitely is going on. We can laugh about it, but when sooner or later there is a disclosure, some may be very shocked. If we take the matter seriously we are better prepared in case they do exist.",0.8908,250

The idea that a large number of people believe that aliens have visited Earth doesn't mean that's true. The video showed a blurry object moving in an unusual way, and the pilots didn't have anything else to present other than eye witness testimony, which is the lowest form of scientific evidence.  I'm not saying aliens aren't real, I firmly believe they are. I just believe we've never been visited because  there's no solid evidence.
