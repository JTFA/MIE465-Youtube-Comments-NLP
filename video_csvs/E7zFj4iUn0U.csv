"""It's important to learn from your mistakes, which I did! (as he looks directly into the camera) *stutters* and I'm going to continue to do."" - Logan Paul
 If Logan had truly learnt something from this whole experience he should have said ""It's important to learn from your mistakes, which I *am*.""
He hasn't learnt shit. He is just sorry he damaged his brand and made people mad and doesn't understand why what he did was wrong. He's already put this behind him and now is just playing the part to appease everyone.
Logan Paul is a self-obsessed sociopath with a superiority complex and it won't be long till he'll be back to his old ways.

One hey is fine, thanks. I was never complaining about him. I was criticizing him. Or do you think Logan should be immune from critique?

"Logans mistakes in Japan:
+1 Thinking a suicide forest would be a fun place to film a vlog
+1 Illegally going off trail in a suicide forest
+1 Bringing a camera off trail in a suicide forest
+1 Actively searching for a corpse in a suicide forest (lets face it, thats what he was doing)
+1 Finding a corpse and filming it
+1 Acting like a jackass about it
+1 Making it about yourself
+1 Editing the video
+1 Uploading it for the world to witness this poor mans final moments, and let those he loved watch him hang
+1 Putting the body in the thumbnail to attract views
+2 For each bullshit apology
+9001 For each time he was a jackass in Japan

Other mistakes:
+1 Pretending to be murdered in front of kids
+1 Starting pretty much a riot at vidcon
+1 Using a kid as a puppet to boost his ego and help sell merch
+15,000,000+ all the kids he has brainwashed into supporting him and making him rich
+1,000,000,000 for all the times he has been a jackass

Let me know if i missed anything

Lets add a few for how insincere he has been in the face of what he did in the forest. If he really did change, he would have realised that he is a POS, and would reevaluate his life. But clearly hasnt, he is just playing victim, and trying to dodge a singular bullet. He didnt come across that body by accident, he was actively searching for it. You dont go off trail in a suicide forest with a camera, and are not looking for a corpse. It was all for attention, and he was too stupid to realize it would infuriate people.

Guys, nobody should kill themselves. That should be stupidly clear by now. The reason why i have such an issue with Logan Paul is because of the impact he has on our kids, and on society. What he does is put on a fake personality, picks up a camera, acts like a mixture of a giant douche and an unhinged toddler, then acts like hes above everyone else, and pretends his life is better. Then he will go ahead and say 'be like me, you can have fun and be cool like me if you BUY MY SHIT'. He is a brainwashing scam, and he is toxic to the mental health of children.

He isnt the only one online who does this, theres shitloads of them. But one less is progress. Lets save self esteem, self realization, and true self expression for another generation, ans teach our kids that they dont need to seek someone elses approval. Lets burn this bitch to the ground.

Any thoughts that he may have actually changed have been eradicated in my mind, he clearly doesnt care about anything. He has no goals, no aspirations, just money. Fuck you Logan Paul.

You dont even have any real talents, nothing even worth looking up to. So what you do is flaunt your wealth around, to make you look inspiring, and it makes kids think youre the shit, all because of assholes like you who believe that money is happiness.

I guess what im saying to everyone, is to look for whats real. Real emotions, real feelings, real expression. Find whats real inside you, and whats real out there, and hug it along with the people you love and dont let go. It may be sadly hard in todays modern commercialised society of bullshit. But if you understand what im saying, then i just want to say thank you for reading this. I hope you achieve the wonders of freedom, love, happiness, and the feeling of such realism to the point that it feels like fantasy. Rather than try and buy it the way it is apparently being sold to us, lets find it ourselves. Thank you.",-0.8785,745
