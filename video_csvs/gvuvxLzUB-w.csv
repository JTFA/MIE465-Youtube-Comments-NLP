That sounds so hard to me. Since everyone would be kicked out at once, they would all be trying to get a job at the same time. So many people work at stores and if you live in a place like I do, hardly any jobs are available already. 

Also, what about the elderly people who don't know how to use technology for shit? My great grandma outright refused to get a touch screen when she was alive because she hated change. Would people like that be denied groceries until they change and figure out what they need to do?

Obviously all places want a system like the one seen in the video so they can save billions of dollars by replacing their workers with machines. I'm assuming every place that can afford this technology will have it in the next 5-10 years.

One day, humans won't need to work. Everything will be relatively free just as long as you don't take too much. Especially if people are getting kicked out of jobs left and right.
