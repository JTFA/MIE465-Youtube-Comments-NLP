You're my inspiration girl, you take me places, put the words right into these songs

Stealin' kisses undercover babe
I see forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took on my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

Stealin' kisses undercover babe
I see forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
