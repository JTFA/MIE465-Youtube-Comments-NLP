"I was just thinking about the Donald Trump hand jokes (there was one in the video incase you missed it). I just find it funny how much Donald Trump does to himself. Like most people don't give a shit what your hand size is; I know I don't. I don't even know who originally pointed out his hand size.

For a guy in show business and who thinks of himself as a genius, Trump really doesn't know how people work. If he'd ignored this ""insult"" it might have stuck around for a couple of weeks and then for the most part forgotten. But since he drew attention to it and bragged about his ""size"" it's something we'll never forget. Any even better thing to do would be to own it, get involved in some sketch that specifically mocks his small hands. If he did that people would have a lot more respect for him and nobody would insult his hand size because he'd taken ownership of it.

The jokes haven't been about his physical hands for a long time. The joke is about just how insecure a man he is.",0.9477,210

"OMF'nG. . . the horrendous bullshit vegans vs meat eaters in the comment section below. I hope EVERYONE realizes that eating meat is murder  AND eating vegetables is ALSO murder. Everyone needs to just get off their high horse. Both plants and animals were alive until we harvested them for our own survival. I'm a vegetarian and I can accept that killing plants is also killing a living entity.... I'm not vegetarian because I'm taking a moral stand. I eat veggies to be healthier and the films I've seen of the meat packing plants has turned my stomach so the thought of eating an animal makes me feel horrible to support such a horrific industry and it makes me feel ... sad to see the suffering of those animals. But that's not a moral position. I'm no more ""moral"" than a meat eater.  I do my best to minimize the amount of suffering of other living entities so that I may exist. That's really all any of us can do. I certainly don't look down on people because of what they eat..... well unless they are eating Hotpockets... that shit is just nasty.",-0.989,208
