 Thank you for the meaning of Tokushima....I was meaning the nuclear power plant named Fukishima, which is a disaster that happened March 11th 2011

""Perhaps you should look it up.""

You don't think I bothered to confirm what I already knew... that you were incorrect? I did look it up to double check... in order to verify... and confirmed that you are, in fact, incorrect.

A metaphor states that one thing is another thing... It equates those two things to construct a comparison through symbolism, not because they are actually the same. The ""eternally"" adjective does not do this... it describes a permanence, it does not create an analogy through replacing the thing being described. And when they spoke of his stained fingernails... that wasn't figurative... it was literally the case... his nails were, in fact, stained blue, so no metaphor was being applied... and describing the staining as being eternal was not phrased as if it was figurative either, as they even made an effort to state a _cause_ for the eternity of the staining... that is not how metaphors are presented. Even if they weren't being literal... it still isn't a metaphor.",-0.4055,203
