"Kathleen, I had to stop the video to write this. I've had Invisalign for 1.5 years now and I know exactly what you mean, but I wanted to stress how important it is to wear your Invisalign religiously in the first few weeks. Even though it drives you crazy and you want to rip it out, don't do it! You have to power through it to get used to it. I promise it'll be better and worth it, after a few months you'll forget you're wearing it, but these first weeks are crucial to get you into the habit of wearing it! Wish you the best of luck!",0.9537,119
