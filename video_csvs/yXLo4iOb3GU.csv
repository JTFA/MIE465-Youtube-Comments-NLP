"Aww, I love this video! you really seem to be improving and trying to be honest and stepping out of your comfort zone!
For me, I'm trying to be more genuine with other people and tell them something about myself, what I think about all day and also to initiate more, like getting to know new people but also spending more time with old friends and being more active in those friendships and in general with people speaking up more if I don't agree with what they're saying or trying to also make them see the other sides or simply making a stand if they're saying something offensive and everybody ignores it.
Another thing I'm trying to work on is trying out more things romantic-wise and and not necessarily pushing everything and every feeling away right away!
Another one is to do more creative stuff, privately but also showing and involving other people more and doing more tangible creative things that actually lead to something to prove and improve myself and give myself space to grow and explore
On another note, I want to take more time and motivation for improving my life in a very practical way by cleaning my room, doing my hair, showering, getting my body fitter, journalling and making calls I have to more often",0.9852,233

"Hopefully be able to meet you in person one day. I think we would learn a lot from each other. Your surroundings and resources are your motivation, change can come from being forced upon positively or negatively. What ever the energy, dance with that rush and loose yourself in the new.

Organisation and spontaneity is a sliding scale that needs to be neutral. The opposite ends of that spectrum are monotony and chaos, i hope your year maintains that healthy balance.

These are a few things I had to surmise with the help of friends, therapy and meditation. Writing this is an example of me trying to make more opportunities and push boundaries. Thank you for pushing your insecurities and perfectly blogging to inspire others, i hope to achieve the life you have encompassed on my own merits. You are an awesome soul.

Visit Berlin, the capital of the most popolated European county and also the one with the hugest economy. Berlin is know for beeing very liberal and creative. Vist a concentration camp (Dachau) you will experiance feelings of things, a war that the US as never seen, something that you only experiance in europe. The feeling of death and the greatest wars of all time. Wars were sometimes whole Regions were Killed.  This builds carakter. Visit Amsterdam in the neatherlands, visit munic, Vienna,  Venice, Rome.
