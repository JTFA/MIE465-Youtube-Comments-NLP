"During an ice storm in 2005 my mother's house lost power so she had to move in with friends for several days. She had to leave her indoor tabby cat Bootsy behind so I drove from my apartment to give the cat food and water. Fortunately the house never got below the low 50s but while I was there I sat on Mom's reclining chair for a while. Bootsy jumped up on my lap so I opened my winter coat. She crawled inside and took a twenty minute nap. Early in the following spring Bootsy passed away, having been a comfort to us for nearly 18 years.",0.4588,114

"I want a kitty. right now. why I never find an animal in need ? The only one I was able to help by catching it was a small bird who would have died in the wild. I guess it was a budgie. I went to a shopping mall after my night shift.  He was in the middle of some crows and tried to get some food,  but of course they scared him away. So there he  was trying  to fight for food  around a shopping mall on an island but he was too weak to stand up against  the wind there.  When I tried to get near him with a stick of seeds and corn he way seemingly so hungry he landed on my finger, but flew away when the wind hit  him and hided in a bush where he could rest.  I never held a bird before.  He was so small, light weiht and fragile! 
I  had bought corn sticks when I saw him first  and also a towel which I threw above him  when he was too busy picking on the corn stick...it took four hours to get him finally,  but then I got him. Poor guy must have been really  scared and so hungry ! 
 I put him in my bag  very careful because I had nothing else and was afraid if I left to get my transport cage,  he would be gone and die slowly. .... At home I made him a  ""cage"" out of a rat cage in which  I put a stick between the bars for him to sit on, with water and  small corn sticks until the animal rescue team came to take him and to hopefully find his owner. I hope he is with some mates now  and has a loving home.",-0.7779,324
"I was driving out in countryside one cold snowy night. Saw little lights in the road. They were a litter of kittens dropped in the middle of no where.
