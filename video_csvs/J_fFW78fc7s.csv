"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends! 
Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He loves you! He is not angry at you and neither does He hate you.

Jesus died and rose again for us! He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so stop believing the devil's lies. 

Jesus wants you and truly cares for you. 

Jesus has delivered me from my sins, fears and horrible depression. He will do the same for you, if you call upon Him today. He will hear you and save you. 

He will also deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed towards this earth. He already took our punishment upon Himself. 

So friends, I pray you make today the day to call upon Him and make Him Lord of your life. 

Shalom!",0.8116,155
