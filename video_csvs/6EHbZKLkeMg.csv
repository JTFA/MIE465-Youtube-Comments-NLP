African American women on the other hand? Usually never change and are at the bottom of the dating totem pole. Other men of other races? Lmao you think men are like women, you lot who respond to societal shame like fraudulent sheep because you are NOT independent and didn’t build jack shit ol. Gather all the women you know, you won’t be able to build a sky scraper even lmao.

Also those men of other races you talk about never look to black women as a serious option, not even for hook ups; seeing that 50% of you African American women have genital herpes, and have a terrible attitude that their own women do not have. 
Men are attracted to femininity and African American women are the farthest thing from that lmao even Asian men who are right above black women on the sexual market totem pole, somehow manage to have more options even with their women selling out to white men and gold digging lmao while some are into black guys.

There is a reason why African American women Are the highest demographic of single people by percentage. No one wants your shitty undermining attitude; coupled with you stupidity, poor decision making, terrible health practices and obese/ over weight trifling  weave wearing behind.

"It’s funny you speak of African men not being narcissist but forgot the fact I stated I am a dual citizen; sweety none of my ancestors were slaves; came on a plane in business class with my dad and siblings 😂. All you are trying to do is deflect. This is coming from someone with very vast world travels and views who happened to go through the u.s educational system from high school through college ( a step back because at 13 was already learning the same physics as a standard I would only be able to see as a sophomore in university with a STEM pre-med degree). The slavery argument doesn’t work vs me I am an unbiased observer who came here and have gone through this system of direct white supremacy ; and came to the same conclusion that African American women in general sold out and keep trying to be accepted into European society and standards of beauty (the same Europeans/ caucasoids that forcefully raped them, their men and children and continue to use & discriminate against them as less than human concubines). Yet you have silly bedwench coonettes making up delusions of ‘other options’ lmao. Black men are the only men on earth that have ever looked at black women as an equal and the simp mama’s boy ones put a lot of dusty, dumb no good African American women on a pedestal as ‘queens’. There is literally no other race of men that even do any of those things. Men are attracted to femininity; more estrogen levels , less testosterone ( black people have the highest levels of testosterone) so black women, especially the bad attitude, no respect for male authority , raised ones are *NOT* being looked as a serious mating option by most men of other races. For starters women are attracted to men with higher levels of testosterone, black men have that, rhythm, compassion, the bad boy image and attempts by society to demonize black men actually back fire. How do you expect other men who cannot even satisfy their own race of more feminine women in the bedroom, to seek a woman who is less feminine, more argumentative, and in many cases less attractive and more insecure? Makes no sense past financial gain or the guy is not experienced yet with dating most women. I could type all day but the proof is in the pudding, there is a reason why African American women are the least desired women, have the highest single percentage ( and you know a lot of them lied about being in a relationship lolol at restaurants you always see them sitting with other women or alone😂😆 or wishing their delusional self “ happy Father’s Day to me too!” On social media. No man with self respect wants anything to do with you clowns. Stop lying to yourself African parents especially mothers warn their sons about avoiding you trash; so imagine what other mothers of other races say? They introduce not just that but colorist and racism into the mix amongst the bad attitude and low value in productivity to society. The excellence of black men in the face of unfair adversary is well documented even up till today. African American women sold out long ago as a whole ; no one respects sell out trash who cannot even wear their natural hair and have no self shame trying to look European 😂😄🤣😆😬",-0.9884,638

"Point is what options? African American & black women in general are the only demographic of women who their male counterparts have more dating otions than them and rank much higher on the dating/ sexual market place value. This is in many ways due to the ‘inspite  of’  attitude and never conforming nature and will to excel regardless of all forces against them, will of black men and also the terrible self hating , awful, unpleasant attitude of African American women. Black men have media, family and everyone against them yet somehow still manage to outperform most on fair and even unfair dosadvantaged grounds. Westernized black  women cannot even hold onto their own image;  blonde weaves? Malaysian hair? Lololol ashamed of yourself ; black men never try to look white or European , nor do they try to copy their boring hair styles or usual awkward demeanor. You clowns sold out on your own men, trading black power movement for ‘feminism’ to fit in with whites omen ( who actually have somewhat ofa case on their men oppressing them) ; your dumb asses traded the future of African American black people in exchange for section 8, and other government trinkets that are only available when disfunction & ignorance is upheld.
