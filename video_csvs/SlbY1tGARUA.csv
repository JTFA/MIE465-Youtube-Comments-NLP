"A few years back they made a universally loved commercial commemorating the ""Farmer"" and here they tried to commemorate MLK and his message of service. The average farmer loved the recognition of their struggle given light by the former commercial, they didn't cry that that the speech was used to sell trucks. Here, they tried to give light to the notion of service in a speech given by MLK, but that is being viewed as sacrilege. People need to get off their high horses here. Personally I loved the commercial. It was a speech I had not heard until this commercial aired and it was no different than the farmer ad that was praised a few years ago in the way it was presented. Frankly, if you're offended then you need to reevaluate your sensitivity, because the same ad ran praising the farmer and they were emboldened, and there is no reason that those who value progress and service should not be so emboldened. I was inspired by Dr. King because of this ad, and I am sure I'm not the only one. Is that a bad thing?",0.972,207

That's the way the advertisers do it."" even more from the sermon... ""Do you ever see people buy cars that they can't even begin to buy in terms of their income? You've seen people riding around in Cadillacs and Chryslers who don't earn enough to have a good T-Model Ford. But it feeds a repressed ego."" 

What is the point of any commercial? To sell products and make money, right? Exactly what Dr. King spoke against in the very same sermon... You think all liberals are ""stupid"".

Yeah they're trying to sell cars.  But some people would not have heard MLK's words if not for this ad and for them to include it I'm glad they did.  The wider the message the greater the change.,0.7717,41
"You guys should totally get Billy Joel to sing ""Movin Out"" in your next ad while showing people throwing cash at all the Dodge Vipers as he does it. As bad as that'd be, though, it still wouldn't be as stupid as this idea was.",-0.1838,51

"as a black man I look at both sides of the argument. some say ""they shouldn't use his sermon to sell trucks"", and some say ""lighten up, it's just a commercial"". the thing is this commercial brings his speech to a whole lot of people who never heard it. we all know MLK is not going to sell you a truck or even convince you to buy one. With Dodge being the messenger, all I can say is forget the messenger, did you get the message?",-0.34,99

guess i'm in the minority of the people that really like this commercial.  If a short advertisement is going to convince you to make a large purchase like that which is stupid in the first place because cars lose their value as soon as you buy them then you're just weak.,-0.0036,53

"the point of advertisement, is and always will be, to sell more product.  There are myriad ways to disguise this fact, but it is by definition what advertising is.

So sure, they can paint a warm and fuzzy picture about altruism...but at the end of the day, if a car company doesn't think that an ad will result in increased sales, they won't spend the money to air it.",0.7839,80
