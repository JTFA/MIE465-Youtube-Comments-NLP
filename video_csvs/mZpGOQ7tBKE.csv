"Probably not the best test - he didn't ask how you should ask when in a foreign country, which is with manners.

American's (generally) don't/won't/can't say ""excuse me, please can you tell me...?"" Everyday American English is inherently rude, whilst not actually trying to be, compared to other cultures. 

Example - ""Hey, can I GET some of those chips?"" No ""please"", no ""may I"", no ""would you mind"", no ""thank you"" - just the person asking ""getting"" instead of being given or ...shock horror... actually asking politely, as if you (think you) would when approaching a stranger. That's why this test is probably  flawed.

American English has very little by way of manners in terms of how US English uses - or doesn't use - universal English words, of which there's a severe absence in everyday, general use. This is especially noticeable to foreigners who then think (wrongly) that ""Americans are rude.""

Even so, machine translation, which is never perfect, really depends on what you put in being considered/selective.

If you don't put in manners, you won't get it out. As this guy didn't.

Rikards Matvajs Nothing wrong in the google buds,-0.4767,8
"Rikards Matvajs let's be real here. I am an Android guy, but I will admit the airpods are a well executed idea that was very successful. The pixel buds are simply bad; there aren't any redeeming factors in my opinion. The translate function is the only redeeming factors, but that is clunky and not useful in practice.

However, I think the airpods have weak sound. While their bass is quite punchy they don't compare with anything Bose or seinheisser pushed out. I picked up a pair of the Bose soundsport wireless which offer great sound quality. I have a friend who let me try his to compare them with mine, and there isn't any competition. To me it is night and day.

I think airpods are awesome; they are practical, easy to use, idiot/fool proof and an amazing product. Even if you're not a fan of apple as a whole you have to admit that they made something awesome.
