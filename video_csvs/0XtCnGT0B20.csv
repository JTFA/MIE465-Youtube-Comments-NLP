"I am not senegalese but I do love their traditional Sabar music, especially when it is accompanied with the talking drum. The  mbalax, senegalese ""pop"" music mingled with their traditional music isn't bad either.  Youssou ndour mastered that.  When I was watching the premeire, I heard this music in the background. I was so delighted  and surprised to hear music I have been listening to for years in a movie score.  Shout out to you Ludwig Goransson.",0.9647,88
I appreciate y'all for putting pieces like this up genius.,0.6369,11
"I can honestly say that Ludwig is a genius , because I haven’t seen the movie yet but I have listened to the movie score and the craziest thing is that just by looking at the title I am able to IMAGINE what is happening because the music is auditory and visual at the same time. And I absolutely love how Killmonger has the traditional African instruments with the (trap) beats on top because it gives him a true African American score. My favorite is “Burn it all” because as soon as the lady starts singing I can just feel Killmongers pride and imagine his footsteps. Ludwig is a true VISIONARY !!!!! I’m obsessed and haven’t even stepped foot into a movie theater (yet)",0.9855,141

I remember hearing that drum beat with the 808s included when watching for the first time. It really piqued my interest coz it sounded African with the talking drum sounds but also modern because of the 808Bass and this sort of mixed african-modern theme really fit in well with the movie,0.8428,52
I think he was in pineapple express with Seth Rogan,0.0,10

"I've been listening to the score all day, (and I've yet to see the film!). This is definitely one of the stand out scores for the MCU, Mr. Göransson has absolutely crushed it!

"In Black Panther, citizens of Wakanda have the best of everything in the world: technology, fashion, global privacy, hot people. But it took the movie’s release to reveal that they also had access to the best American cultural export ever: the long lost but ever beloved 6-second video app Vine. Like anyone else, references to Vine-born memes are part of young Wakandans’ vocabulary",0.9052,77

"Many people technically know, many others subconsciously realize how important the score of a film is in terms of running parallel with the visuals in telling the story.  Naturally, man ""bit's"" segments things to help him process the simplistic complexities of the world. There aren't many that can truly translate or bit visuals into music.   Normally speaking, dark colors (or night) usually are associated with the villain or bad times. Lighter colors (or day) are linked to the hero/heroine. Music can be created on anything.  That's great, right?!  The supply is there.  However, this makes it harder to isolate the right sound to accurately depict a character, a scene, an emotion. I've seen this film five times.  It wasn't until after the fifth time that I sought out the score and listened intently for the color, texture, changes, to see how it translated the visuals. As I listened (without seeing the images), I could identify each part of the film, each character by their intricate theme, and I was blown away to listen at how Ludwig Göransson blended them all together in wonderful harmony.  I think this score is a masterpiece.  As others have already said, LG, you ARE a genius and Genius is amazing for sharing this video!",0.9715,249

"You can't be serious. Why would investors gamble with their hundreds of millions of dollars to do something completely out of left field that no one is asking for? There may be a few dozen people who think like you but most people don't care. For most people having a classical instrumental is a vital part of the viewing experience, and adds to the emotional resonance of many scenes in the movie.
