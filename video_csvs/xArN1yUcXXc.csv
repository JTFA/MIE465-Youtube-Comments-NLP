"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends!
Repent of your sins and put your faith in The Lord!

He loves you! He is not angry at you, so please don't be afraid to approach Jesus.
He promises to never drive anyone away when they come to Him in faith.

The Lord died so that we may live! Please let this TRUTH comfort you!
This is how MUCH The Lord loves us, friends! On the 3rd day, Jesus rose again, assuring our redemption! Hallelujah!

If you do not know Jesus as YOUR Lord and Savior, please make this moment to call upon Him, you will be saved.
Jesus is the ONLY WAY to escape the oncoming Judgement, since He took our punishment on Himself on the cross. Thank You, Jesus!

So make Jesus your Lord and Savior today, if you haven't already.
You do not need a fancy prayer to save you, just all out to Jesus and ask for help! HE WILL HELP YOU! BELIEVE ME! 
This is what all I did, and Jesus washed me and redeemed me of a life of sin and depression. Thank You, my Lord. Amen.

Shalom, friends!",0.9937,228
