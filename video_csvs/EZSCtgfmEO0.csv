"Have you ever thought about meteorites? Why has never one ever impacted earth in recorded human history? If you research it, there will not be one example of a city being destroyed by a meteorite. Of course we can see the phenomena of ""shooting stars"" but do they ever reach earth? I know of Vesuvius, Italy was destroyed by a volcano. Antigua, Guatemala from earthquakes. Many islands have been destroyed by tsunami. But what city has ever been destroyed by a meteor? None.
I have heard hearsay stories about someone's grandfather's uncle's neighbor once found one in their field. But where was the blast crater? Never.
I have kinda sorta heard about one somewhere hundreds of miles from civilization in Siberia bumf*#! Russia but upon further study, they are all from Methane pockets that are rising to the surface as the Tundra thaws out.
I have heard about ""Meteor Crater Natural Landmark"" in Arizona that supposedly is made by a meteor, however, this NasaNazi-monument sits just 30 miles below Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument and Arizona has a ton of dormant volcanoes and lava flows. Craters formed by volcanoes are everywhere, this humans have witnessed.
Or they will tell us that one hit somewhere in Sudan in the middle of the Sahara desert hundreds of miles from a big city in sand with no blast crater.
Or they will tell us that it was what destroyed the dinosaurs and that the crater is under the water somewhere.
Or they will need to build a special defense satellite system that will protect us from an end-event from a meteor.
What perplexes me the most is... If all the meteorites burn up in our atmosphere? Then how can we send satellites through the same temperatures? Aren't meteors made of harder elements than aluminum, steel, and heat resistant glass? And why don't the satellites get blown to smithereens every time there is a meteorite shower?
Show me the real record of one actually destroying a civilization like the volcanoes of Santorini did to the Minoans of Crete. Or even just one city, town.... heck... I'll take a village or even an outhouse in some farmer's yard.",-0.9377,407
