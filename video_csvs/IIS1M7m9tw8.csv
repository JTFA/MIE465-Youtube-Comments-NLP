"Dear Friends if we make Jesus Christ our personal Lord and Savior... everytime we sin - we have every right to as Jesus Christ to forgive us of our sin(s) - cleanse us as though we have never sinned - so that when our heart stops beating, we can be assured that we wont suffer eternal damnation for our sins. Jesus Christ did what no other human being has ever done or could ever do. He was the ONLY person on this planet who has never sinned. Because He has never sinned, He is the only acceptable sacrifice God the Father would accept to pay ransom payment for each of our sins. That is simply AMAZING isn't it? JESUS DID IT!! Seek Jesus Christ today and receive His FREE GIFT of eternal forgiveness and salvation. May God bless you in the glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. ❤️❤️❤️",0.9822,171

"God bless you! Thank you for spreading awareness! This is my first time seeing your channel! I’ve seen in the comments ppl are mixing anemia with the condition sickle cell disease. The disease is much more complicated and can cause more health problems and hospitalizations if not treated properly. However, you should be fine. Keep warm, drink tons of water take your medications and keep up with regular appts. If you have more questions just ask!

I have sickle cell trait as well! N being a bio major has helped me understand it much more.

In any case I’m glad you went to get checked and are taking the proper steps to get as healthy as possible! And beans help too lol,0.8574,88
I have sickle cell trait but i have never been anemic? Nor have i ever had the symptoms. I just found out about 4 months ago though they didn’t explain it well enough to me but they told me that i had nothing to worry about and left it at that. No I’m concerned for myself 🙂🙃,0.4514,65

"So glad you shared this with us. I have the disease. I have the SC version which it kind of like the mild to moderate version. I've known my entire life and I am 26 now and I have been doing really good managing it annnndd on top of that I had my daughter a year ago and she has the trait. This stuff is no joke. I've cut out all meat and some dairy. Not sure if this has anything to do with managing it, but so far I've done good for 4 years not having severe pain crisis. Crazy that you had to go through this but at least you understand now. Even though you only have anemia, stay away from dry climate areas and the extreme cold and extreme heat can be your worst enemy. Keep your body at a comfortable temperature. Anyways, thanks again for sharing. I was going to make a video about it, but it's just too sensitive for me.",0.8247,182
"Something has called to us all of our days
Whispering of glory and glorious ways
Someone has reached from an infinite space
Found in our hearts the most secretive place
Planted a vision though not clearly seen
For mankind is fallen, mankind is fallen...
Mankind is fallen.
There is a yearning in every heart
Reminding us all who we were from the start
Destined for more than our earthly estate
Heaven may beckon though we're doomed to wait
And so we may search for what truth we can find
For mankind is fallen.
There is a dragon as real as can be
Conquered mankind with the fruit of the tree
And he sees the truth of who we're meant to be
Searching for someone that calls from above
A hero to follow, who worthy of love
Has risen from death and then rolled back the stone
Holds high the sword and then urges us on
To put down the dragon we've served all along
For mankind is fallen.",0.8702,174
