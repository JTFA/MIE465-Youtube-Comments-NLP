"""Absolutely IW could suck""?? That's pretty much a joke. Marvel is going to knock it out of the park because that's what they do. Sure...... Marvel has had a handful of films that haven't been great but none of them were as flat, dreary, disconnecting and dull as most of the DC stuff. I loved WW and enjoyed sections of JL quite a bit but the whole package taken together has been plain bad. The fact that JL did poorly doesn't have anything in common with whether IW will succeed or not. Nothing. Marvel has built on each success (and they have had a bunch of those) and the shared universe they have carefully . They have earned my and millions of others trust. DC earned exactly what they got.",0.9787,147

Kevin answers to Bob now directly. Ike Perlmutter was placed in charge of tv. Which is why the netflix characters where not able to be in any mcu movies. Because of kevin and ike relationship. Now kevin didnt fight for us he fought for his vision. You think he was arguing with perlmutter saying the ""Fans want civil war""?lol that was clearly about his vision. Kevin dont care about a rated R movie. He has a structure that works. Mcu didnt turn into 13 billion dollar company making rated R films.

1. He is pointing out why Marvel will have a much higher chance to succeed as compared to JL. (i.e. strong vs weak foundations)

2. He is saying IW has a POSSIBILITY of sucking; but that he doesn't know because he can't predict the future. Of course, the odds are very much in favour of Marvel succeeding with IW due to how they have had a. A strong foundation b. Strong corporate structure with Feige in the lead to ensure a consistent vision and great characters in great stories. But he is NOT discounting the (no matter how remote) possibility that it could suck. If he said in a cocksure manner that IW will definitely succeed, all you idiot DC fanboys go ""MARVEL PAYS YOU OR WHAT?!"" and now he adds nuance to his argument, all you Marvel fanboys go ""JOHN SUCKS DC'S DICK"" so wtf is he supposed to do?

3. John LIKES all the DCEU films (and he LOVES MoS) but he also acknowledges that the DCEU has its problems and he pointed out what they were 

So please actually use your ears to listen. You may have your own opinions but John isn't advocating indiscriminate Marvel > DC or vice versa. It IS A FACT; i repeat; FACT - that JL was a failure. You can't avoid that. And it definitely breaks his heart more than any of us because he is a DC fan. He loves Marvel films too. BUT ABOVE ALL, HE IS A FAN OF SUPERHERO FILMS.

The point is, Clark MUST know what happened to Bruce's parents.  And hearing Batman going on about his parents at the end of the fight clues him in that it's a sore point--the perfect thing to jolt him.  Hence, ""Martha"".

So he took a risk....a 500 Million Dollar Risk to set up Marvel Studios as a separate brand studio and made the Best use of what Marvel heroes they had left.

Cyborg is a lame character, and should've never been in the film (Green Lantern would have been a better choice for that spot). The actor who plays the Flash isn't nearly as good in the role as Grant Gustin. And, Aquaman was NEVER meant to look like Rob Zombie (Zac Efron would have been a more appropriate choice).

"and yet somehow it fit perfectly within the narrative.

How do you do that? How do you take such a huge story arc in the comic, and make it Personal and emotional for the cast you have on hand?

You do it with good writers, great directors and a producer like Feige, who from the Beginning TOLD fans that it would take inspiration from the comic Civil War, but work it into the MCU narrative.

Which it does perfectly. It makes sense Why each person is on the side they CHOSE for themselves.

In the comicbook it was basically Cap or Iron Man and you pick a side.
In the film, you see and understand WHY they choose their sides.

This is why Civil War worked....where BvS didn't....

Luckily for BvS, it had no competition for box office results.

Imagine, if, like JL and Thor3, that BvS came just 2 weeks before/after Civil War...it wouldn't have made 800 million worldwide at all.",0.8445,189

"ckelcro - If you look at my original post, it was directed towards JL not failing to be a good entertaining movie. I never talked about box office draw. 

When it was brought up that the movie sucked because the average moviegoer didn't go, I said ""Who cares about the average moviegoer? People that saw it can still love it regardless of box office"". I've always argued on behalf of the movie's enjoyable viewing factor. 

Now if we're talking box office and why more people aren't going to see JL, DC has failed in terms of rushing the process. People are excited for Infinity because they've had years to get invested in all the characters.",0.926,127
"ckelcro - No the DCEU is failing because they're trying too hard to emulate Marvel and rush the process. They weren't ready to have a BvsS or Justice League yet. If they'd taken their time developing each hero, using cameos with Cavil/Affleck to build the feud, etc it would've been better. They could've then used BvsS to culminate the feud and have that eventually bring them together for Justice League.

Marvel has given people time to get invested in the characters which is why people care more about Infinity War coming up.",0.7291,101
"ckelcro - Oh come on man. The movie industry as a whole has been losing money for years now. I mean movies are out of theaters within a few months and on Blu-Ray within 6-8 weeks after that in a lot of cases. The fact that you don't have to wait an eternity like you used to have to with VHS and even DVD, gives more people a reason to see movies at home. Especially with ticket prices getting higher and higher. But despite the fact that the industry loses money year after year, movies still get made.",-0.34,106
"ckelcro - This goes back to what I was saying. Our main concern as fans should be how much we enjoyed the movie. If you hate a movie because the story sucked, performances were bad, etc then that is fine.

But when fans start worrying about box office draw which has NOTHING to do with them, it is ridiculous IMO. Do you work for the studio? No. Were you involved in making the movie? No. So what difference does it make how much money it made to you? Just focus on the movie itself.",-0.9318,107

"lol Funny thing is, both movies had the exact same release date of May 5th 2016, with DC announcing the date first since they wanted to hit the summer holiday audiences.

And they did so, knowing that Both Avengers films targeted that weekend, and were very successful. However Feige didn't care and announced Civil War would open on the same day. When he was asked if it was a challenge to DC, he said ""Not at all. If you look at our first major releases of the year, we always target the first weekend of the summer. We did it with Avengers 1 and 2 and we will target it again for civil war.""

Later on, director Joe Russo said in an interview that It wasn't the first time that the MCU fought for the May slot, since they fought with Sony for it previously, and even then, Feige said he wasn't going to move from that date. Hence he predicted that DC would move the release date of BvS.

And they did. They moved it to March 25th, which meant a whole 4 weeks of NO competition at the box office in order to make money.

In retrospect it was a smart move, and is also WHY it made as much as it did.",0.3468,240
