I find that when I do that, the images often look ""fake,"" but you're able to create a scene and a feeling with them.  Did you ever have that issue earlier in your career?  And is that where props and use of grain/noise play in to help with that?  Okay, I guess that's two questions... :)  Keep being awesome!",0.9851,100

So I end up taking photos with props too but those rarely are used by our company. BUT I do maintain our social media, so I shamelessly post them there, without even asking. ;)",-0.0713,98
