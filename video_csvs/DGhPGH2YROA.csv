"I'm honestly awe-struck this is the first performance I have watched from you, and it's utterly amazing where your music transported me. It was like I was there in the movie when each song was played my heart soared. I would lose myself in the music, which is the very core purpose of music. When you played and danced along, you looked so graceful and lost in the music, I just let my mind sway to the music, it was entrancing. You are phenomenal and you probably get that a lot. But you have made these songs into a part of me. Originally these songs have a major sentimental value to me and you just completed and demonstrated the beauty of these songs. Personally, I want to thank you with all my heart, this was amazing.",0.9806,151

"If you watch enough of Lindsey Stirling's videos you can develop a composite picture of what make Lindsey Stirling tick.  Many of her videos carry a message that is based on some details from Lindsey's personal life. What she does is who she is and who she is is what she does. She is equally phenomenal as a person as she is a performer. And Lindsey genuinely loves her fans both Stirlingites and Zeldahites.  And if you pay close enough attention to  her music you might  notice that her songs carry a message that has a high impact on you  and you'll think she wrote the song with you in mind although she doesn't know you personally. Speaking for myself, I find it very easy to love Lindsey Stirling as a person as well as a performer. She is absolutely phenomenal. I've never met another person like her and probably never will. She is The Greatest Showman and a great deal more.",0.9746,173

I dont want to turn this into some cliche comment, but honestly, it will be.
This has by far been one of my favorite covers by you. Not only because The Greatest Showman has been one of my favorite movies, but the way you channel your emotions.

I cannot put into words how shocked and emotionally in awe I am, and I can guarentee that I may have shed a tear or two. This was absolutely beautiful- thank you!",0.9808,107

You can look up ANY concert violinist (Hilary Hahn and Janine Jensen for starters) and they will be leagues ahead of Lindsey.  The teens in the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competitions are better than her.  You want to see incredible performances?  Just watch those.",0.9017,91
