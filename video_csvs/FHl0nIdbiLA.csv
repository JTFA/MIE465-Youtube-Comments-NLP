"I usually enjoy the Adam Ruins Everything videos, but this one is bullshit.
1. Researchers don't use lab mice because they are convenient. In fact, it is expensive and labor-intensive to keep lab animals and do tests on them, compared to in-vitro methods.
2. 20 % ""success rate"" is really not that much, true. But, sadly, it is the best you can get right now. I guess no one would turn down life-saving medication when needed because animals died because of these, at least I would not be willing to ""wait"" (and die) until there are better models that wipe out animal testing.
3. What's your alternative? No, you can't ""just use human cells"" and then you're ready with glamourously applicable results. They don't interact and behave like they would in the whole organism and you also can't study the effects of a compound on the whole organism. Both in-vitro and in-vivo methods complement eachother.
4. The video suggests that researchers could do anything they want with lab animals and get away with it. That's not true. The authorities control every fart that sneaks out of your butthole when it comes to animal testing. I know that the video is exaggerated for humourous reasons but I think it is dangerous to undermine the trustworthiness of researches for bad arguments.
5. There is lots(!!!) of research on alternative methods. In-vitro methods are way more convenient and much cheaper than animal testing. As said, they are complementary but they are still far far away from being reliable enough to replace animal testing completely. There are problems in biopharmaceutical research (e.g. lots of failed approaches, a really long time until a project is finished, awfully high costs) but eliminating animal testing would not solve any of these but worsen them.
6. Every researcher and probably every goddamn idiot in the world knows that mice and humans are different. Every researcher knows about the limitations of animal testing (and other methods too, of course). Researchers try to use a method that fits their needs (on information) the best. Unfortunately, a lab animal is the most reliable model right now. Might change someday but lots of research have to be done until that day.",-0.9864,433

Well Adam, I think that this time there is a bit of an issue here.
Let's start from the beginning. The medical research!(I come from Europe, so there are slight differences between our nations, but anyway there are more point in common that differences)
There are some steps you have to do before to put in the market a drug:

Preclinc studies and 4 steps of clinical studies. I won't explain everything. Let's stick to preclinic studies, so the studies on animals.


Preclinic studies: in vitro essays in which it have to be demonstrated that the molecule that have been found has the actual activity that it was searched. At the very beginning no animals involved, usually are cell cultures and other systems, like transwell and other mechanics simulators of certains organs or tissues. Now, when and if the cell cultures (that in this case are the most interesting on the actual activity of the drug) give some good results, there we come to mice or in other cases on rats, hamsters or other animals. But as you said, the 95% of animals used are mice. So let's stick on mice. 
Why mice? Because in this period of history, the ethic way to think is through specism. Specism means that we find more or less ethic to do the same thing on different species. If you do brain surgery to a mouse is more important than if you do it to a fish, but is way less important than to do the same thing on a cat or an ape. So there are yet some things that you cannot do on other species.
Now: you said that doing experiments on mice is not very predictive of the effects on humans. 
That IS absolutely right. But it is a model. With all the limits of a model. We can simulate the experiments in silico, but it is a model too, and the level of failures are more than on mice. Unfortunately there is a very important difference from any single model and the reality on human body. When you use mice, there are for real some really good things, that I think have been minimised in this video.
The possibility to use more of them for example. You know how many subjects are needed to have a statistical significant studies? Well, guess: a lot!You can do a single experiment with more than 100 mice. If you want a more specific model, you should use directly apes or men. Well. you would use for real men to test a brand new drug? Or directly on apes? Is not like if we would not use mice, we should use less subjects? Every year we should need millions or apes or millions of human beings to run the experiments. Can you immagine millions of cages for apes? A mouse needs more or less 35 square cm. An ape a whole room!  

There is almost nothing that is incorrect in which you said about number and theory, because it's true. But are the conclusions that lacks of informations. And some insinuations. 

""everyone knows that testing on rodents is practically the same as doing actual human trials""
Who ever said that? In which article is written that? If in science we would have thought that, you think we would pass through preclinical to 4 different clinical studies? And if we thought that you think that we would for real involve different species?

""Yeah, we are out of founding, well then tell cancer patients tey'll have to wait""
That is deeply unfair. I know that the name of the show is Adam Ruins Everything, but this is no prove of anything. Is not supported by anything, is only a way to throw shit on a whole cathegory of worker. Becouse like this you are saying that mice are completely useless, and without them we could invest money on something more precise and more usefull and, like in this case, some illness could have been cured yet. But it does not work like this. Go and search the ""Stamina Method"", a plague that afflicted Italy, and even though there are those steps to do (preclinical studies, clinical studies befor putting on the market the drug), Mr Vannoni did not followed it. With catastophic events after. Mice are usefull. In this video there is not a clue nor a hint about how we should do research without mice. The answer is there is no other possible way. One day we will be able to do everything in silico. I do not know when, maybe in 50, 100 or 500 years but surely we will. Just up till then we will need mice. 

And none of the scientits I worked with ever said, not even once, ""everyone knows that testing on rodents is practically the same as doing actual human trials"", I never heard about this illusion of we and them being the same. If you speak for the ""common sense"", you are right, most of peaple thinks so. In that case you should have not wear the girl with a lab coat, because the first thing most of peaple will feel about it is the assosiation between what she said and what she wear, thinking that for real scientists think this.  So you can say, and scream out loud how much is wrong, and how fare are mice from human. In the same time, you should explain that they are as well usefull. 

You spoke about the simplicity to change the genome in a mouse. And that is not at all of secondary importance. Let's say that you think that a molecule A interacts with a receptor B. You can see that when you inject A you see the activation on the effectors downstream of B. But Is there any hint about the fact that is my specific receptor that does the whole thing? Or A interacts with other receptor? I can know out a mice (to delete or modify a single gene) and take out B. If my molecule has no other effects A interacts only with B. If there are, so I have to search the other effectors, and the other receptors that can interact with A. It is very easy with mice, with rats is quite difficult, but feasable, with other species almost impossible. Science is done with mice today, and you cannot immagine another model. Is not perfect, but for basic research are still good. If you do this kind of objection for mice, you should do it for everything except humans. But in that case (that should be perfect for pure science) there should be a most important issue about ethics, don't you think? And yes, on the whole body there will be a lots of differences with human, but yet you start to understand the functions of a molecule in a biomolecular and biochemical way.

We could speak about the fact this is only a show, and that's all. You need only to find follower, to say something explosive to blow peaple's mind, and that's all. And that there are lots of things way less scientific and ignorant things that run on the internet, because at least you say things that are completely and absolutely true. And still even though what you say is true, this is a very important topic. And delicate. In this period in Europe (i don't know in US, but I think there are the same problems) there are lots of problems to do propper research. Because this idea that doing research without animals is spreading all the way. Is true that mice are not the perfect model (I am totally agree with that), but is the best way to work in this world and not in the hyperuranion. 
Speaking as an informer means that you should (of corse) say the truth, but even to give a gateway to deaply understand it. Otherwise you can make them to think what you want.There is a photo that runs on the internet of a laboratory in which there are dozens of cats tied to several tables. And in this photo there is written that those poor cats have been dissected. And no, it is not like that. Is a picture of some vets, that are saving those cats that belonged to a old lady that died, and the corps have been found after a week, and all those cats were hers. Those vets took all those cats that were ill (not all of them, but several) and cure them for free. The picture have been used to demonstrate something no true at all, against research and medical progress. The picture was true, the conclusion were compleately wrong.
I do belive that you usually speak the truth, in a very interesting and funny way. This time you probably said too much, or you should propose a new way to organise science in an affordable way...",0.9808,1710

"No shit mouse models aren't a perfect fit for humans.

This video lacks even a basic understanding or acknowledgement of the constraints of studying science in the real world, and pretends that scientists are ignorant of the limitations of their study methods.

This is honestly the video equivalent of people who jump out with ""correlation doesn't equal causation"" anytime they see results of an observational study, as if they've uncovered some fatal flaw in research that 8 doctors with combined decades of experience in their field didn't see while reading the headline on reddit. 

Do you know why we don't just keep a basement full of gimps to shoot up random research chemicals into? Ethics and economics. You can do so many more mouse studies for the cost of a single human one, and even if 80% of those don't pan out in humans, you would have gathered so much more knowledge than if you did it otherwise. You also would have subjected far fewer people to drugs that would either not work or cause harm.  

It's really easy to say ""Let's just use human cells to do it then"". Making disease-specific models using human cells is not a trivial task, and the cost of using human cells, even if the protocols exist, is not small either. Let's not even mention the ethical and legal hurdles (HeLa, fetal tissue, etc.). I would really love to see how you propose to conduct 99% of the studies which use mouse models under the constraint of time, staff, and grant funding. 

Is this perfect? No. I'm all for challenging the way we do things (and we are by developing new human-model protocols), but you haven't even done your due diligence in investigating the problem here to offer an informed opinion. 

Cherry-picking articles you didn't bother to read to make a video about a topic you do not fully understand is not only lazy, it's dangerous. The amount of people citing this video as law in posts around the internet is testament to how quickly this misinformation spreads among the people who watch your show. These people believe the false premise that all mouse models are useless and shouldn't be trusted, and that the only ""real"" research is done on human test subjects. This is a myth that you have a hand in creating, not unlike the anti-vaxxer movement. This not only further distances the public from academia, but makes it harder to fund the sort of studies you yourself are suggesting are better using federal grants.

"Not sure if anyone else has commented this, but saying that the animal welfare act doesn't protect mice is technically true, but very misleading to say that alone. I've worked with mice on multiple occasions at a hospital that does federally funded research. If a scientist works at any institute that gets funding through grants (which nearly exclusively all do, because there's not just some rich scientist shelling out all the money for all their expensive experiments), they must complete a proposal on their methods, and show that they are using either a non-harmful or the least cruel effective method possible for their work. If they don't comply, they don't get funding, and if not meeting the criteria of least cruel methods, their proposal is rejected and they need to make another with altered methods. You also have to argue why mice are the best test model for your line of work, and it being the cheapest method (as the video implies is the reason for their use) is not an argument that will be accepted; plus, mice aren't even always cheap, mice bred for specific genomes can be incredibly expensive unless you have a huge research lab that does tons of mice studies, so they have their own in-house breeding colony. This video also ignores that frequent training must be done on how to work with animals (with the training being specific to certain kinds of animals, and mice having their own special training) to make sure that the experimenter does not cause avoidable stress to the animal, and the training must be redone every year or 2. While this isn't the only misleading argument in the video, I feel like the comments have covered the others.",0.9746,317

In science you rarely ever get something right the first time. Mistakes and errors teach us just as much as successes. Experimentation on mice is far cheaper, easier and more controllable than experimentation on human beings, and obviously though success on mice isn’t a guarantee of success on humans, failure on mice is probably indicative of failure on humans. There’s a reason we don’t approve drugs just because they work on mice. This is only the first step.",0.4417,126
