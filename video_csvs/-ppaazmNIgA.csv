"(From Slaves of Sin to Slaves of God):

Do you not know that
to whom you present yourselves
slaves to obey,

you are that one’s slaves
whom you obey,
whether of sin
leading to death,

or of obedience
leading to righteousness?

(Romans 6:16).

***(Slaves to obey): Paul highlights the principle that everyone is a slave to someone or something---whether it is a person, possession, or activity, But a Christian should be a slave to God's righteousness.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Present your body's members unto servants of righteousness, which leads to Holiness): 


I speak in human terms 


because of the weakness of your flesh. 


For just as you 
presented your members 
as slaves of uncleanness, 


and of lawlessness 
leading to more lawlessness, 


so now present your members 


as slaves of righteousness 


for holiness.


(Romans 6:19). 


***(In Human Terms): Refers to Paul's illustration of slavery. The analogy of slavery to the Christian life is imperfect, because Christians are God's children. 


***Having been set free from sin and having become a slave of righteousness, the believer should serve righteousness just as he or she served sin before trusting Christ. The result will be holiness. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(From Slaves of Sin to Slaves of God):

But now

having been
set free from sin,
and having become
slaves of God,

you have your fruit
to holiness,
and the end,
everlasting life

(Romans 6:22).

***(Free from Sin): The new relationship with God results in a new person, which makes a new kind of fruit possible: RIGHTEOUSNESS.

***Christians have been freed from sin so that they can be given eternal life.",-0.9843,326

Jackie a to reply to all you little girls since every single one of you are trying to say it's an emergency #1 Scott never has the kids over night unless kourt is out of town I watch the show faithfully #2 kourt a made it clear that Scott calls her saying 90% of the time is him trying to get back with her but she doesn't want to #3 she has a boyfriend her baby father isn't her concern anymore hence her wanted to move on and she stated that in the show as well she even admitted that she needs to learn to not pick up his calls #4 she clearly says in the video he called her at 2 am to talk about them and what's they're doing. So all if you trying to argue it could be an emergency it clearly isn't and never is and kourt has security at her house and assistants they could do more than Scott could he's never in the country anyway he's to busy hanging out with is 21 years old girlfriend so get your facts right I clearly have mine and she needs to stop picking up his calls and making it seem he has a chance cause he's taking it as an indicator that they could get back together cause she's still picking up her phone at 2 am when she has a boyfriend,0.8949,242
