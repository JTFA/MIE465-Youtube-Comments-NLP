"I've read a lot of comments from those wanting Wendy and Axe to get it together. Nooooo! I think that would ruin their dynamic, never to be repaired. In my opinion their relationship is above any basic sexual desire and I think the writers wanted to show us that with the ""naked in the pool"" scene. 

We already know that Lara and Bobby have great sex, so Lara doesn't feel threatened on that level but Wendy gives Axe something that his wife can't. They share an intellectual connection which makes the struggle for Lara more interesting to watch. He is in free fall without Wendy's guidance, he needs her and Lara feels as though she can't compete.",0.9125,129
