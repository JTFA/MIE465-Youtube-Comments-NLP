"Absolutely. The movie producers and Atlantic had to decide which one they want to make an official single and they chose Keala's version, I guess because she is the original artist and they want to give her some exposure, but Kesha's version would have done well on radio, Keala's does not (yet). Kesha's version probably won't get a music video, simply because it would draw the attention away from Keala's version, but I'd also like to get one.",0.7814,88
