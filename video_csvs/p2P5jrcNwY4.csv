"Some of these analyst and trolls have low basketball iq's. Lonzo is already showing signs of being special but the hate is great. When he became the youngest player ever to have a triple double, surpassing Lebron James record, you can see Lonzo is special. What other rookie has done that? I'm waiting! I think that is special and is the sign of greatness to come. He has also showed signs in other stats. For instance, he has had a game of 16 rebounds (although 6'6 weighing 190lbs), he had a 13 assist game (not even playing with a superstar), he had 2 games with 5 steals, he had 2 games with 4 blocks. Lonzo has the potential to be a top all around player in this league. Some of these rookies can only do 1 thing like score or rebound. Lonzo can do it all. Some of you don't understand the point guard position is the toughest to learn and Lonzo is doing it without having 1 star on his team to help him get there. He is playing with other rookies. See Tatum has Kyrie who is the leader so all he has to do is score. Ben Simmons has Embiid and can get 5 assist a game from him. Lonzo doesn't have a star to guide him. I think some of you want instant success but some rookie players you just look for signs in the 1st year and Lonzo has already shown that and is improving each day. Go view the highlights of Lonzo recent games on the road against the Knicks or the Cavs. Giannis came in the league in 2013. What year is it? When it's all said and done, you all will witness what Lebron already knows is coming, greatness. He is just advising Lonzo to stay focused on the game, block out the outside noise, and he will be just fine.",0.977,357
