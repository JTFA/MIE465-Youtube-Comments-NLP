"(((((((My Aunts near death experience, I would like to share with all my friends ÔÅä ))))))).

I was 19 going in for an operation to remove my thyroid. After a week, I went to the doctor for a check-up. Because of an experience I had, I wanted to ask the doctor a question. The doctor came over and sat next to me and I asked him, ‚ÄúDid I die on the operating table?‚Äù He put his arm around me and said yes! I had to confirm it because of my experience. 

My parents refused to talk to me. My mother, after I told her of my experience said that the doctor came out and told her that I had died during the operation. My mom went to the truck and told my dad and he said to never talk about it again which it was not. My dad never talked to me about it. 

I remember standing on the side watching everything, hearing the doctors everything going on in the operating room. And I saw myself lying there and I heard the doctor saying she‚Äôs gone. 

Right after he said that I found myself going down a tunnel towards a very bright light. I felt so at peace and so content. As I got closer to the light, I saw JESUS standing there in his WHITE ROBE with his arms stretched out and telling me, ‚ÄúNo not now go back, not now, go back.‚Äù The next thing I knew I was choking, waking up. So Michael, if anyone you run into that does not believe in Jesus tell them my story, for HE IS REAL!!!

***My Aunt was the first one who took me to the store, when I was in High School and bought me my first own Bible!!!

(Dead to Sin, Alive to God. The false notion that a believer in Christ Jesus can keep on sinning all they want and still be under God grace, which was abhorrent to Paul!):

What shall we say then? 

Shall we continue in sin, 

that grace may abound? 

God forbid. 

How shall we, 

that are dead to sin, 

live any longer 

therein?

(Romans 6:1-2).

***Since sin in a way makes grace more abundant (See verses 5:20-21) why not continue in sin? This is certainly a possible conclusion, though a wrong one, from the teaching about grace in Ch 5. 

Apparently Paul had been accused of teaching this false doctrine, called antinomianism, to silence his accusers, 

(Theologically, antinomianism is the belief that there are no moral laws God expects Christians to obey. Antinomianism takes a biblical teaching to an unbiblical conclusion.The unbiblical conclusion is that there is no moral law God expects Christians to obey.) 

Paul shows in this chapter that a believer who continues in sin would be denying his or her own identity in Christ.

***(Certainly not): The Greek expresses a response of shock, that has even been translated ""God forbid.""

The thought of a believer living in sin in order to take advantage of grace was abhorrent to Paul. 

The reason believers should not live in sin is that they have died to sin, as it is explained in verses 3 and 4. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Dead to Sin, Alive to God, walking in a newness of life. Old things have pass and behold all has become new!):

Therefore we are buried with him 
by baptism into death:

that like as Christ was raised up 
from the dead 

by the glory of the Father,
even so we also
should walk in newness of life.

For if we have been 
planted together 
in the likeness of his death,

we shall be also 
in the likeness 
of his resurrection:

(Romans 6:4-5).

***(Newness of life): If the believer's identification with Christ means being identified with His death, then it logically follows that the believer also identifies with Jesus resurrection. Having died and having been raised with Christ, the believer should live a new kind of life.

***(2 Corinthians 5:17):Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

***(1 Peter 1:14-16): As obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance, but as He who called you is Holy, you also be Holy in all your conduct, because it is written, ""Be Holy, for i am Holy.""

***(Galatians 5:16): This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Dead to Sin, Alive to God. The believer is no longer enslaved to his or her sin):

Knowing this,

that our old man 
is crucified with him,

that the body of sin 
might be destroyed,

that henceforth
we should not serve sin.

For he that is dead
is freed from sin.

(Romans 6:6-7).

***Simply put, a believer is not the same person he or she was before conversion; a believer is a new creation in Christ.

***(Freed): The idea is that the believer no longer has any obligation to sin.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Dead to Sin, Alive to God. Continued):

Do not present 
the parts of your body 

to sin 
as instruments 
of unrighteousness,

but present 
yourselves to God
as those who have been 
brought from death to life;

and present 
the parts of your body 
to Him 
as instruments 
of righteousness.

For sin 
shall not have dominion 
over you:

for ye are not 
under the law, 
but under grace.

(Romans 6:13-14).

***The sin principle is still present and can express itself through the mortal body, the body that is subject to death.

***The difference is that sin has no right to reign. Thus Paul admonishes the believer not to OBEY IT!

***God's grace places the believer in Christ, and the Holy Spirit in the believer. Therefore a Christian does not have to sin, he or she can resist temptation and do what is right.

***(2 Corinthians 3:15-18)<---But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

***(1 Corinthians 10:13)<---There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.",-0.9961,1364

"I have an implant, and would like to share my story about how I got it and why. In 2014, I filed a patent application on a method to make Tobacco that fights Cancer. The basic process is soaking the Tobacco in distilled water, straining, and repeating until the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) of the run-off water reaches zero (or the water is as clear as possible if guessing). Then do the same with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol (TDS can't be measured with alcohol. Evaportate a drop on a mirror and look for residue if no equipment or soak/strain with alcohol until run-off is clear). Wear gloves if you do this anti-carcinogen process. These liquid Tobacco extracts can kill you, especially the first distilled water wash. When the Tobacco is  completely dry and ALL of the alcohol is evaporated off, microwave the Tobacco for 7 or 8 seconds to destroy any radioactive metals such as Lead and Polonium. To the finished product, Cannabis extract is added by liquidating it with 91% or 99% Isopropyl Alcohol, and the tobacco absorbs it all up. Alternatively Nicotine, CBD, and flavoring can be added. This is tobacco that prevents Cancer, and this patent is a monopoly on the Tobacco AND Marijuana industry at the same time. 
A girl from Mansfield, OH knew about my idea and seemingly got pregnant on purpose, then instantly dumped me. She just so happened to be the sister of a Sheriff Deputy there, and police chased me out of Mansfield after attacking me and tazing me. My paternity case can be seen by searching for Richland County Ohio public records. I have 2 paternity cases, this one was finalized in 2016. You will notice months and months of continuations on the case, which buys time for the patent application to mature (3-5 years) as well as buy time for the contractors to hold on to my case. 
I live in Ashland, OH now and I'm almost certain the mom filed a child support hearing stating that I wasn't claiming all of my income and she had proof. Ashland Police pulled me over, searched my car and found weed, then used that to get a search warrant for my home. While in my home, they searched my records for financial proof of her claim, and while there took my weed and my book of patent ideas. After finding proof of an unclaimed recurring payment, you are guilty even if the ""income"" was just a family member giving you cash twice in 1 year to help you with food. 
Since I have PTSD, the judge can find me NGBRI (Not guilty by reason of insanity). This means I can be placed on probation and hooked up to forensic monitoring to make sure I don't hide any more income, which allows all of my thoughts and ideas to be seen and taken. Luckily, I accidently found my implant. I woke up one morning and I heard a constant ringing noise, and I felt like I had a hangover. My vision was also kind of hazy....almost like there was tiny pixels. I'm not sure if there is a device hooked to my optic nerve, or if they did a lens implant. Lens implants do permantent damage to your eyes, because they shatter your natural lenses and replace it with a hydrogel that solidifies which is made into a camera lens. The old school technology is in the form of a contact lens such as ""Google Lens"". The actual implant would be more like ""Google Lens Implant"". 
When I looked in the mirror, there was a tiny piece of skin (or so I thought) hanging from my upper left nostril. When I pulled it off, it bled uncontrollably. The piece of skin was actually a clear bandage covering an incision. When I looked at my other upper nostril, there was one there too. Upon examining my nose, there was a bump shaped like a piece of rice on the bridge of my nose. If I pull down on my skin I can see it, and I can always feel it with my finger. If i lightly push on it, it's uncomfortable. There is also a bump on the inside of each upper nostril.
I am almost positive my case got contracted out to my local University to the Criminal Justice class. They monitor everything I think or do, and cause me physical and mental pain every day all day long. They are doing this to take the blame away from the mom they are using to get the patent, so it looks like it's the goverment messing with me over Tobacco. Some of the people in this class are old friends of mine that joined the class just so they could be part of the monitoring. These same friends introduced me to my patent attorney, who needed a Power of Attorney over my patent to represent me in patent court. Once I signed that, my life went straight to hell. My case is actually on the Ashland, OH Municipal court public records. The charge they used was telecom harassment, but it was actually over child support/paternity. They do that to protect the mom. If searching for this case it was in April/May of 2016. If you look at the conditions of release from jail, you will see that I had to be equipped with ""GPS"". I obviously did get equipped with something that has GPS capabilities, but they didn't tell me where it was being equipped and I didn't get an ankle bracelet. You will also notice a specific guys name in the case requiring me to stay away from him. He pops up FREQUENTLY in my life, and introduced me to my attorney. He is also friends with the mom in my case.
What my theory is, by using child support laws to monitor me and force various child support laws, IV-D services are utilized through child support. All of these services are paid for by the state. The longer it goes on, the more money the state loses. The state gets their money for child support services through federal grants. This means they are attacking both the state and the federal government financially, until ""I"" get the patent. Then when ""I"" get it, they will offer me an unfair amount for it and torture me until I agree.
After years of trying to figure out how to make the torture stop, I finally figured out that they can keep monitoring me until I file perfectly accurate numbers with child support (I am self employed). That means including any cash deals or any recurring payments I received more than once in a year. I filed my own request for an administrative review through child support, and used overly accurate numbers. My adjustment is scheduled for January 24, 2017. Once it takes place, the child support contractors will lose their contract (their power over me) and must get their equipment back. Now that I know where the equipment is, it will be very hard for them to get it back without me knowing. This is how they are stuck:
First, they have to get permission from me to remove the equipment or it's a lawsuit since the contract will be over when they try to remove it. My rights will be restored at that point, and all patients have a right to know about any medical prodedures done to their body, and any possible side effects. Second, I placed a service offer ad on Craigs List offering my body for research using any sort of brain monitoring equipment for $2 billion with no written contract necessary. Let me tell you, they are PISSED! I was kept awake until 7am this morning with random pains in my brain, my testicles, and my teeth (I have no cavities). I also felt nausea, itching all over my body, and voices contantly talking shit like ""how do your nuts feel?"" and ""you will NOT mess this up for us!"". 
If I win this lawsuit, it will be a powerful movement for TI's everywhere. If you have an implant and it's active, I can almost guarantee you it's money fed unless you have mental issues or are involved in illegal activities. Look into if you are doing something wrong with child support, federal or local taxes, or if you have been to any sort of mental institution. 
Keep your head up folks and educate yourself. Most implants are non-invasive which means they are under your skin and not attached to your brain like most think. Research ""Non-invasive brain computer interface"". This will be a good start on your quest of understanding. If you have some extra cash on hand and want immediate relief, look into building a Faraday cage. A Faraday cage made PROPERLY will block all radio frequencies inside the cage. Many build one around their bed. To take it a bit further, a device called a frequency counter finds the frequency of radio transmissions. Higher end models will be more likely to locate the implant, as they have a broader frequency range and are more sensitive. For best results, scan your body with the frequency counter inside of the Faraday cage. Most implants run on 2.4 Ghz. The reason is WiFi and Bluetooth are both 2.4Ghz, which makes transmission from you to the internet effortless. 
Many people turn to religion in this situation which is understandable. There is nothing wrong with that, but don't expect God to fix this for you. The best thing you can do is look at this as God is trying to make you stronger and wiser. You must survive this test, and teach yourself how to do so by educating yourself. This message is the beginning of that for you if you let it be.",0.9779,1857
