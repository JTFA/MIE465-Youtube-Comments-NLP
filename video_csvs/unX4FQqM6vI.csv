I love the analogy of thoughts being birds in the sky of your mind. Just because there are birds doesn't mean you cant see the sky. Keeping this in mind while meditating fosters a loving yet detached relationship to your thoughts that was very help full in helping me be mind full this morning (a little bit of bird song out side my window made the experience even more pleasant).,0.9152,75

"This is still derived from the idea that the mind is a kind of computer. And if that's so, one could 'reprogram' it. It's a popular thought, of course, in this day and age. Still, I wonder whether it's true and therefore if these 'tools' and methods will work. It might not be more valuable than self-hypnosis or forcing yourself to think 'positive thoughts'.",0.7528,79

"i not sure teaching meditation as saying ''let ideas pass as they come'' is a good way to teach. Because you can have ideas that says ''my back hurts'' for instance, ideas that are vital and need a reaction. In opposition with more mondaine or random thoughts.",0.4833,59
