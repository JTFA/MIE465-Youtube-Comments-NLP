"Don't be cheap. Let them both come back as co-Champions. Since this was the first time in the 2 years (400 + or - games) that there has been a tie. One out of 400 is a coincidence, not a pattern that needs to be dealt with,  or because of gamesmanship. You have it set up so that no one knows what another person is betting, so you can't play any head games about intentionally going for a tie. There are WAY too many variables that work against having a tie (your score, how you bet on the final question, your knowledge of the category).

Sure, In the Tournament of Champions, it makes sense to keep the ""gameplay brisk and competitive"" since they are playing for $100,000, AND it being a two day final. But it makes no sense to have it for the regular play. It only shows that the producers are cheap and don't want to pay for two champions rather than just the $2,000 for being in 2nd place.

"Don't know about the huddling, but you're right that the shows are edited.

The game ran long, and he damned near didn't make it (apparently, he ended up buttoning his shirt while he was walking from the ""green room"" to the actual studio, and didn't have time to put on a tie before he was announced).  And I've read that Judy Garland cut it closer than that.

In the final episode, they announced that, in an emergency when a mystery guest couldn't make it, host John Daly would have been the mystery guest (which he was on that final episode)",-0.9366,179

If she had done that, she would have had $23,200.  Had the woman who was leading bet $8200, she _also_ would have had $23,200.

By betting $8201, she was guaranteed to win if she got the final question right.  With the second woman betting the amount she did, she was guaranteed to win if she got the question right, and the woman leading either got it wrong, or got it right but only bet a token amount (which people leading sometimes do if they're not confident in their knowledge on that subject).
