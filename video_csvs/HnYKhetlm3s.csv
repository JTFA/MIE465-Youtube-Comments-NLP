She lost out on gold because Oksana out-skated her. I do agree that Tonya was a victim of circumstance and I think that the reason that people struggle to feel sympathetic for her, apart from the media sensationalising the Tonya vs Nancy story, is because she refused to back down and be a victim of abuse.

I am sure she has had to do this all her life, stand up for herself and rise above those who feel they are better than her and need to remind her of her place. Here is a kid who did everything she could to overcome the white trash stigma.  It is a reminder to us all that you are judged by those you choose to associate with.

"Let's be honest, Piers Morgan has a point. I  dislike him as much as the next person, I think he's arrogant and pretentious . But Nancy WAS the real victim in the entire story. Whether Tonya knew about what her husband was planning or not, the truth is that HER HUSBAND destroyed the dreams of a young Olympic athlete with what he did. If I was Tonya, the MOMENT I found out what my husband did (whether I was to blame or not), I would publicly apologize to Nancy. Do we know if Nancy would have beat Tonya if she hadn't been attacked? No. But there is a reason that the guy planned it, and I have a feeling that it was because Tonya was VERY insecure about her chances against Nancy.

Nancy played it up just as much as Tonya tried to play it down I am sure.

"The movie is based on Tonya Harding's version - exclusively!  In reality, the evidence implicating Tonya Harding is overwhelming:
1. Tonya called the Massachusetts rink (where the attack was originally scheduled to take place) 4 times to find out Kerrigan's practice schedule.
2. She wrote the name and address of the same rink on the back of an envelope.  The plotters threw a garbage bag of evidence into a dumpster, but police recovered it with the envelope inside.
3. Gillooly has been honest about his role in the attack.  He could have fingered Harding as the main planner, but instead owned up to his role as the originator of the plan.  That earns a lot of credibility.  He says that Harding was fully involved, period.
4. In fact, Gillooly, Eckhardt, Stant, and Smith had stories that were consistent and matched the physical evidence.  And then there's Harding, who contradicts absolutely all of that.
5. Harding claimed she'd never been to Eckhardt's house, where much of the plot took shape.  Then video surfaced of Harding walking out of Eckhardt's house.
6. She also claimed that she barely knew Eckhardt and resented his presence.  Then video emerged of her saying how wonderful Eckhardt was and how safe he made her feel.
7. Harding changed numerous aspects of her story throughout.  For example, where she was when the attack happened.  She saw it on TV, no, she was sleeping and they woke her up to tell her.
8. To this day she can't get her story straight.  For decades she claimed the attack came out of the blue, now she says she overheard them plotting.

Why would Tanya apologize? She didn’t hit her or have her hit.,0.1027,16
Why would her ex husband go up to that girl and hit her in the leg? It's obvious to any half wit that Tonya is guilty.,-0.4215,28

Yes she abused by her mom and husband but Jesus Christ it’s still not fair to Nancy to ignore the fact that she was attacked. And she was aware I don’t care what no one says.,-0.8173,42
"You don't apologize for things you never did. I'm glad Tonya did not directly apologize Bc she had very little to apologize for - she also DID make a public apology ANYWAY- without unduely admitting fault- and her skating career was also destroyed for LIFE. It was as if they gave her a death sentence - her Mother didn't give her an education- she pressured her to drop out of high school to focus on skating- she was trying to BANK on her own daughters success. So it was the only professional skill Tonya had developed. I'm glad Tonya survived anyway- and found her husband and is happy with her family now- AND that she is likely now getting more income from all the media from the film- she deserves to finally get a break, and to be vindicated.",0.0798,152
