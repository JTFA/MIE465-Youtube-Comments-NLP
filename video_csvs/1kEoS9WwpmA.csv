The toy
“My brother Simon and I are very good friends. We play together every day!We play hide-and-seek, to be policemen, to be cowboys... but never to be soldiers. Grandpa doesn’t want that. He says that war is too much scaring. He says it’s not a funny game. We also have a good time when we become explorers. Simon is the older one, so he always decides where we must go. Today he has chosen the garret, even if Granny doesn’t want us to go there without her. I really don’t understand why; there are so many good toys up here! The most beautiful is this arrows shooter, a kind of crossbow. I found it first, so it’s mine. Simon wanted it and that’s why I challenged him.We are Far West cowboys. There is a lot of dust. Horses are drinking water. The sun is hot. The arrow is ready.One step, two steps, three steps... bang!I won, but Simon... I think he felt bad about my victory, because he’s not talking to me anymore. He jumped on the floor and laid down, ignoring me. I think he is asleep right now.Shhh. Grandpa and Granny are looking for us; maybe they heard the match. When they will find us, it will be Simon to explain why we are here, in the garret. I simply followed him, I’m the youngest!So I just have to wait for him to wake up. Simon? ...Simon?”",0.8163,326
