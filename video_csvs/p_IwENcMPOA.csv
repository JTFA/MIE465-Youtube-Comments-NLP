"Looks like she's been his Cheerleader for all those years, he took that for granted that she would always be there for him. And when she couldn't wait around for him any longer to man up with his half hearted attempt to admit his feelings to her. She got a life of her own, and he realised what he lost. And his football wrapped up in her tie died shirt was his way of showing her what she meant to him all those years. She was the best part of his life.",0.6705,99
