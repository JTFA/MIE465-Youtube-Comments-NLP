"*Everything wrong in this video:*

1.""Hi I'm Ajit Pai, I'm the Chairman of the FCC.""
2.Ajit Pai says that he has a plan to *restore* internet freedom.
3.He puts some kind of sauce on top of flamming hot Cheetos on top of some type of food.
4.The top of the bottle seems to be *invisible*, which probably means that it is green with the green screen background.
5.He proceeds to take pictures of his bizarre food creation. 
6.He kisses the poor dog on the mouth, before the dog looks at us like it wants us to save it from this evil person and feels uneasy about being in his arms afterwards. (That laugh sounds evil asf)
7.He is excited about getting fidget spinners for Christmas, even though fidget spinners should pretty much be dead by now.
8.He wears the eclipse glasses like he thinks he's cool and shit.
9.And is that a toy gun I see in your hand? Geez how old are you? 45 or 12?
10.Ajit Pai seems to enjoy staring at the green screen while eating popcorn.
11.Lmfao the lightsaber looks so bad that it is hard to not cringe while watching him swing around a badly edited lightsaber beam. *A Jedi you are NOT.*
12.Ajit Pai and his lame friends perform the Harlem Shake, which was a trend that has been dead for years. (Just found out that Filthy Frank made this meme, *RIP TVFilthyFrank 2013-2017*)
13.He and the others laugh for no apparent reason at all. I mean, what's funny about net neutrality being taken away from millions of people who support net neutrality? Ugh... Even the creators of the internet said that he should be stopped...",-0.5348,327
