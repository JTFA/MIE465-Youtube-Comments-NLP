Hi Kris .You've turned your heatrae sadia hot water cylinder into a potential  bomb. Its an absolute no no to connect these directly to solid fuel heat sources without an energy cutout device(that would be the motorised valve that was supplied with the cylinder and you absolutely HAVE to fit) .It is one of your 3 primary safety devices that the training courses constantly bang on about.This is why you have to be registered to fit these. I would suggest you edit this section out of your video or it could be in danger of being used on one of those unvented training courses that us plumbers have to sit periodically on how not to install one.Its very clear about this in this installation manual. Lots of videos on youtube of unvented cylinders exploding.I suggest you fit a buffer tank and you HAVE to fit that motorised valve that they supplied you,0.2451,162

Thanks for your concern but you are misunderstanding the system. it is fed by my own water source by gravity. it is not connected to mains. so in the event of pressure buildup the water can be pushed back up the hill it is only 10psi so there is no way it can build more than 10 psi of pressure without venting back up hill. and in the event of a blocked pipe i have a pressure relief valve.  so it isnt a bomb at all. but thanks again for your concern.,-0.4867,99

"What's up with everyone in the comments saying this isn't off grid?  If you can live your life without paying a bill to get rid of sewage, to buy water, to turn on the lights or heat your home then you are living off grid.  

If you want to have internet then great, if you don't then great.  It doesn't matter, you still are technically off the grid.  Even if you got tanks of natural gas delivered I would still say you're off the grid.  Most people can't be totally off the grid because if you have a wood stove you either have to have a huge amount of land and time to chop wood or else buy it.

You wouldn't want to build this type of house in a modern subdivision, your neighbors would hang you but in the right place it is beautiful. The walls were 2 foot thick and completely sound proof. There was some air infiltration so my heating bill was similar to other houses of comparable size.

"thanks for the  reply.  The incoming supply pressure is not relevant. Ive installed plenty off of very low pressure cisterns. If it doesn't have a vent then it is an unvented system. You are relying on your supply pipe to take up the expansion of water (cold to hot expands by at least 5% volume). That is fine and normal in a vented system . It is classed as one of your safety devices but you have to have a vent as well as this is your second safety device on a vented system.  You have an unvented system and you are relying on your supply pipe to take up the water expansion (the pressure vessel will do nothing at this low pressure) . I stand by my original diagnosis. Why not send a schematic to Heatra Sadia to clarify .i'm sure they will concur with me.
Moving forward with this  , if you have such a low incoming supply, I would install a small (125litre) storage tank on the first floor and have this fill your cylinder then you can run a vent pipe from the top of your cylinder  up to it thus turning your system into a vented type which is suitable for solid fuel (you may wat to check with Heatrae that this is Ok-ie no bafffles or stuff that wont allow you to do this).
I hope you dont think im nitpicking but stuff like this screams out at me (bit OCD) Any unvented hot storage vessel over 15litres (or maybe its 10) is rigorously covered by legislation in the UK.
