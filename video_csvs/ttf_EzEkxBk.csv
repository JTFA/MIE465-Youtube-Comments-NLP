"Even an experienced pilot can easily misjudge his altitude when flying like this - it only takes a fraction of a second of inattention to hit the water. Experienced pilots flying low try to compensate by carrying some nose-up trim, requiring some forward stick force to maintain the low altitude. The plane will start climbing by itself if the pilot is momentarily distracted.",-0.1779,67
"Folks, before you read any further comments, I'd like to clear up a couple of things:
1. The ""fuel"" that this plane uses is gasoline, not jet fuel. The engine is a Rotax 4 cylinder piston engine. And even though diluted in water, any fuel would be a serious irritant to the eyes, nose and mouth of anyone who chose to jump in the water to assist in the recovery.
2. Control malfunctions aside, it is very dangerous to perform abrupt maneuvers in an aircraft when close to the ground. Just look at how airplanes behave around airports. Slow and methodical, with the final approach being a straight, gradual downward trajectory with a careful flare and touchdown. Very boring to watch from the ground but it's the busiest, most intense time inside the cockpit. 
3. When over water (or snow or sand), it is very difficult to judge your height above the surface, as there are very few visual cues to help your judgement. And no, an altimeter doesn't help you during the last 20 feet or so, you have to ""eyeball it"" and that takes a fair amount of experience and skill.

Roy, rest in peace. My heart breaks for your wife and family.",0.8593,240

Roy Halladay Is Dead Find the Roy Halladay,-0.6486,8
"Roy Halladay Nov 7, 2017 Icon A5 crash. I hate to comment. All speculation. But maybe someone might learn something from what is said below that may help them not to crash in the future. The following may not be what happened. As said elsewhere, this particular plane Roy was flying has a flight data recorder so we thankfully will know what happened whether an engine failure or etc when he wasn't expecting it.  Speculation is that he may have been practicing to get his speed and configuration right to touch down on the water without actually touching down. He may have gotten too close to the water at a speed to fast and flipped. He may also at the same time had a down draft of air that caused him to touch water when he wasn't expecting it, with forward velocity too fast and that would have caused a flip over. Which would be like hitting concrete. That would most likely have caused death instantly. Speaking from experience picking up and hauling crashed aircraft and over 16,000 hours flight time as a pilot, aircraft mechanic and FAA authorized aircraft inspector picking up the damaged aircraft at the scene for repair or just securing the aircraft. Many new pilots of sleek aircraft are scared to slow down for landing for fear of stalling. Touching down too fast can cause porpoising in both water and on ground. I've picked up and repaired many aircraft that had porpoises like that causing landing gear failure. Or flip over in seaplanes. The cure for that for newer pilots, listen, is take the aircraft up to a higher altitude, put the aircraft in landing config, slow the aircraft down into slow flight at a high altitude to assist recovery, then carefully see just where you feel the wing begin to burble, lightly tremble, that is it begins to stall like you do in normal flight training. At that moment where the wing begins to burble, make a mark next to the airspeed indicator exactly where that wing, that static system, and that airspeed indicator shows a stall; at that weight and passenger count, as every aircraft even of the same model, indicates different on the airspeed indicator slightly.  If digital make note of the airspeed number and put that next to the airspeed indicator on ape at least. Then, as long as you are above that you'll be safe during flare, especially in ground effect or water surface effect where the stall might be lower than at a high altitude. At least you'll be fast enough not to stall, and slow enough not to porpoise or bounce. We can't see in the video if the landing gear was down. Landing gear inadvertently put down or forgotten down has caused many seaplane accidents and deaths that look just like this one. The flight data recorder box should show whether the gear was down. I'm surprised it had a FAR box. I had a good friend of my Father's and his son who were experienced. They landed a Piaagio Royal Gull in lake Okeechobee many years ago May 14, 1980 with the landing gear down inadvertently, which caused the same damage as this scene looks to be. Terrible for his family, he had nothing left in life that he had to do  other than just live a good life with his family. Above thoughts just opinion and trying to make sense of it as, there but for divine intervention go I... Losing a family member, in this case Father, as I lost mine as well, although they are gone, and the grief will never go away, we will always every day know in our own world what they would have thought, done, or said, so at least in that way, a small way, they can still be there in our lives...",-0.9195,708
Roy Halladay officially dies from drownding(NTSB). While people take pictures. They didn't do anything to help. Holy shit bro!,-0.2942,26
"Roy held both a multi and instrument ratings with around 800hrs. Its clear from the video he decided to do a joy ride in this airplane and bit off more than he could handle. He was perfectly legal to fly that low over water provided there were not boats below him, but he did not have experience with aggressive low level maneuvers. What he was doing was not 'practice' water landings. A landing is done by flying ¬†a square box pattern with descent on final as you touch down on the water. He was doing dives down to the deck and zoom-climbs back up, followed by near wing-over turns. I'm willing to bet money he stalled it in the turn, or did a zoom climb without sufficient energy (speed), to get high enough at the apex of the turn so that when he dove back down by the time he had airspeed to pull back up he smashed nose first into the water. Unfortunately, Roys father is an airline pilot and will probably question in his mind why his son was so reckless that day for the rest of his life. The airplane itself is one of the first - EVER - to pass the FAA stall/spin test standards. I strongly believe the aerodynamics are extremely sound., but the marketing of ICON makes it seem like you can just do ""anything you want"" to the A5 because it has an AoA indicator and spin safety. ""It's a like a car and a jet ski!"" ¬†It's an airplane, and it demands respect. Roy seemed genuinely excited to take ownership of his plane and to help out an aircraft company in the process. What a needless loss, I hope he did not have a passenger on board.",0.9272,328

The way I can see it mr. Holidays plane of the Toronto Blue Jays when it went down it looks like he tried to land on the water and it looks like a plane flipped upside down some more or less the current of water and the forces are great especially when you're under a lot of power going down into the water and when you're going underneath the tide or anything like that the water goes over the aircraft alone the aircraft the flip is what it looks like and looks like the engine on top of the aircraft ripped it apart piece by piece the wing looks like he's been ripped apart by the motor itself or I must have had a loose motor to begin with because the way it banked and went down was quite fast so it was looking to get an emergency landing probably the same thing that happened to the fellow who developed and made the aircraft same thing happened hard to tell when till the fa comes up with a proper Authority and proper analysis of the plane on how it was wrecked thank you God bless we'll miss that Jay for sure,0.9705,202

"Was he drinking while flying ? Some people have a death wish . Hard to say where he was mentally.  Doesn't really matter who it is it's a person. Sad thing is if it was just some regular person the world wouldn't have heard about it. The lesson should be what went wrong and how and how we can prevent it from happening again. Alot of great people died in plane crashes people Richie valens.  Otis redding, alliyah etc. Sad stories but what still messes up my head still to this day is where in the hell is Malaysia flight 370? I could have swore I heard on the news that day it went missing that a naval ship shot down a plane. Maybee I'm crazy. Maybee it is a cover up. Don't forget America shot down a civilian plane full of innocent people back in the day. But was it America?  Or an ally? Or an enemy?
