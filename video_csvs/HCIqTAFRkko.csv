"Dear friends Jesus Christ is ALWAYS WITH YOU! Upon accepting this truth, these 3 words will become like a safety net for you, protecting you from falling into despair. Because we are human, we will always have ups and downs in our life experiences. But the promise of the Presence of our Lord and Savior limits how far down we can go. Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down. Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. Dear ones, not only is Jesus with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory. All you have to do is say YES to Him this very moment and receive the promises of his unfathomable love. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9897,236
