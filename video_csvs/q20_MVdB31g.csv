"Great job and truly masterful animation. But unfortunetly it doesn't change the fact that this scene was terrible and fighting didn't make any sense... 

For example, why they were attacked simunatously only by two pretorians?

Why Rey is better duelist than Ben?
This move was just sooo bad...",0.3939,54

"K Qwer dude... making an 16 bit of anything is not theft. If i draw this scene into a flipbook is that theft? No. Stop it. Go troll somewhere else this channel is doing really cool things and totally legal or it would have long been flagged and so would anything else like it..
