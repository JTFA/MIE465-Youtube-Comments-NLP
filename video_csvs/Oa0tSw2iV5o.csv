"As a criminal Justice student I can say that the reason the 1994 assault weapons ban was never restarted is because there is no evidence that it did anything. Didn't increase or lower violent crime rates. Go look for yourself there are dozens and dozens of studies on the ban. The main reason is of crimes involving firearms only 3% use rifles and everything was grandfathered in. However if you completely ban semi auto rifles, like you hand them in and everything, that is exactly what hard-line pro gun people consider a tyrannical government. All its going to do is cause even more violence.

BTW, three to four cops didn't do a DAMN thing to stop this.  BUT, in the US, yearly,  272 people get killed by use of a rifle.  HOWEVER,  1584 people got killed by the use of knives.  Going to have knife control next??  626 people got killed by the use of hands and feet.  Going to have background checks at the maternity ward?  The idea is not to stop honest people from obtaining firearms.. It is to prevent people from killing other people by ANY means.  Start making these people pay for their crimes. Start protecting our children by prevention of these weapons and any weapons being taken into the schools.  Have trained professionals on staff and guarding our children. We have armed guards for actors and actresses, politicians and others. Why can't we have armed guards protecting our children??  Do you really think that by eliminating a firearm purchase will prevent a school shoting?  Do you really believe those same people will not make a bomb, (that you can get instructions to make from the internet) if they can't get a firearm?  MY GOD!  Can you imagine the devastation from a bomb??  Creating another firearm law is just another step to creating another firearm law.  There are already TONS of laws already on the books.

You're a Republic so you are not responsible for your votes? When you vote for someone it is okay because you're not the one doing the things yourself? Wow. Way to distance yourself for any and all responsibility. And did I say you are solely to blame? You seem to misunderstand that point several times. So let me make it clear that the kid who shot up the school is to blame. But so are the politicans who didn't make it harder for him to do in any meaningful way. Or the law enforcement those politicians set up. And you are most certainly to blame for not advocating change beyond just showing up to vote. Which seems to be the only thing you focus on. As if voting is the only way to encite any change. You want to hear solutions? 

A - a database with all gun owners and any relevant private information readily available (currently kept in hard-to-access spread out physical storage because of laws imposed by your precious NRA banning any kind of gun-ownership database). B - COMPREHENSIVE background checks. I don't care if it takes a year to get a gun permit every damn detail has to be reviewed. C - Laws giving police way more lenient access to permits when it comes to suspicious behavior regarding guns. D - A flat out ban on anything that isn't a hand-gun (because there are a lot fewer of those so it'll be much easier to control). E - Limit gun ownership to one per person over 18 (hand-gun). F - Severly limit domestic sale of guns with a hard cap in order to limit black market supply at a gradual pace. G - Bring the sale of all ammunations totally under control of the state. Any ammunition will have to be purchased off of the state. They can have it produced on contract and sell it as non-profit locally but they need to be able to make sure you can't just come in and buy a thousand rounds without them making sure who you are. This will put two potential bottle-necks on everything.

H - Increase funding for the FBI. They clearly seem to not have the capacity to take everything like this kid's disturbing social media posts seriously. Pull some of it from the military if neccessary. ISIS hardly warrants 600 billion a year in budget so some of that should go to other pressing matters.

You'll probably tell me all of this 'infringes' on your rights because you might need to overtake the government or something (a lot of you seem to have that weird consensus that the government you voted for is out to get you). Well the simple fact is that if the government wanted that they could do it just as easy with you being armed with rifles as with hand-guns because none of that will do anything to missiles, tanks, drones and bombs.

"Of course people won't give up rifles as things are currently. That's my whole damn point. And yes it is in fact much harder to commit mass murder with a hand-gun than an AR-15. You also seem to ignore that this was one of 8 different proposals. That were all supposed to happen at the same time. I know very well that hand guns do a lot of harm. But it is not realistic to remove hand guns exactly because there are so many more of them. If anything is to be done with regards to limiting the availability of hand-guns it must be gradual. That is in no way the case for assault rifles. And no. Hand guns do not function in the same way as an assault rifle. First of all hand guns are semi-automatic (of course the automatic or very high caliber variants would also be banned I think that doesn't need to be stated). They are a lot less accurate. They also have far smaller magazines. But as I said databases, very extensive background checks, FBI funding, cap on production of hand guns, ban on assault rifles, one gun per person. I'm spitting possible solutions. I'm not saying any of that can happen as things are with the NRA having pushed through a ban on even RESEARCH of gun violence as long as it involves using government money.

Which is exactly why those kids are at the very least motivated to learn from previous mistakes and do better than previous generations because none of this is good enough. It might take generations for something to even be done. But there are options. But they require is motivation to work. Of course it is easy for the NRA to say nothing works when all they do is sabotage anything that might work if people were motivated. You're not the only first world country with legal guns. But you're the only one  with this problem. And certainly far worse off in crime stats than countries without guns or those with proper regulations. And that is hard to change now.

"Watching with amusement as the NRA blast itself out of existence. For every school shooting they create new Democrats. A school of now 3000 some future Democrats along with approximately 6000 parents who if they were once Republican are now seriously reconsidering as their kids drop like flies for an organization that represents little more than 5 million members in a country of over 300 million. As several large companies race to disassociate themselves from the NRA, the Republicans will have to consider their options very carefully. Support the NRA for it's measly 2000.00 dollar donations or save themselves and prevent their constituents from flocking to the left! P.S. These kids that the gun supporters and and fanatics are helping kill, will one day soon be the next politicians. I would strongly recommend that the NRA come up with a plan B in order to save their soft pink little assess. It's quite clear that the argument that if more people were packing guns that it would make a difference. Three grown men were outside with guns and we're too scared to enter the building. Should the NRA start screening their members for courage??? Or would that be a threat to the second amendment?",0.9289,222

We need to get rid of assault weapons. We need properly trained deputy policemen who can response responsibly. We do not want teachers to be armed.We want schools to be gun free zones! So stop selling the idea of arming teachers.That would be a big mistake!  The sheriff of Broward County should not resign. He must have realized the shortcomings of his division and make all the necessary improvements.,-0.8118,75
"What Rubio said is right. Illegal guns are flowing in my area. Ww2 guns,Aks, ar10s, ar15s, subs, shotguns, you name it, my friends have it. Granade anyone? Ban all guns if you want, but I can guarantee they will still be flowing. Sorry",-0.09,57

“Why do we need you?” That’s exactly what libertarians have been saying forever. Limited government exists with the understanding that the government CAN’T and WON’T solve all problems and shouldn’t attempt to do so. Some problems cannot be solved via laws and law enforcement. Bad parenting isn’t going to stop because Marco Runio decreed it should.,-0.8982,73
