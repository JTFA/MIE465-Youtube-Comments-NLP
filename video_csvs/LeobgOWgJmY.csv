"Alexandre Demers 

We had a villain that the audience could sympathize with but not only that; you know you have a good villain when he not only challenges the heroes beliefs but also causes the hero to question and alter his own ways

You clearly didn't see the movie. Rarely does a villain accomplish this in supehero films lately. To say he was the same is foolish and demonstrates a lack of critical observation. But I'm 90% sure you didn't even see the movie. Plenty of people already admitted before the movie came out, that they would find ways to crap on it.",0.4436,111
"Alright.... devil's advocate trigger warning... I have a serious question to ask. And I ask this question as a person who is a strong supporter for diversity and the past film accomplishments of minority groups.

If Black Panther wasn't an MCU movie and wasn't a follow up to 20 films that have garnered a fan base...would it be as successful and anticipated?

I've seen so many videos that praise financial tracking for this movie and rejoice at the success of black cinema. Many directly attributing the success to this fact. However, is this an accomplishment for black film makers, or is it just standard MCU popularity?

Don't get me wrong, it is a milestone in the world of black superheroes and I am glad it's happened. But would Kevin Feige and Disney take a chance on it as a complete standalone? Are comic book fans excited to finally see a majority black superhero movie, or just excited to see another MCU movie?

The MCU fan base is loyal, and they will see ANYTHING you put in front of them if it is part of continuity. Again, if this wasn't building on the world of the MCU, would it be as popular???

The immediate answer might be ""Of course! People are craving more diversity in super hero films and this would be popular regardless!"". And yes, there is a portion of non-fans in the audience that will see it simply to support black cinema. But there have been plenty of great genre films with an all black cast in the last few years and most people didn't see them. Now, a big part of that is the studio. Many studios don't have faith in all black films and will give them a limited budget and release, and it creates little opportunity for people support it. So again, would Disney give Black Panther the chance it deserves if it wasn't related to MCU? If Ryan Coogler went to them with this idea would they fund the picture?

My honest answer is no, they wouldn't take the chance on Black Panther without the MCU. Disney and the MCU have had a lot of issues embracing diversity and it has been a long slow road (especially for Disney). At this point they have nothing to lose and will make bank regardless of what they attach to the MCU. This financial comfortably might be why white studio executives are making Black Panther. Not because they want to support diversity in film or see Black Panther come to life, but because they will make a $hitload of cash. 10 years ago Disney would have considered this too risky to produce. So what's changed in their eyes? The MCU is a powerhouse and will always make money.

It's a double edged sword that has happened throughout history. Sometimes the only way for black people to achieve equal opportunity is to find a compromise that pleases the white people in charge. I don't mean that in an offensive way. It's sad but true.

In the end, Black Panther is and will always be an important event for black cinema. But it's hard for me to believe Disney is doing this for anything but money and I believe 1000% that their locked in fan base is the driving factor behind success. I also think a lot of fans would skip this if it wasn't MCU. Let's be real, the trailer isn't anything special and honestly it's unclear what he does or what his powers are. From the trailer, it looks like a standard super hero flick (LOOKS! Not IS. Haven't seen it so I can't speak for the quality). 

Please don't take this argument as me discrediting Ryan, Chad and everyone else involved. This film is a big deal and there's never been anything like it. Not only a super hero film with a dominate black cast but they are also from Africa. It's not Will Smith as a drunken bum, Shaq as a poor garbage man who builds a suit or Damon Waynes also digging through trash. I just can't help but see MCU's pattern of success and hope that one day we can have diverse leads regardless of already existing properties, previous box office records and loyal fans. 

It's a sad fact that there were more black auteur film makers with national success in the 70's than there are today. In the 80's most of the mini studios were bought out by the majors and black cinema became almost non existent. In the 90's, studios made a few shitty super hero movies starring black people and for years used it as justification that audiences don't like black super hero films (never mind the equally shitty Roger Corman Marvel movies and many other failed projects). The studios have complete control over who makes movies, what they are about and what part of the world will see them. So I ask one more time... would Disney make Black Panther without 20 MCU films backing it up?",0.9985,930

Then you were never that interested in the first place. If someone made a comment in similar vein about Infinity War, would you SUDDENLY not want to see it?

Luckily meanwhile, the rest of the world is seeing this movie without prejudice. I just saw Black Panther again this morning. Blacks and whites were in attendance needless to say.

Can't say I'm not concerned with the ridiculous efforts to derail this movie though. I'm sure Marvel was prepared for this ridiculousness though

"Black Panther is going to be incredibly rewatchable! Firstly, it‚Äôs firmly within the ‚ÄúMarvel movie‚Äù structure and this is a good thing. Familiarity means we use less mental energy to process something and we humans tend to like things that are easy to think about. Another reason we rewatch movies is to recapture the good feelings we experienced on out first viewing. Most people are going to have extremely positive first experiences of Black Panther because of all the enthusiastic group events happening this weekend. So audiences will probably be inclined to rewatch it to recapture those amazing first feelings. They may also be inclined to bring family and friends in order to share the positive experience with people they like. A similar thing happened with Wonder Woman ‚Äì viewers returned to theatres a second time with their mothers and daughters to share the experience with them.

Black Panther also has long-term rewatchability. I predict audiences will rewatch Black Panther whenever things get bad in the real world, as a form of emotional regulation. This is why nostalgia appeals to audiences ‚Äì when horrible things happen in the world, we want to recapture the sense that the world used to be simple and good, so we rewatch something from our childhood. But with Black Panther, the (horrible but infuriatingly inevitable) events that may trigger the desire to rewatch could be incidents of racist violence. Movies always have the same ending, so they can‚Äôt disappoint us like the real, crappy world can. Additionally, Black Panther is taking on the status of a historical event. This is important because there are some movies we rewatch just to remind ourselves of how much time has passed and how much we have changed. Black Panther could become that cultural milestone for a lot of people. It may become a movie audiences revisit regularly to reflect on how we as individuals and as a society have changed ‚Äì whether for better or for ill.",0.4118,362

That is possibly my favorite SW scene of all time. There are lot of things I absolutely hated. Leia flying through space reminded me of the scene in Crystal Skull where Shia L was swinging with the monkeys. That‚Äôs how awful that was. Luke was a disappointment for me because I truly don‚Äôt believe Luke would ever even consider killing his nephew. I mean he had hope for Vader when he was clearly so far gone, yet Kylo had done nothing and he was going to assassinate him?  No, Luke wouldn‚Äôt do that. Also just the fact that we never truly see Luke at the height of his powers using his green lightsaber, which is my favorite saber. I thought the writing and pace were uneven. Some of the storylines felt preachy ( the war profiteering) and the casino planet didn‚Äôt need to exist. Rose and DJ simply should not have been in the film as they were completely unnecessary to the plot. The mutiny was just bad writing because she just had to tell them her plan to avoid all of that.

Rafael so you live in a city with a very diverse population, and race is an issue? Aren't people getting along just fine? Probably they are, because they don't care. Even if they don't that doesn't really change the point I'm making. Seriously, I haven't heard a single person here saying ""I'm going to watch black panther because it is so inclusive"" or because they feel represented. People care if a movie is good, world building like you said. Compelling characters, different stories.

I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things about it from friends, family and reviewers and was super excited to see it but was left disappointed. It added nothing to the MCU, the cgi felt cartoonish at best, it was predictable.. Rocky like even (or creed) To me. It felt like a wasted opportunity and could of been something bigger. 
 
One positive I will say about it was most of the cast had good performances but the script didn‚Äôt help anything.",0.9423,193

Being rather forceful pretending that it being black and the actors being BLACK and the writers being BLACK and the director being BLACK and the production designer being BLACK and the costume designer being BLACK has little to do with it and it just being ""great"" and being BLACK aren't side-by-side explicitly. 

I'm quite frankly tired of certain white folks I watch when talking about getting women or minorities behind the camera or projects that ""get the best person for the job"" or ""the reason Black Panther is great is because it's just GREAT not because it's black people telling a completely black story.""

People want representation. Those films also happen to be good (I haven't seen black panther yet) but you can't deny the link between success and representation (especially when Wonder Woman made a ton of money at the box office and justice league scraped together its budget). 

If you watch te reviews they judge it objectively and touch on representation. But when talking box office numbers you can't deny the link. Especially when youth groups and churches are buying out theatres",0.9569,120

This was a chance for pillars of the black community in Hollywood to come together and show the world that black actors, black history, black culture and black themes are not box-office poison. We don't need every movie to be so whitewashed, we just need more people telling the stories who actually have a connection to it.",0.9267,121

"True, but just because it works in games and television apparently doesn't mean it works on the big screen. D.C is the worst culprit at this point as far as not following their own formula. They absolutely dominate T.V in both the animated and even live action T.V series they've put out over the last 2 1/2 decades, but they're movies almost never reflect the diversity, nuance, and depth those shows have. D.C's t.v slate has churned out more LGBTQ+ and people of color superheroes than anyone else at this point, but they've only had 2, maybe 3 major motion picture releases within the last almost 40 years that fit those criteria. It's not that they don't have the live action working source material to use, they just don't choose to use it.",-0.5704,156

"Whoa, wait, hang on. I'm confused as to how you got to this conclusion. I have MANY thoughts on Black Panther. A lot of them (which will be in our spoiler review of the film) center on how much I loved how this movie explicitly DOES address black culture, how it uses societal issues to frame its story and inform its characters, and its powerful evocation of its deep African cultural roots. I also believe that it's wonderful that these characters stand on their own, alongside but also in addition to the cultural aspects of the film - they are well-drawn and well-acted, their motivations are sound, the actors inhabit them so beautifully. The cultural aspect of Black Panther is HUGE - and it pays off in huge dividends. Where did I say that I was completely ignoring the heritage the movie celebrates and the insight brought by the team behind it? Is it wrong for me to also point out that, along with what the movie says culturally, that it's also just a great damn movie? In the context of a discussion where I explicitly said I was curious to see the various different reasons why filmgoers would connect to this film? Without question, a large part of the reason this movie is doing well is that it's connecting to an underserved and underrepresented audience, particularly in genre films. I also think (and this is the point I was trying to make) that it also transcends that connection and makes many OTHER connections. I don't see why I can't celebrate both the movie's celebration of black culture AND the artistry behind its characters. Why do you assume that, because I'm referencing one aspect of the movie, that I don't have respect for others? - DM",0.9578,326

The closest time we could find where all the seats weren't completely sold out was 8 pm on Sunday. That's more than two days from when we bought the tickets. I've never had that experience with going to popular movies before. Even with Zootopia we could find better seats than that. So basically, the moral here is this movie is literally a reservation. If you want to get in you have to at least reserve 2 days in advance. XD",0.9363,118
You have made some good points here and I do agree that this movie wouldn‚Äôt have been made if they didn‚Äôt have the huge MCU fan base behind it to support it. The budget spent on this movie also wouldn‚Äôt have happened if 17 other movies in the franchise wouldn‚Äôt have preceded it. It‚Äôs sad but true. Hollywood is still a business and if these movie theaters think that movies with diverse casts won‚Äôt sell then they won‚Äôt take the risk,0.705,98
