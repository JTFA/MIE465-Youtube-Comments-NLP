Sean, I know this is a month old, but you really need to get rid of Da Bomb. That shit tastes like ass! I can enjoy a hot sauce that is all heat and no flavor (although it isn't my favorite style), but tDa Bomb has a flavor... it is the flavor of hot socks! Bring in some Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper sauce, or replace the Louisiana Hot Sauce with Tabasco Habanero. Both have the heat, but they also taste good.
Of course, this is just my opinion. I've tried Da Bomb, and it really tasted rancid.
