"Dear Sony, 

Stop trying to establish your bullshit Spider-Man character universe. You have made two insufferable and cringe-worthy garbage movies trying to establish  the universe of the so-called ""Amazing Spider-Man"", that caused you guys to give Spider-Man back to the smarter writers and directors of Marvel Studios , which enabled them to make a FAR SUPERIOR Spider-Man character in less than eight minutes of screen time in Captain America Civil War. You guys made the deal with them, and profited from Homecoming's box office sales. And yet still, you guys are trying to establish your own Spider-Man related films that are not connected to the MCU, and will undoubtedly ruin Venom, one of Spidey's most popular and iconic villains, for the SECOND F*CKING TIME. Just stop with this nonsense already!!!. When are you guys going to get this through your head?! The same thing goes with that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse movie which will most likely also bomb. ENOUGH is ENOUGH. Please scrap these phony ideas of yours and let Marvel handle the creative work from now on please! It's what we all want and deserve.",0.7295,212

"I feel Eddie Brock should always be ""Venom"". In fact, I'm not a fan of most tangents that Marvel has been doing with changing identity and ultimately brand of most famous characters/heroes in the comics. Marvel needs to be more original and come up with fresh new characters instead of rewriting existing brands/characters to push their political agenda. I'm not the only one that feels this way, It's reflected in sales that the core audience does not like this either. If you want diversity, then give the creative team a chance to come up with new interesting characters. Spawn is one of my favorite characters of all time, who just so happens to be African American. Marvel needs to take their time and come up with something original instead of rewriting characters/brands that have been around for 50 years...",0.9702,158

I might be in the minority when I say this but I am perfectly ok with Sony not doing the big reveal of Venom in the first trailer.  it is a teaser trailer people.  Now if he doesn't appear in the first official full trailer then ok you got me because I will be a little upset then but have confidence in this film.  I was talking with a friend of mine about this movie and I agree with him when he said it can't be worse then what we got in Spiderman 3.,0.9728,98
