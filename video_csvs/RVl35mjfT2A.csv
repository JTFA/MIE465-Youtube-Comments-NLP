Bill Belichick mad the right decision. He smoked weed before and wasn't right. Also he really wasn't that good this year. He got burned constantly almost to an annoying degree. However he should have played in the second half to change up the defense. It had become ineffective and predictable.

Secondly there was legitimate football justification for excluding malcom butler  from the starting lineup.  The eagles offense posed a serious challenge with the both height and physicality.  It was a presentation they had seen all her prior to the Superbowl.  

Now that being said. I will say it was selfish, cruel, and flat out immoral to lead a kay role player along for an entire week that his role had or will not change and then minutes before kickoff tell him he's benched.   lost all personal affinity for bellichick because of this.  I never thought he w's a good person but now I know he's not a good a good one.",0.775,145

If you knew you weren’t gonna let Malcolm play, why not let him know at the hotel, or on the team bus on the way to the stadium ? Why wait till he’s already suited up and on the field to tell him right before the national Godamn anthem ?? Literally at the last possible second ??? That’s low and that’s fowl.

I love it when an authority figure’s hard line bites him in the ass.,0.1531,17
I rarely agree with Stephen A but I admit he made perfect sense. Belichick thought he could win without Butler who played 98% of their defensive snaps past 3years. Wanted to hurt Butler for some unknown reason in his warp mind but ended up hurting the team. Their defense was a joke. It looked like they wanted to lose.,0.6799,65
I swear someone threatened Bill's life. This. Makes. No. Sense!,-0.69,15
I think Bill benched butler because he knows butler is going too want that big contract and if he didn't play in the super bowl or help them win it he could finnese butler on a contract,0.8646,37
I think Brady got in his head. I believe BB is tired of the all recognition TB12 gets for the Pats winning. He wanted to make a move ala Nick Saban.  Saban playing his 2nd string QB was legendary. I don't like Saban but that was a stud move.,0.0245,54

Me personally I think the game was rigged just from the fact all the money betted on the Eagles and it seemed point shaved.
