(Thriller/horror) Destination: A group of friends find themselves going somewhere that's not their destination. They thought they put the GPS at the right destination but it didn't seem like it, by the time they said ""You know what? I think the GPS is not taking us where we want to be"" but by the time they said that it was too late. They ran out of gas! The GPS was hacked by someone unknown. They start walking trying find shelter before dark but one by one they were killed until there were only 2 people left (let's name them Terra and June) Terra told June to go hide while she would send the killer somewhere else, the killer did catch Terra and she died. Unfortunately for June she found herself at a cliff and the killer caught up with her. The killer came closer and closer and then took their mask off. It was the main character who died in the middle. ""Why I did this you ask? Because when I was little you guys bullied me and when the day came where my mother only had one day left to live, you guys locked me inside the janitors closet. I never got to say good bye. I wanted revenge so I changed my appearance and got you all to trust me"" she said crying. She pushed June off the cliff and said ""I've finished my mission"" She said.
