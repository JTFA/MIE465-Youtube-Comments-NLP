"Because he just laid a big hit on a rival team player,  has happened countless times over the years, it's adrenaline. It wasn't a cheap shot, he was directly in front of Burfict, Burfict was going to hit Bell, Juju blocked him. Had Juju let him go, Burfict would have tried to do the same to Bell. Burfict not paying attention doesn't make it a cheap shot, he didn't lead with his helmet, and in fact turned his head away from the hit, couldn't ask a player to do more. When he lined the hit up, it was going to be textbook perfect, but Burfict moved up field, changing where the hit landed just enough for Juju to accidentally clip him on the chin.  When you break down everything about the play, it's not a cheap shot. Illegal? Absolutely, he made just enough contact with the helmet. Dirty? No, good block that landed wrong.",-0.7561,179

But, this isn't anything that hasn't happened hundreds of other times throughout the years. The NFL is being crapped on from all sides because of the disrespect some players have shown our country, and it is WELL DESERVED. Having said that, let's not lose perspective that this is a brutal sport, and this was just another brutal division game. They are all like that in the AFC North.",-0.8131,100
