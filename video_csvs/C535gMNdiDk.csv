In fact, rat enthusiasts are concerned for the welfare of the animal: Rats clean themselves by licking, so pouring soap on a rat isn’t good for them. The animal doesn’t appear to be being rinsed off, either, just soaped-up. This kind of washing is unnatural for it. Rather it’s unsafe and potentially inhumane.",0.8074,101
