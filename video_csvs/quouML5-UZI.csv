I think it was about time we saw the network side of iJustine‚Äôs tech/house.

She would say something like ""I am hungry. Should I go to mcdonalds  or burger king?"" then people would vote with money. 
Like on twitch or other Similar services. I am not a Apple person so most of her content just goes over my head. Her super dorky apple fandom is sometimes very funny.
