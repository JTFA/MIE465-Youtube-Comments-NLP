"Hey, I am have been in foster care since I was three months old and I hate my life most of the time, my real dad was very violent not just against my mum but also my half brothers mums he went to jail a numerous amount of times and I like never see him anymore and it's hard I haven't seen to of my half brothers for like 5 and a half years now, I have ADHD, ODD, CD and an intellectual delay and life is so so hard. I have held a knife to my chest like three times and self harmed, but I have got 3 teachers at school the 2 females are like mother figures to me and the male is like a father figure I am now 13, and I am thinking of moving out of the foster I have been in since I was three months old cause i'm not happy there and my friends and school are helping me do that but I wish more teachers\people would understand what I am going through and if I need to go and see one of the other teachers in class that I need to do that or if I am pissed off leave me along unless I want to talk to them.  I feel like the only time I can cry is when I go home and go to my room or shower, cause I feel ashamed if I cry in front of people I keep it all bottled up most of the time and now I just can't be strong anymore some nights I even cry my self to sleep. 
So if you are going through something like this then let me know and we can talk about it, just try and hold on I know just how difficult it is but honestly there are people out there who love you for you you just have to find them!!!!!",-0.6012,342

"My family foster, this breaks my heart. At 18 any kids haven't the skills to go out on their own let alone a foster child who's got their own baggage to drag along with themselves. Our 2 foster kids (18 & 25) are still part of our family and always will be. Fair play to the script for highlighting what these vulnerable young adults need, love, understanding and people who care.",0.8074,80

"Sorry I'm not trying to troll, and I like this song.. which is why I was repeating the song.. but then ok, at 3:02, where the subtitle wrote ""only to find they have to eat, sleep & study"", I can't help but notice that some family had a sofa and a flatscreen tv and the last family had a water dispenser in the back and a whole lot of shoes..

Surely you could get a 2nd had mattress from somewhere for cheap, even free... instead letting your kid sleeping on the floor

And the 2nd family where they let the kids eat on the floor, if you pause at 3:03, you could see there is a chair behind it :/
