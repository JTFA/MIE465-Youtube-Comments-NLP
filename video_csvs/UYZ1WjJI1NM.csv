"Dear Friends, did you know that Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man without ceasing to be God? Having been conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful man. He accomplished this by voluntarily giving Himself as a sinless sacrifice on the cross, thereby satisfying God's righteous judgment against sin. After the accomplishment of that redemption and justification by His bodily resurrection from the grave, He ascended to the right hand of His Father, where He intercedes on behalf of those who trust Him. Give your life to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ today. It will be the greatest decision you will ever make. ❤️❤️❤️      (Luke 1:34-35; John 1:1, 2, 14, 18; Romans 3:24-26; Romans 8:3).",0.9633,162
