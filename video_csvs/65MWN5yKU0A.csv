"+gtq838 I get what you're saying but how exactly is he encouraging? Most kf not all people should know that just because it's something he does, that doesn't mean they have to replicate step by step.   he's not training professional chefs. he's on youtube - that's correct. But many should keep that in mind that he IS a chef whom cooks his own way and shouldn't have to pad himself up because of a safety concern.
