"Mr president. I hope u listen to the real Media and Public comment. My advise to you is:  1. Read about past presidents. Study them.  2. Study how the W/H functions- protocols, norms, Policies and Procedures.  3. Stop blaming others. Admit mistakes, respect your predecessors, gov officials, cabinet members ..etc 4. The Presidency is the highest Office in the world with a big power attached. Don‚Äôt be petty that would belittle the Office and yourself. Earn respect because you can never ever command respect. 5. Don‚Äôt crave for recognition you can earn it if you have a good mastery of the function of the president. To master the job, Read, Read and Read! Ask others and learn, learn and learn!  6. Spend you time wisely among others Read and update your self. Don‚Äôt be impulsive and unglued. Listen a lot and talk only when important. Don‚Äôt make decisions with raw emotions.  Above all don‚Äôt forget your job now is not a reality job. It is a real job.  7. Always be honest and prompt the culture of truth and honesty. No lies even white lies allowed.  8. Never allow members of your family to be involved in gov related official functions. This will inevitably creates actual or potential nepotism,  and a serious corruptions.",0.9059,267
