"Because aliens with advanced technology would obviously have faster moving giant monsters to fight for them. A slow assed, giant machine would get raped. That was one of the things that made the fist movie unbelievable¬† Giant alien monster that moved as slow as hell.",-0.875,49
Best video,0.6369,2
"Bob Reno sorry, forgot to address the other part of your question, well the aliens were sending giant monsters, they were huge armored beast far larger than anything else on the planet. They had no need to be fast, and it was far from fair. But when humans started to fight with Jagers they could've sent something much more advanced, I believe after Charlie Day melded with a Kaiju he said something to the effect of that the Kaiju weren't even the main invasion force, they were advance units made to cause havoc and destroy cities. The movie actually ended before the aliens sent anything to kill the populous.",-0.8809,119
"Bob Reno well I'm glad you like the new one, but I don't, the appeal of the original for me is that it wasn't like Transformers where you have Kung fu robots running around. Creatures the size of skyscrapers have a tremendous amount of mass and that does not move fast. Del Toro showed a balance of accuracy and entertainment (by speeding them enough). As I said, edit out the buildings to remove scale and this would look more like guys in space armor fighting aliens than battle between giants. 

FYI, do you want to know why it's set at daytime? It's to help the Jagers colors stick out so you can tell them apart, because they lack originality of the different Jagers in the original. If you look at the new ones it's the same frame with different armor. Say what you want about Cherno Alpha, hate it or love it you could not mistake for any other Jager. As for the new ones, there was more that a few times in the trailers I lost track and couldn't tell which Jager was which.",0.8848,203

You can if you have a great storyline, but I think too many of the younger movie goers expect bigger, louder, faster and more for a sequel that if it isn't...its given the thumbs down. The director & producer have said they are going for a younger audience with this one for the bigger box office, so expect to be disappointed if you were an older fan of the original. We also have a fem empowerment aspect for the kids with one of the jaeger pilots being a teenage girl who is supposed to be a shithot hacker and built her own jaeger.",0.4215,140

"I loved Pacific Rim. This 'sequel' one looks completely different, I feel like it won't live up to my expectations.

It breaks the immersion of a giant fight. Just take out all the buildings and all you see are robots fighting aliens not some grand battle against giant beasts. 

And you also have the studio thing of let's have pre teen pilots to appeal to kids. And let's have more of everything (Jagers and Kaiju) so we can milk the toy market.
