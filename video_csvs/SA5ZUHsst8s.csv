"Straight Evil to abandon a dog.  There is no reason for this evil act.   My jack was thrown out on a busy highway during rush hour.  Daisy was saved at 6 wks when a man in a truck dumped them in the snow.  Not all puppies survived.  
14 & 15 yrs they Blessed us.  Both R.I.P Jack and Daisy Mae.
  I adopted another tossed dog from KY.
She is a doll, sweet as can be.  
Fostered for 7 months, ( people always passed by her. )
The Rescue  brought her to my farm.   I  instantly said yes.
I looked outside after the Foster Mom left.  Here on the driveway was two interlocking hearts imprinted.  
 I just put Daisy to sleep 5 days before.   
My heart ached to love another so soon.  
Listening to the spirit inside me, I received there Blessing.
Lazarus in the Bible  his sores were healed by a dog .

You talk about facts and info, but you never present it. I can show video's of cruelty shot with my own camera. I've been there on many rescues /
hoarding/and out an out cruelty to animals and forgive all to humans. I mean in Africa I shot a picture of a preserve worker sitting by the body oldest white rhino, killed by a poacher.  
I'am not talking about here say, I'am saying I shot the picture with my camera and with my own two eye's. It wasn't faked, esp. when you touch the animal, have the blood of the animals on your on two hands. Sad but to these occurs in domestic animals as well as humans. I have pictures I of the LV  massacre, the 2 in London.  Goes as far a back as the moon walk. I don,t know your ages or education levels, I don't care if you make statments like you have.  Prove it, where is your proof. If you want mine tell me where to sand the negatives. Last thing I belong to an extreme rescue organization group. There last case for 2017 involved the of a blind, pregnant dog who had her front legs delibrately broken, and thrown on a mountain side to die a slow death, all her 8 of her pups were dead inside her.
