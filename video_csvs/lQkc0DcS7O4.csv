"Dear brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ loves you so much. He desires to have a close and personal relationship with you. Will you accept Him and give your life to Him this very moment? In closeness with Jesus you are safe. In the intimacy of His presence you are energized. No matter where you are in the world, you know you belong when you sense Jesus Christ is near. Ever since the Fall, man has experienced a gaping emptiness that only Jesus presence can fill. You were designed for close communication with our Creator Father God. Father God enjoyed walking in the garden with Adam and Eve, before the evil  one deceived them!                                                                                                                          When you commute with Jesus in the garden of your heart, both you and Jesus are blessed. This is His way of living in the world---through you! Together we all can push back the darkness, with Jesus Christ whom dwells with us for He is the light of the world. Believe in Jesus Christ, accept what He did on the cross for the sins of mankind. Ask our Lord and Savior to forgive you of your sins, study The Living Word in the Christian based Holy Bible. Allow yourself to be water baptized, washed clean and made anew by His precious blood. Welcome the Holy Spirit into your whole being. It will be the greatest decision you will ever make.❤️❤️❤️ (Psalm 32:7;  Genesis 3:8-9; John 3:16; John 8:12)",0.979,280

"Exploodess out of Allen's hand! Reminds me of Vick  looks effortless but they're fastballs! I think Allen is best QB in the draft. The problem is the Browns will need to address their backfield, not a fan but Crowell and Duke won't cut it and it'll be rough for him as a rookie QB.  Surprised there aren't rumblings of Elway wanting to move up for him!",0.8102,72

"I’m going to say it: Mayfield won’t be a good pro. I like all the QBs this year, but his OC and OL put him in a position to succeed. You look at his tape and he’s often got nearly 3+ seconds in the pocket before throws, and then when he does, it’s to a wide open guy. He won’t get that in the NFL. I think his pro experience will look like his senior bowl performance.",0.882,97
"I’ve heard a lot about these two guys (amongst many, granted) and it’s good to see video of them. Allen has one hell of an arm (good 40 yard run too), but Mayfield looks smooth, with better accuracy. It’s going to be interesting to see how they cope in the NFL when the defence is coming right at them. I look forward to seeing these guys play.",0.882,84

Nick Carlisle go back and watch that game. Obviously he had the turnovers but he made impressive throw after impressive throw in that game. And OSU’s front 7 pancaked USC o line. He also had a receiver fumble a ball and a kicker miss a FG. Definitely not his best performance but i think his fumbling can be fixed.
