Here’s a question I have ( I guess anyone can answer) but:
1. When you do the foundation is it true that I should match my neck versus the actual face (I have yellow/olive green on the neck area but since I live in Michigan I have more of a red undertone now?
2. When people do cut crease do you use the lightest shade on the eye lid or do you use your true complexion?",0.9654,152

"Hey Jackie, I have been a sub of yours for awhile and I missed the snapchat you did about the IT cosmetics sale to Loreal and the owners statements at that conference. Just wanted to tell you that you’re awesome and you did a great job of highlighting the irony in her statements. It’s crazy that skin color has the most immediate effect on what foundation someone chooses, but these companies are so limited in that respect. Hopefully something changes because of people like you who are willing to speak up for change in the beauty community.",0.9486,107
