"""anti-war""
 Lol

  Uh, ...and which war would you happen to be ""anti""?

   It was a war on the train that day.
The war would be on if a murderous intruder broke into your home intent upon slaughtering your family/""loved ones"" and you sought to defend them and yourself against the assailant/opposition.

"Don't worry... there are plenty of such incidents in which survivors/ heroes don't write a book and or get to make a movie with someone like Clint Eastwood but exactly that fact means you'll never hear of them unless some director knows about it. 

It somehow seems kinda wrong though that those that seize the opportunity.. and why not, it's a chance of a lifetime after facing death... are now having to be questioned about their motives. I guess neither of you guys were on the train so I don't see what gives you the illusion that you have the right to judge what they are doing. It is not a requirement to put your personal opinion about everything you see. Sometimes it's better to just shut the hell up.

"No, I don't know them since I'm not an American and I weren't on train either. But I've looked this thing up.There were plenty of other people involved in stopping him. But these three managed to do it for good, since two of them were in military, therefore had been through training for such scenarios. Hint, why they are so well together after the events. Plus they got lucky overall because terrorist's gun jammed. And it's not like they were in Hollywood right away.They wrote a book (which also is done by a lot of people who have been through something unrealistic) and Eastwood decided he wants a movie. And they weren't cast right away either. 
They are on talk shows because people want to see them. And why can't they turn life around and get into showbiz if they get offered ?

These guys have no acting training, and Eastwood made them look terrible by letting them perform by just rolling the camera. 
Even though they are playing themselves, they were playing themselves at a specific point in their lives. That doesn't mean they are going to be able to convey the fear and uncertainty they felt at that time, without some training.
