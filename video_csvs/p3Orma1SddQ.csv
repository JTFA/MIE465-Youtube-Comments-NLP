"Jesus Christ loves you so much please your life to Him today! Do you know the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is the Divine Person who convicts the world of sin (righteousness and judgment).

He indwells them permanently, seals them unto the day of final redemption, bestows spiritual gifts upon them, and fills those who are yielding to Him. Every believer is called to live in the power of the Holy Spirit so that he will not fulfill the lust of the flesh but will bear fruit to the glory of God. ❤️❤️❤️    (John 3:3-8; 14:16-17; 16:7-11; 1 Corinthians 12:7-11, 13; Ephesians 4:30; 5:18)",0.8729,160
