"""GrubHub"", ""Seamless"" and all other companies of that sort should put the ""I do Not need the napkins and plasticware"" more obvious and the tick box ticked by default.

This way, for sure, who really needs it would be un-ticking the box.

In case people would be complaining too much, the not so good alternative is to let users customise the default value for this tick box in their user's account/profile preferences page.

"I love this video, and the interview with Lauren Singer that follows, so much. It's hugely important and inspires me to try to do more. But I have a few questions I'd love to ask, if I may (and pls forgive me if the question is more related to the other video; I watched them in a row and they're blending together in my head):

1. I live in CA and really appreciate that stores are selling plastic bags now instead of just giving them away. But I always reused those plastic bags for small garbage cans, and for cleaning out the litter box. What can we use instead, especially for the latter? 

2. We definitely have dinner out frequently, and I hate all the packaging that comes with it. We also recently signed up for one of those meal delivery programs, which are really nice, but again, I hate all the packaging, and don't really feel like I can recycle it all (I'm not sure how much my housing complex really recycles anyway, but that's another issue). What can we do about that? I feel like at certain places if I try to bring my own cup, for example, they refuse to fill it, claiming  that it's a health risk. Any pointers? 

3. Speaking of cups, I know it's terrible, but I definitely prefer those little one-use drinking cups when I brush my teeth (especially if I'm sick). I guess the obvious answer is 'use a reusable one instead,' but as I said, I prefer these one-use ones. Is there a special brand that's somehow easier on the environment or something? 

Thank you so much for considering these questions (if anyone answers). I will definitely check out Lauren's pages too, and I'll probably ask her these same questions. :)   Keep up with the awesome videos!",0.9678,355

"Why aren't water bottle refilling stations everywhere? The number one reason I buy bottled water is because I'm out and about and my main water bottle is empty. Heck, even if I had to pay 20p to refill my bottle, that's still cheaper than bottled water

"You might think that with all the recent below zero days that climate change is responsible.  Turns out the biggest cold snap across America lasted 2 weeks in 1899 and broke records in a record number of states.  Look it up.  Guess we have not done too much damage in the last 118 years.  Our current weather has nothing to do with climate change, but the nightly news makes us think it does.  Also, I was watching Nova...300 years ago there were hurricanes worse than the ones we have had in the past 50 years and this was a time of global cooling.  Scientist had a hard time explaining this since it does not fit the current belief of warm water, from a warm planet makes for bigger storms.  Turns out, other forces were believed to be at work.  Ie) volcanic.  Since the earth has gone through many periods of warming and cooling in the last 66 billion years or so...and knowbody knows why.  How do you know that this 1.3 degee increase in the last 100 years is caused by man?  You dont...it can be naturally occurring again as it has before.  And finally, man has been on the planet only 300,000 years.  With man, there will have to some consequences to our existence..pollution.  Instead of over regulating our business and choke our economy...wouldn't it be better if we insist that China and all the other noncaring countries clean up their act.    Americans are being chumps while the rest of the world gets away with murder.",-0.9316,290

"love this. i would really love if grocery stores would allow you to refill drinks of your choice at cost. for example, i love hint water but the company does not sell them in larger containers. what if these companies sell the water in reusable jugs with their packaging. when you are done, you can come back with the empty container and refill them. this also would apply to other beverages we buy. not only would it reduce waste on our end, but reduce waste with companies",-0.3291,96

"ok this video is very confused if you want to reduce energy used in creating products then you dont want recycling. recycling uses twice the power and twice the pollution. its far safer to just throw trash in a landfill than to use the energy recycling. we dont have a landfill problem as to space and the only dangerous gases coming from landfills are the methanes from rotted food, not exaclty a recyclable. 

as to packaging is a legal issue. your burger needs its own wrap because if its next to a fish sandwhich and your allergic to  fish well thats a lawsuit. if you dont get a bag (presumably as a carry out order or drivethru) your food gets cold. if you have  ketchup dispenser your food is mushy by the time you eat it. people care far more about convience than pollution so yes we want it even if you say the words we dont your actions prove otherwise",0.9194,172

"so at my workplace, some people get packaged food. I am one of them. and since i care about nature. I calculated if roughly 1000 employees (2 shifts) buy a plastic bag to carry the product everyday we are using 2000 plastic bags in one single day. Multiplied by 20 working days its 40,000 plastic bag in a month. Multiply that to each company, every employee, every country....
Anyways what small change i did was to say no to plastic bags to carry stuff i buy, then no plastic cutlery from 7-11 shop",-0.0516,105
