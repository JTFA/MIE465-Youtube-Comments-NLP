Jesus Christ, that must've been scary as hell. 

I imagine it must be like trying to patrol the entirety of the US Southern border with only a couple hundred under-funded, under-trained agents, and the people you're looking out for are thousands of cartel members with years of experience in wars and gangs, billions of dollars in provisions, no sanctity for peace and order, and on top of that, some of your own men are being bribed by the very cartel members you're trying to take down.

Also, a minor detail, I am not sure it is right to pronounce ""Cheng I"" as ""Cheng the first"".
While it is easy to confuse the ""I"" as a title like ""Edward the first"", ""I"" is actually his first name, and ""Cheng"" being his last name.

However, Europe didn't try to conquer India, inner Africa, and mainland Asia due to the fact that they didn't have the capability to transport their massive ship-of-the-lines up river. With the Industrial Revolution, the British and eventually the French along with a few other Europeans developed steam-powered ships which can easily navigate up river.

"Portugal also arrived first to Japan and Nagasaki was under Portuguese administration at that time. Japan and Portugal share a lot of history, for example, Tempura is a Portuguese dish and not Japanese. The Portuguese word was Têmpora and it was brought to Japan by Portuguese merchants. 
Back to the topic, the only reason the Dutch even ended up being the only ones trading with Japan, later on, was because Japan got scared by the idea of a future Portuguese rule/influence. Portugal had already converted 200.000 Japanese to Christianity in a very small amount of time and it was traditional for the Iberians (Portugal/Spain) to use religion to control other nations.
It even sparked an incident called the Shimabara Rebellion where thousands of Japanese Christians rebelled against the Shogunate. But Tokugawa won and Christianity in Japan was driven underground until ""recently"".",0.128,161
