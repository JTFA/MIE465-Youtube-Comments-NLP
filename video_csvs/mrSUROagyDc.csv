"Call me pessimistic, but there’s NO possible way this could have been an “accident”. I 100% believe this was done deliberately.

How do you “accidentally” send out a nuclear attack warning? How did at least 5 people not lose their jobs over this?

Alerting of a nuclear attack is an immensely serious threat which takes a considerable amount of careful, deliberate action to be able to do, or at least it should. You can’t just trip over your shoe lace, fall and brush up against the button. Think about how many times your phone or computer will ask you, “yo are you SURE?!” when you try to do a factory reset. So to say somebody pushed a ballistic missile warning button on accident? Horse shit.

Whoever did this had a clear agenda, what that might be, I have no idea.

it was not a test. The governor even apologized saying that apparently some idiot in a ""shift change"". Someone accidentally pressed the button. And no it wasn't communicated to the public well. I got the text and then it broadcasted on the radio and tvs. Which scared everyone! Obviously.. it took 45 minutes for them to communicate to the public that this was a false alarm. Meanwhile while this was happening we were notified the missile fell into the water and so ppl were terrified! It should not take 45 minutes to be notified ... ppl are still shook here.",-0.9052,124
