"""Quite the lamest thing you could do."" Not being in the apple ecosystem opens the doors to basically everything else. Fine. I'll compare it to the others. Windows is the mainstream OS that is the best there is, even though Linux and Ubuntu do hold a marketshare.  For the majority of nearly everyone, what does Win10 do significantly worse than any other OS? You pointing out nothing other than my ""quite the lamest"" argument is possibly the dumbest thing you could've done. The main commenter is complaining about the OS when its totally possible to just wipe it and put whatever OS he wants on it besides macOSx. There is absolutely no standing to justify that Win10 ""is shit"" compared to anything on the market right now. So why dont you work on your grammar and leave the tech to the big boys.",-0.9414,163

Here is what bothers me about this gorgeous Dell laptop.. no touchscreen as standard base.. all touch panel options will be forced as high resolution options plus further premiumizations.. battery life claims are based on lowest end models.. 20 hours is likely base base base package and likely ideling.. if you opt for 1440P or 4K display and touchscreen and anything extra.. expect closer to 12 hours ideling and much larger drop in usage pushing those extra pixels and shit.. on top of that dell will send all reviewers incorrect material to read off to us, like 20hours of battery and speeds of 9999999x this and that.. but send them premium but stripped slightly model.. so expect reviewers to give very very high praise and love it buy expect nothing like that when you buy it. 

Also dell will likely never opt for Ryzen Apu inside of one of these even though same 15 watts as Intel part and GPU power will be 4x igpu of Intel parts and could will be comparable as well.. I'm guessing that is because Intel is still in Dell's back pockets paying them ..",0.9376,256

"Wait a minute... Aren't you just saying if you didn't have a use for a computer you wouldn't buy a computer? Isn't that a little redundant?

I wouldn't buy a PC if I didn't play games on it, edit videos on it, write up documents on it - but I do, so I need one. You're kind of just saying if you didn't have a use for something you wouldn't buy said something? I'd say that use alone surely justifies its existence, even if you hypothetically didn't have need of said use - 'hypothetically' because you *do* have need of said use.",0.3339,116

"i called dell to try to get around the issue or get directed to 1080P touch models, i heard they exist but i couldn't find any!   they told me only way to buy touch screen was to order it with 1440P display or 4K display.. was a guy who i got transferred to i dont remember what he did at dell but sounded american he said yes a 1080P+touch sku exists, however because it isnt dell selling or marketing it he couldnt tell me anymore info on it..  

i believe after further research 1080P touch models existed in 2 forms.. 1 was CES models/display models.  and 1 limited run of microsoft store model with signature edition of windows 10.  they are exceptionally rare!!!!

i was part shopping ebay for 13 inch 1080P touch display replacement, and no luck. i emailed several large scale part sellers they told me doesn't exist and one said contacted OEM supplier for details,  but nothing came of that..",0.6776,182

"iaytoao Very true, but you expect a Porsche or other high class automobile to offer a significant advantage in terms of performance or craftsmanship over a Honda, so therefore the cost is somewhat justified.

"john lee Agreed, looks like we are the only sane ones here. Regardless of whether or not we are rich or poor, it simply ISNT logical to spend $1500 on a laptop that will dramatically loose its value in a year, has no real graphics capability, has an average performing CPU relative to desktops, and has a battery that will only last so many cycles. I'd be happy to spend $600 on this laptop for a base model, since it does have a nice design and all. The only reason we pay high prices and premiums for our electronics is because we allow them to charge us this much!",0.5815,121
