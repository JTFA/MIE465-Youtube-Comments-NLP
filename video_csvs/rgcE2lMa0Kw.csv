"""That time period is shown because its when this warming is occurring.""

this is the problem. its shown whats happening in a small picture. but not shown what happening AGAIN in a bigger picture. it happens before a lot of times, before human race too. periodically, like a pattern.

""you seem to be implying that science only looks at one small section and ignores the context of the rest""

why are you try put words in my mouth and why are you talk about science like a person or an entity?

if you see a smaller picture in this topic you are easily mislead yourself like the global warming deniers. taths all. 

""Why mention past warming when that has nothing to do with the current warming and its causes?""

because it's not true. see: the debate is not about the global warming. thats a fact. the debate is about it's natural or human cause. if it's human cause: how many percent caused by humans? it can't be 100%, because of the interglacial and solar minimum-maximum patterns.

"1) I'm sorry but the NOAA link you provided does not support what you're saying. In fact it shows graphs of the continued rise in average temperatures and loss of snow cover up to 2017. Perhaps you cited the wrong link?

 2) What was initially thought to be a hiatus or pause in warming between 1992 and 2012 turned out to be an error in how ship-based measurements were traditionally taken:
  http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469.full
  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-pause-in-ocean-warming/
  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170104143554.htm 
 Ironically, that error was caused by similar local heat source effects you are talking about.

 3) Even if that error had not occurred,  a short 14 year snippet to gauge temperature trends for the last 130 years is cherry picking.

 4) The point you seem to be making is that scientists either don't know to take those factors into account when calculating temperature trends or they do know and are deliberately lying about it. Which are you saying?",-0.9773,166
"1) No, its not a problem. Again, the time period being shown is the time period we have been increasingly affecting the chemistry of the atmosphere. These factors *were not present* in past climate shifts.

 2) I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. I'm trying to understand what you're saying. Hence the use of questions and phrases like ""you seem to be implying""  and ""you think...?"".

 3) There's no intentional misleading happening here. When we're discussing the last 130 years of anthropogenic warming we show that time period. As I said before, there are plenty of scientific studies/graphs showing longer time periods....but those longer periods are not what's being discussed here.

  4) So you *are* suggesting that the sun and interglacial cycles are responsible rather than human sources. As I initially asked, do you think scientists aren't smart enough to take other possible factors like that into consideration before declaring a cause?

"How do I even start to unpack you scientific illiteracy?   Here is the explanation:  1. The GISS temperatures are surface temperatures measured for many years with ordinary thermometers, on land or on ships, and then corrected in the NASA offices for various things like variation in weather station density.  No satellites are involved for the data (called ""GISSTemp"") shown here.  2. Setting aside that humans have been communicating over long distances for thousands of years (through this thing called a ""letter"" using this thing called ""mail"".  What communication is even needed to record a temperature???  A person reads a thermometer and writes down the temperature, time, and date and station location in a log book, or latitude and longitude if on a ship.  (Yes, sailors could actually locate themselves at sea long, long before the GPS - they use this thing called a sextant (in the days of Columbus, an ""astrolabe""), along with a clock, and astronomical tables).    3. The log books were then carried to, and stored away in various locations, typically universities or libraries - both have been around for even longer than thermometers have.    4. Researchers at NASA or their equivalents at NOAA, or the Hadley and Copernicus Climate Centers in Europe, then go to the data storage sites - or contact the curator or librarian of them and have them sent.  They then crunch the numbers.  Each agency uses a slightly different method to correct their readings for station density, possible urban heat islands and the like, so the temperatures they report vary by a small, unimportant amount.    5. There are temperature records going back much further than 1880, but before that time, there were too many big ""holes"" in the data due to unpopulated and unexplored areas.  But with extensive exploration starting in the late 19th century, these holes were filled in enough to reliably calculate global and regional average temperatures.  This is why the temperatures shown here start at the year 1880.",0.3839,387

  2) What 'proof' do you want? What would convince you? If the overwhelming consensus of scientists (experts in the relevant fields) and their data doesn't convince you then could anything?

  3) No one here has even come close to suggesting ""believe everything they read and never question"". Nice attempt at a straw man there.
   Skepticism is great. In fact its *required* as a necessary part of science. The problem comes when those with *less or no* education/research experience in a given field claim to know more about that subject than the experts in that field. Would you trust your local barber to know more about how the human brain works or a neural scientist? Same with climate science (and any science). 
  Until you have an equivalent level of expertise on a subject then you have no credible basis upon which to claim the experts don't know what they are talking about.

 If we are headed into a grand solar minimum, then our observations will be tested this next solar cycle.  When the scientists claimed that the rise in temperature causes ""horrible"" hurricanes, they failed to observe the face of the Sun.  2005 was a very active year of solar activity and it is no coincidence that that same year we had a very active hurricane season.  If you pair up the dates of hurricanes and the dates of solar activity you will find a distinct correlation and perhaps conclude that the Sun is the cause of those weather events.  2017, look at the dates of the hurricanes and match it up with the dates of Solar activity.  The sun was not active for a good part of the 2017 hurricane season.  Then once the sun became active, the tropics became active. Fact.

 Also fact the strongest hurricanes were most directly affected by the sun, due to the observable activity of the storm.  The strongest hurricanes were fueled by electrical currents of solar activity.  Just so you know, it is an observed fact that the solar activity fuels most of lightning that happens on Earth.  Now to the point, electricity makes things spin/rotate.  And in the strongest hurricanes on earth, most of those storms have been observed to have lightning.  

 But based on some observations, it has been hypothesize that we are headed toward a grand solar minimum.

"Stimiimuli.......No I think the ""scientist"" are smart and they think the public is stupid...A weather station in Hot Springs, Va., sits next to the wall of a steam power plant, yet NOAA still operates it. Yosemite park has weather stations with “heat sinks” (Large boulders)  objects that store heat, and then release it at night.  Generally in the form of inflated temperatures not representative of the broader area.  A lot of the weather stations have a concrete walkway to allow servicing. Concrete can absorb a lot of heat without warming up very much, concrete is a thermal mass materials, for example, if a concrete slab is exposed to direct sunlight it will be able to absorb and store a lot of heat and release it slowly....as in a sidewalk. All it would take is a few of these to throw the temps off a degree or two...maybe 1.6 degrees...?  You cannot take data from years ago before ""urban spread"" and create modern data temperature in these areas that are encompassed in a concrete jungle today. I personally witnessed in my own small town a weather station moved from beside a radio station on the outskirts of town and watched it relocated beside a hanger at the airport where it still sits.

Since 1880 when records were first started being kept the temperature has only risen 1.6 degrees on average using the data that were available at the time, the last climate report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that there had been no statistically significant increase in global surface temperature from 1998-2012. Recent research suggests that the Earth’s natural climate variability—natural, short-term fluctuations in the climate system that occur on a year-to-year basis or longer—may have played the most pivotal role of all by transferring excess heat from the Earth’s surface into the deep ocean.

 Actually, i personally didn't do any of that shit...  And tons of people apparently being not able to recognize what is definitely not just water vapour, is also not my fault.

 i've lived close to an international airport for a long time, seen many different kinds of planes over my house, year after year.. also seen many examples of legit con-trails, which you can tell by how they dissipate behind the plane just as quickly as the plane is moving.  Because WATER VAPOUR DISSIPATES . . .   and then there's the very many of the other different types of trails, that do not behave at all like clean con-trails. 
  i literally witnessed a moment one day last year when a plane was just taking off coming over my house, not leaving anything behind it.. and then very abruptly, a long-lasting trail seeming much thicker and slower than water vapour was suddenly being laid behind it...

Condensation doesn't get switched on like that.
