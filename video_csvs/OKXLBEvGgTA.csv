"I apply my dark shadows first and then apply a transitional shade to my brow to blend it out. Works well for me since I usually only use 2-3 shades for my eyeshadow, also I’ve noticed it makes blending that outer shade wayyyy easier.",0.5994,49
I came into this video expecting something like what the other gurus put up o YouTube (basically a bunch of throwing shade at the YouTube and half adding it with the products) but I was really surprised and I think I’m in love with your Chanel!,0.8917,51
