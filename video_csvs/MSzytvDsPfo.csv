"DEAR SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, 


Your show sucks. The only ones watching it, are freeloading liberals who have never been employed. Most, if not all, of the ""actors"" (and i use the term loosely), are nobodys. B movie hacks at best. Many of whom use your show to voice their liberal, uneducated  opinions. And in all likelihood, should kill themselves. 
Maybe you could do a show about Michelle Obongos penis. Or Barrys love for 8 year old Guatemalan boys. Or even Hillary and her rapist husband. You might improve if you make jokes about everything, rather than having a liberal agenda.

Do you think in 42 years that they haven't done the same thing, used the same ideas every few years when there's a new audience and gotten the same aging actors to come back on again that they had on 10 years ago? I stopped watching SNL years ago because it just got way too crude, stale and wasn't funny anymore but I can always count on Hallmark as a guilty pleasure at Christmas time to have some binge watching and forget about my own troubles for a while. It's nice to watch something with good morals ( no married people ever cheat), family values and love like it used to be and all the while, I'm not getting religion shoved down my throat.
