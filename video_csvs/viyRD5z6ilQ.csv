It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night",0.9769,114
