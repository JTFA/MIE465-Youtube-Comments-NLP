I bet you probably didn't even or  watch any of the Browns game that's been our weakness for so many years we get these quarterbacks that can't score in the red zone let alone to have any quarterbacks that can't stay healthy that's stupid. 

(And can stay away from the drugs)

Who? in the hell is the guy from UCLA we don't need him. We need a guy that's develop and ready those two quarterbacks you name ain't ready they will be ready later like 10 years in their time. We need someone who can move around move his feet.

Lamar Jackson is the best player for my team he the best player coming out of the NCAA. Don't make this an argument or tell me something different I know my team I know their weakness.

Lamar will do just fine in the NFL something like the others can't do when they get in the league.",0.3274,201

One of the best aquisitions in history you will see! He has everything, he stinks basketball, give him the keys he will open the other cities to his partners and will close the door during home games! He is intelligent, hardworking, he likes to look after and persevere on his lack, he will work to become better throughout his life! A gold man has landed in New York, take care ...

"The Truth - You and I might be the only ones who agree that it would be in the Cleveland Browns best interest to take Lamar Jackson over any of these other QBs. The only thing I keep hearing about all these ""other"" QBs is that they ""look"" the part!? Very coded language if you ask me. I never like making it about race, but it normally always boils down to that when a darker QB comes into the NFL with this kind of production in college.
The best point you made was about his mobility. Don't get it twisted; Darnold & Mayfield got wheels. But not-near-one-of-em got the NOS like LDJ. Lamar is on another planet when it comes to his playmaking ability!
And don't nobody dare talk about his arm; compact! swift release! tight spiral! This man can flat out launch it!
Put him behind Cleveland o-line with T Haley as the signal caller???

Ohh... bleep, bleep bleep...
I hope the Browns take him 1 overall!",0.967,195
