"(Depravity of False Teacher according to Apostle Peter):

But these, 
as natural brute beasts,
made to be taken and destroyed,
speak evil of the things 
that they understand not;
and shall utterly perish 
in their own corruption;

(Like natural brute beasts): False teachers are compared to animals in their behavior because they act in ignorance of the realities of death and judgment. Like animals, they also react only to present circumstances, without giving thought to the consequences of their actions).

and will receive 
the wages of unrighteousness
as those who count it pleasure 
to carouse in the daytime.
they are spots and blemishes 
carousing in their own deceptions 
while they feast with you,

(False teachers are perverse in their display of evil, like those who carouse in the daytime, Even pagan societies thought it strange and unnatural to hold drunken revels in broad daylight. However, the false teachers had no qualms about practicing their erroneous concept of Christians liberty in clear daylight. As a result, they would receive the wages of unrighteousness, that is, spiritual death. (Romans 6:23)<---For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
The heretics were so self-deceived that they actually thought they were celebrating their freedom in Christ with their drunken revelry at the Lord's table. In fact, they were spots and blemishes, disfiguring and degrading the purity of the Lord's feast).

Having eyes full of adultery and that
(((cannot cease from sin))),
enticing unstable souls.
They have a heart 
trained in 
(((covetous practices))),
and are accursed children.

(The eyes of the false teachers were full of adultery, They looked lustfully at women. they could not cease form sin because their fantasizing had become habitual. As a consequence, they convinced certain unstable souls in the church that adultery was acceptable Christian behavior and lured them into sexual immorality. Enticing means ""to catch with bait."" these new, unstable converts, not yet fully grounded in Christ, were easily booked into an immoral lifestyle).

They have forsaken 
the right way 
and gone astray,
following the way of Balaam 
the son of Beor
who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
But he was rebuked for his iniquity;
a dumb donkey 
speaking with a man's voice 
restrained the madness 
of the prophet.

(The account of Balaam in Numbers 22-24 is used here, as well as in Jude 11 and Rev 2:14, to depict the danger of forsaking the right way and going astray. Balaam's primary downfall was that he loved the wages of unrighteousness. He sold his prophetic powers to the pagan king Balak and, for a promised monetary reward, sought to curse the children of God).

These are wells without water,
clouds carried by a tempest,
for whom is reserved 
the blackness of darkness 
forever.

(Wells...clouds): Peter accuses the heretical teachers of awakening false expectations, like springs that contain no water or storm clouds that darken but produce no rain).

(2 Peter 2:12-17).

(DECEPTIONS OF FALSE TEACHERS/WOLVES IN SHEEP CLOTHING, according to Apostle Peter):

For when they speak 
great swelling words of emptiness,
they allure through the lusts of the flesh,
through lewdness,
the ones who have actually escaped 
from those who live in error.

(Allure); like enticing in verse 14, means ""to catch with bait."" The bait is great swelling words of emptiness, high-sounding promises that prove to have no real content. The hook is the lusts of the flesh, normal sexual desires that are practiced in wrong ways. the heretical teachers clearly were implying that once the soul is saved, (((((what is done in the body is of no importance))))). (Those who live in error): The guarding of the flock from ""wolves in sheep's clothing,"" as Jesus described false teachers, was one of the primary concerns of the apostles and is one of the chief tasks of pastors).

While they promise them liberty,
they themselves are the servants of corruption:
for of whom a man is overcome,
of the same is he brought in bondage.

(The irony of false teaching is that it promises great freedom 
while its advocates are already slaves to sin. The gospel offers release form the corruption of the world, but the false teachers were involved in moral ruin by their immoral practices and greedy motivations. These false teachers were probably twisting the christian concept of freedom from the law into a license for sinning). (See Paul's condemnation of this type of thinking in Romans chapter 6).

For if after they have escaped 
the pollutions of the world 
through the knowledge of 
the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
they are again entangled therein, 
and overcome,
the latter end is worse 
with them 
than the beginning.

(They have escaped): The subject of this phrase is the heretical teachers who are called ""slaves of corruption"" in verse 19. This verse seems to indicate that the teachers had formerly turned from the pollution of the world through a full and experiential knowledge of Christ. Now, however, they have fallen again into immorality, even becoming teachers of sinful lifestyles. As a result, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. This phrase is almost certainly taken from Jesus words in Matthew 12:45 and probably reflects Peter's memory of that occasion).

For it had been better for them
not to have known the way of righteousness,
than,
after they have known it,
to turn from the holy commandment
delivered unto them.

(Better...not to have known): KNOWLEDGE without OBEDIENCE IS DANGEROUS. Jesus said of Judas that it would have been better for him not to have been born than to have turned from the truth he had known. (See Matthew 26:24). The phrases way of righteousness and holy commandment emphasize the ethical content of the knowledge the false teachers had. They knew what was right and holy, but they deliberately chose to do what was wrong and corrupt).

But it is happened unto them 
according to the true proverb,
The dog is turned to his own vomit again;
and the sow that was 
washed to her wallowing in the mire.

(According to the true proverb): Jews considered dogs and pigs among the lowest of animals, so Peter chooses these animals to describe people who have known the truth but have turned away from it. (Proverb 26:11).

"For those who read this comment, Jesus Christ Loves you and knows what you're going through.
Life is hard, and He personally knows all about it. 

He died and rose again for you to live for eternity. Believe in Him, and His Love for you.

If you were to fully know what He has saved you from, you'd be living every day for Him. He is coming VERY soon, sooner than you think. 

Call on Him and be saved! Repent of your sins, turn to The Lord, for He is our salvation! He will forgive you of all sin if you sincerely seek and trust Him. 

In that day, when we are finally with Him, there will be no more tears or death, just peace and happiness.
