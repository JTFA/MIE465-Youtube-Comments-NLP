"How was this video made in 2018? A Captain Picard facepalm and about as many random = funny moments that I'll assume you simply hired an 8 year old ghostwriter.

 You're almost as awful as this movie, and even if it's intentional satire you seem to make 2x more equally horrendous flaws for every you point out in the movie. I'm almost surprised you didn't use an impact font meme, additionally the 24 second break after the admittedly awful anime sequence, various pauses for your audience to catch up to such a simple and pointless thought ( 9:16 ) only further cements in my brain the fact that you're either pandering to your audience or haven't ever heard of the concept of proofreading.

For as much as you complain about what you likely call cringe, you still can't muster up a video that anyone over the age of 12 could watch without vomiting at the combination of pointless shots of you talking to the camera and the meaningless words you spew out of your mouth during that time.

I can appreciate the difficulty in taking time to edit something like this, but you seem so out of touch with what qualifies as funny that this can be only appreciated as satire.",0.6697,222

This one shouldn't even place, it's not funny, the references aren't relevant, it's trying to hard and it's just stupid. At least the Cat was a cat, the Grinch hated Chrismas and the Lorax was orange!
