"Okay, so --
As a young lad, I was subscribed to many-a-YouTube channels.
The Lovely Grace Helbig being one of them.
And also tyler.

* tilde * notice my intentional disregard for capitalization * tilde *

I last watched such ""YouTubers"" in the year TooThousandAndForteen.
I then took myself a L O N G - A S S break from most social media.
Ya know, for like hippy-dippy, self-help bullshit.
I ascended and whatnot.
Livin' my best life, bein' my best me.
All that good white-people stuff.
So anyway, said hiatus has recently ended. 
After binging some Jenna Marbles, who never fails to impress, I stopped here.
To reestablish a relationship with these individuals.
Felt like checkin' in, just to see how things were going'.
WellLemmeTellYouSomthin' --
They. Are. The. Same.
THE SAME.
And here, all this time, I thought The Internet would go on without me.
Carry on, business as usual.
But no.
NO.
Everything stayed right where it was until I came back.
No variation in format, content, or quality.
Absolutely nothing.

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
