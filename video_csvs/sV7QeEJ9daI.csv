"(According to Jesus, you are supposed to take drastic measures to get the sin out of your life or you will suffer for it in Hell fire):

(JESUS):

Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, 
Thou shalt not commit adultery: 
But I say unto you,

That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her 
hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

But I say unto you, 
That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her 
hath committed adultery with her 
already in his heart.

And if thy right eye offend thee, 
pluck it out, and cast it from thee:

for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy
whole body should be cast into hell.

And if thy right hand offend thee, 
cut it off, 
and cast it from thee:

for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that

thy whole body

should be cast into hell.

(Matthew 5:27-30).

***(To Lust for her): A man who gazes at a woman with the purpose of wanting her sexually has mentally committed adultery.

***(I myself have done this in the past several times and because i love Jesus i have stopped it. This is how i deal with it in my life. If i see a very attractive female, i put the thought in my mind that this is someone's wife that God has ordained for someone else. That this is another mans other half.

And if demons put thoughts in my head, i say to them out loud and sometimes in my head, ""I rebuke that thought in Yeshua/Jesus name,"" then it leaves me. Because we all know that we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ when we die and when our Lord goes over our lives, he will see we tried not to think anything sexual about other men's wives. Believe me, it will be very hard in the beginning, but it will get easier and easier, trust me. The demons will know your not messing around anymore).

***Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and (((bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ))); (2 Corinthians 10:5).

***Jesus advises removing every temptation to evil, no matter what the cost. (Filthy movies, Pornography and staying away from bad influences from sinful people).

***Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. (2 Corinthians 2:11).

***Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
(1 Peter 2:11).

***The warning of HELL indicates that those whose lifestyle is characterized by uncontrolled immorality are not hears of the kingdom. (See 1 Corinthians 6:9-10).",-0.9778,576

"Dear friends Jesus Christ is ALWAYS WITH YOU! Upon accepting this truth, these 3 words will become like a safety net for you, protecting you from falling into despair. Because we are human, we will always have ups and downs in our life experiences. But the promise of the Presence of our Lord and Savior limits how far down we can go. Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down. Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. Dear ones, not only is Jesus with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory. All you have to do is say YES to Him this very moment and receive the promises of his unfathomable love. ❤️❤️❤️ (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",0.9897,236
