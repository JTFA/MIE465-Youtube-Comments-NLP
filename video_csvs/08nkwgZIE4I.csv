Another day another sin 💙,-0.5574,5
"Another day, another sin
 Another day I'm late again
Oh, just like that my money's spent
Where did it all go? 
Another night, another heart
Another one leaves in the dark 
And I'm searching for my counterpart
Where did they all go?

And I lock every single door
And I look behind me even more
Now turned into someone that I swore
I would never be

I wish I could go
Back to playing barbies in my room
They never say
That you gotta grow up, quite this soon
How fast things change
And now I'm here, and all I wanna do
Is go back to playing barbies in my room

And I see it on my father's face
Another line that comes with age
I know that time will have its way
Where did it all go?
They say that things were simple then
I don't remember when
I wanna know what happens next
Where do we all go?

And I lock every single door
And I look behind me even more
And now turned into someone that I swore
I would never be

Oh, I wish I could go
Back to playing barbies in my room
They never say
That you gotta grow up, quite this soon
How fast things change
And now I'm here, and all I wanna do
Is go back to playing barbies in my room

Pink canopies and grass-stained knees
Putting fireflies in a jar
Getting home before it's dark
Scotch-taping posters on my wall
Rolling pixie sticks to smoke
Couldn't wait 'till I was older

And I wish I could go
Back to playing barbies in my room
They never say
That you gotta grow up, quite this soon
How fast things change
But now I'm here, and all I wanna do
Is go back to playing barbies in my room
Back to playing barbies
Oh, I wish that I could go back
I wish that I could go back
I wish that I could go back Back to playing barbies in my room",-0.6379,357

"No matter how long it ever has been in between those moments in my life over the last 16 years of you being the only person I truly could relate to an be actually inspired by you as an music artist from the outside through my bones an your entire collective of old through to new has being at some points, although rarely would be ever feeling like waking up and playing your latest album or the classic misunderstood days an sing at the top of my lungs as I hear your words sing away my darkness an weakness by truly touching my heart by how you relate like no one ever in the world. No matter when it may be or what era or prompt for a pink inspirational moment it will being, I knew if I ever lost my worth through the world an its monsters an my self love was as thin an spare as silk beaten of belief in myself an all it would be, would be your voice in my head an I felt it was one of them moments an you always kept me going with the femfatale of truth an a reinstallment of enough fuck the world an strength to be capable of having the courage to pick myself up again, dust myself down, look at my reflection an give myself a pep grin an laugh at the world an have full respect for myself an when the entire life around you creates the oppressive opperssition of haters and bullies abusers an the fake friends an monsters in disguise kicking u when ur down, all it took was one pink moment, an it was reviving my self worth an trust I was ready to show the world and myself I'm getting back up and I'm reinstated with a bigger bolder and more braver than I've ever been before. Thanks pink for 16 years of sparing my self value and speaking to my heart. When my head was full of haters projectives and negatives that clouded my perception, you never let me down an I grown stronger an wiser an fierce than I wouodnof ever been if you hadn't of brought your words to my ears an wake me up when I needed to be shaken up. Truly my twinsoul an a guru of self esteem an inspiration I'd never meet but felt like we could be very well related or twins in life how much I've never found in another the perfect saviour of song and singing what lifted me from ever feeling less of a person or inferior an be proud of being myself an alone without letting the world's hate make me lonely.

"While I love this song, and I truly do love it, what I don't understand is why one can't simply do the things mentioned in the song? As adults, we have this tendency to distance ourselves from our childhood, and yet simultaneously yearn for it, which is incredibly cognitively dissonant. My suggestion: If you like Barbies, go buy some and play. I'm a strawberry shortcake girl myself and...I don't really care that I'm 29. I like Strawberry Shortcake. I've got dolls and I do play. Screw age, just do what makes you happy and anytime someone ever tells you to grow up or act your age, simply respond ""How can I act my age when I've never been this old before?""",0.9679,141

"“For children, childhood is timeless. It is always the present. Everything is in the present tense. Of course, they have memories. Of course, time shifts a little for them and Christmas comes round in the end. But they don’t feel it. Today is what they feel, and when they say ‘When I grow up,’ there is always an edge of disbelief—how could they ever be other than what they are?” - Ian McEwan",-0.34,93
