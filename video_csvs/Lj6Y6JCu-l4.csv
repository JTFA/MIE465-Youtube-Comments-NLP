Catchy but the breaking of the things was a little excessive. This must've been an expensive shoot to film. I'm thinking the money could've been best used for better uses like maybe some cool lighting or lyrics in a cooler font like Verdana or Museo Sans Serif.,0.9517,50

"Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs
 
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware
 
Of just how we got,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
 
I know we meant
All good intentions
 
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
 
Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen
 
Floors are wet
Taps are still running
Dishes are broken
 
How did we get,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
 
I know we meant
All good intentions
 
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
 
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just...
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
