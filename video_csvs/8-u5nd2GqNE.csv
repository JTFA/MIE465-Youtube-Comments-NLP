She has 16 legally distinct crowns. While she could give all of them to Charles, she could separate them and give them to different people. Imagine Britain getting a king, and Antigua getting a king, and Australia getting a queen, etc.
She could even give out two crowns.
The Canadian, Antiguan, and Kittian crowns could be given to one person called ""The King of America"", or Australia and New Zealand getting one monarch from the two crowns, becoming ""The Queen of the Tasman"".

It's very likely Charles will get all 16, which is disappointing, because I would have _loved_ to get a more personal monarch for my country.
Elizabeth's great, Charles might be too, but can you imagine how awesome it would be to have a King living out in Sydney in his own Palace? What would a modern palace even look like?",0.9286,181
