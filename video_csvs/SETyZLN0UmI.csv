Every Marine would buy one and they would get sooo much business. It would be the coolest thing.... They could make a civilian edition for people who support our country and military that is painted as the American flag or don't tread on me flag....Everyone pro American would buy one. They could just make it a special edition truck. Like it could be a special edition of the reaper. Think about how everyone paints and details there trucks like that anyways? We need something positive as Americans in this time of crisis and as an American with a family with generations upon generations of proud Chevy owners I think this could fill that need. When they present it just have Veterans there and announce how it's American made for Americans! Give some away to wounded fighting men who honorably served their country and make them wheelchair ready for the men who gave their mobility for this country. As Americans we need this! As Chevy customers we need to be reassured that Chevy is on our side and American supporting our military active, former and of course the ones who never made it home. A memorial on the tailgate for every American revolutionary war to current that memorializes ever man who has given it all for this country so when some antifa a**holes is driving behind you then can feel bad for being an a**hole.

Sorry man tired of all the Tundra fans that are still sucking Toyota's dick after all these years. The 5.7 is a gas guzzler that leaks oil like a V8 out of the 60's, the rear axle is famous for carrier problems/seal leaks/premature bearing failures, the front diff is famous for grinding noises and failures because Toyota refuses to fix the design issues, the shitty overpriced AIP's have left guys stranded for years, the much hyped ""Triple-Tech"" frame is marketing speak for a cheap and flimsy c-channel frame famous for rust rot, the rear bed was clearly not designed for salty winter conditions as the layered sheetmetal construction traps moisture and salt leading to premature rust rot, the tailgate's construction and poor corrosion treatment leads to premature rust rot, the interior is cheap and reeks of late 90's Camry, the 6-speed AB60E was a terrible choice for a transmission but because Toyota cuts every corner possible - they went with it despite the terrible gear ratios that suck for truck use and instead compensated for the shitty gear ratios with that ridiculous rear axle ratio, etc. Toyota has claimed for 3 or 4 years now that Tundra customers don't mind that it's only getting 17 mpg highway and that they don't think Toyota needs a more efficient half-ton -- in other words Toyota doesn't give a damn how much gas the Tundra guzzles, they aren't spending a dime of the profits to improve the old 5.7 (not even the oil leak problems or VVT issues), the rust rotting frame, the flimsy weak frame deisgn, the shittynold interior, the ancient 6 speed transmission, etc. And while they're at it, Toyota is going to rob Tundra owners blind by charging $1000+ for air pumps that are identical to air pumps sold for $80 by AC Delco. They are literally identical, but because Toyota's name is slapped on it, Toyota expects you to pay a nearly 1000% mark-up. It also took a multi-billion dollar lawsuit that Toyota spent tens of millions fighting, in order to get them to address all the rotted 2nd gen Tundra frames. The fanboys LOVE to claim that Toyota were saints that replaced everybody's shit frame out of the goodness ofmtheir heart, when the reality is that Toyota knew for decades that their body-on-frame trucks and SUV's had severe, aggressive rust rot problems and didn' do shit until the government was close to forcing a recall. They ""recalled"" some frames -- the ones that had rust so bad there were big holes in the frame. And if there weren't holes 10mm or larger, they sprayed shitty undercoating  over the slowly rotting frame and said hit the road. 

In other words, fuck the flimsy POS Tundra and fuck Toyota.",-0.9969,516

justin h it's shows they don't care about gas engines in hd trucks. It's doesn't mean the 6.0 is bad. It's very reliable. They make more diesels because they sell more diesels. Supply and demand companies are not here to please you they are here to make money believe it or not.,-0.822,57
