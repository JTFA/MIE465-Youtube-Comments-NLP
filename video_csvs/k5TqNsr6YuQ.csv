Hi I'm a guy from Cuba who dies listening to your live music in Havana was where Diplo gave a concert in my country I love what you do and I follow you thanks to the slow internet in my country but I only connect very little on the internet and I decided to risk writing this text for you just hoping you make everyone happy with your music and especially me because I really identify with each of your songs and all of them have a very positive message in each letter. I love and I admire you for everything you do hoping that someday you sing in my country to sleep and get up with a smile on my face I wish you all the best please do not stop reading this message is very important for me do not have time but how nice it would be to make a moment for me and read this text that is beautiful for me to write for you my name is Milton Gonzalez Mederos I am 21 years old like you and I am a good singer thanks to my registration vocal aaaa and I love WILD I love you very much luck you this Cuban.,0.9982,209
