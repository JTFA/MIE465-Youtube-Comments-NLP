"I had a seasonal job at TRU last year. It made my day to see kids shopping for other kids that had it rough. I was the local Geoffrey mascot and I am glad I wore a costume because hugging the kids and hearing them tell me to tell Santa about what kids want, always made me bust out crying. Growing up dirt poor allowed me to see the world from a different angle and I know you will make a difference in some little kid's life. My donated treasures as a kid were books. Thanks for buying books!! *crap, trying to not cry now*",0.7928,116
