"He really wasn't. I know Timothee has so many fangirls, but Daniel has been putting in the talent and work for over a decade now, and it's finally paying off for him. He's also British, and this award probably means a lot to him.",0.8857,50
"He said ""there's a countdown""",0.0,7
He was good but nothing special in 'get out'. Jordan Peele should have hired a black American actor instead.,-0.2351,23
