"Verse 1

I don't have enough time
to say the things I want to say
to do the things I want to do
or to be like you
I just want some time
to express the things I feel
just to express the things I feel
and believe them too.
Two plus two has been four for
so many darn years Oh lo-ord
I wanna write a song
oh baby is that just so wrong?
And it goes

La de da de da de da de day oh

La de da de
La da dee dum

La da dee day
when will you come back home?
Verse 2
I went down to the mall
then they closed down the mall
guess they don't want me going to the mall
'cause I'm just too small. (too small for the mall)
Then I built some trains
and I'm travelling somewhere new
it's a wonderful world
still no you.
It's a wonderful world for two.
singin'
Chorus 2
La de da de da de da de day oh
la de da de where did all the bad times roll?
'said La de da de
La da dee dum
La da de day
when can you come back home?

Verse 3 (quiet)
I just went online
to explain the things I feel
to express the things I mean
and it felt so real

Now I'm doing alright
and I'm down right fellin' okay
it's the end of the world
and I just can't wait
