"""BRITISH chemist Humphry Davy, who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal, is credited as the person who named aluminium. In 1808, he suggested the metal be named alumium.[93] This suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from France, Germany, and Sweden, who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide, alumina, from which it would be isolated.[52] In 1812, Davy chose aluminum, thus producing the modern name.[94] However, it is spelled and pronounced differently outside of North America: aluminum is in use in the U.S. and Canada while aluminium is in use elsewhere.[95]""

"+Bind Truth _""I am really glad that this film has done so well and hopefully, it will open more opportunities for black leading roles in Hollywood.""_

While that is certainly a possibility, what it really means is audiences are willing to see films that studios have been historically unwilling to make. The implication is studios can potentially use more diverse ideas and source material to make films and stay true to the cultures and genders of the characters.

Black Panther goes a long way to proving audiences are willing to see films lead by people of color or women; provided they're good, which many of the previous ones were not.",0.9652,123

Which means the tracking figure which keeps going up and up was projected to be 235 million for the 4 day weekend but now has been adjusted to 242 million. The exact number is 241.96 million so $40,000 away from 242 million.

With these new numbers, officially Black Panther has passed The Last Jedi for the second biggest opening 4 day weekend. 

Stars Wars the Force Awakens (288 million)
Black Panther (242 million)
Star Wars The Last Jedi (241 million)

Marvel is just smashing it now and now its Infinity War's turn to break some records.

I didn't go with them since the crowds were nuts, would of rather of gone another week but they went out again on Sunday. 

The only time I have ever saw this kind of need to see Black Panther was Star Wars the Force Awakens. After they saw it once, they needed to bring in more people to see it with more people. The last Jedi wasn't like this for us. So as ""event"" Movies goes, Black Panther is a true event movie that people want to go with big groups.",-0.8725,277

"I‚Äôm stoked that Black Panther achieved this overwhelming success so soon after Wonder Woman. The one-two punch of Wonder Woman and Black Panther makes me confident that Hollywood will learn the right lessons from all this. The right lessons being to notice under-served demographics, hire competent, dedicated people from within those demographics to helm projects, and to give these audiences what they crave. This approach leads to quality genre films that transcend conventional (out-dated) wisdom about what is successful ‚Äì both in the US and abroad. I‚Äôm sure Dan will discuss this later today, but Black Panther blew away estimates at the international box office too. 

Black Panther is such a clear example of the power of representation. Representation is not (as detractors would have us believe) about ticking off boxes or ""being PC."" Representation is important because it leads to creative people with a different range of experiences to draw from, because it gives us a new kinds of stories and new perspectives on old stories, because it re-energises whole genres. Representation makes things better.",0.974,201

"List of superhero movies to have made 1 billion dollars worldwide:
1) The Avengers at 1.5 billion
2) Avengers: Age of Ultron at 1.4 billion
3) Iron Man 3 at 1.2 billion
4) Captain America: Civil War at 1.1 billion
5) The Dark Knight Rises at 1.08 billion
6) The Dark Knight at 1 billion
As of right now, Black Panther is on track to join this elite club, and with the limited competition it has, along with the overwhelming positive word of mouth, this film COULD do near Avengers type numbers at 1.4 or 1.5 billion. I think it'll end up at like 1.25 billion, edging out Iron Man 3, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it gets past Age of Ultron.

MD films never get complex enough to really dig into the themes they present. It‚Äôs all surface level basics. DC films get to the center of what makes these characters tick.",-0.4033,80
"Movient And you have the right to disagree. But I‚Äôll take the DK Trilogy, MoS, WW and BvS Ultimate cut over any Marvel Disney film. Those were sophisticated, well made, well directed movies, that actually had subtle acting and heartfelt moments of drama, where the consequences of their actions meant more to the plot and mental state of those characters going forward. DC WB films give these characters a personality above the buddy talk and shallow relationships and dialogue that pervade MD films.

If you think drama doesn‚Äôt count in giving those action scenes gravitas, then you are the audience MD want, and that‚Äôs fine. But I like my characters with personal  imperfections they can reflect on, so when they rise to the occasion, it doesn‚Äôt seem like a mission or a duty - it seems earned through strength of character. MD films don‚Äôt do that for me; it‚Äôs always a shallow look into those characters, that seems like depth, but there‚Äôs nothing deeper underneath, because MD is trying to appeal to everyone, and do, do their best to avoid anything that might possibly offend the sensitive, and that boring. And so we get a bunch of dialogue that basically amounts to we-have-to-go-there-and-stop-bad-guy-or-else-boom-for-the-world. Then they make money selling toys to kids. That‚Äôs not integrity, that‚Äôs a factory trying to milk people out of money.

"Yes, Roth, Yes! Superstore is so underappreciated! I'm not saying it's as great as The Office, but it's got that potential. I've been waiting for it to blow up, but it still hasn't. The critics are all on board, we just need the rest of America to be on board as well. Maybe once it goes into syndication it'll go big. The Big Bang Theory didn't get to be the juggernaut it is until it went into syndication. I know, I watched the first two seasons and I only had one other friend to talk about it with.",0.9339,112
"Yes, TLJ was Star Wars. A shame that a very angry internet mob doesn't seem to recognize that. 

But then, it had Luke stay in character. And that was never going to be a popular decision among those who prefer to only remember him sparing his father's life, and making friends with a smuggler.",-0.6997,61

"samuraigundam0079 I disagree with you, I think aou was still good, it‚Äôs still better than anything DC/WB has put out lately. Marvel movies are the better quality of films, just look at how DC is still scrambling to produce a great film. They are basically blind when it comes to there properties. You are right to n one thing, money doesn‚Äôt display the quality of film it is, however the money does determine weather the audience is liking the film. Black Panther for example another big weekend $108 mill.",0.9186,107
"samuraigundam0079 I don‚Äôt know about that, I believe the Marvel characters have dept, the characters don‚Äôt seem to have to much dept are the villains, except Loki and Killmonger the rest don‚Äôt. 

I like DC characters they are my favorites, but WB have don an injustice with those characters. MoS I did like and WW, but the rest were just not good. 

The Movie Logan that character has dept, so does the Black Panther. a movie doesn‚Äôt have to have a dark tone for the characters to have dept. just look at CA WS, or CA CW, Antman That character is broken, he was basically a convict. 

Now not all MD films are great, IronM2 üëé, IronM3üëé,  Dr Stangeüëéjust to name a few. Thor Ragnorock his character had layers. If I want to see dramatic character I will go see an Oscar contender, but I like my heroes to be fun and entertaining, not dark and brooding. U also mention the extended version of BvS. Why did we have to wait for WB to release a directors cut, that bs. They should of released the directors cut in the theatrical release, not the trash we got at the theaters. Yes the movie is better but some of the issues from the original release is there. But let‚Äôs be honest here, as good as MoS was or maybe even BvS and SS those films were divisive, some people like them some didn‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt. WB went to faraway from the source material. 

I guess we have to disagree on DC and Marvel. People trust Marvel and as long as those movie are good people will continue to go see them. Avengers infinite war is going to kill it in the box office. HAIL MARVEL",0.9798,350
