I watched the video and it said they started dating a few years back. Meaning they hadn't been dating till then. There's no evidence she's a gold digger but no evidence that says otherwise either. 

Okay my point was you saying he doesn't get ass and constantly getting friend zoned. ""Friend zoning"" is something that normally happens to teens. Teens don't WANT ass, seriously. It's the place where shit comes from and I still don't understand why it's so sexualized. I was just trying to say you should'nt have put the ""ass"" part. Seriously, teenage boys aren't fuck boys. The guy probably doesn't want ass.

Safiya Rani that’s true. But going into a relationship with someone you’ve known since you were a child is different than meeting a stranger in 2015 and getting married in 2018.

Friends, trust and rest in this love! 

He will save you from your sins, He will deliver you from your bondages, but most importantly you will be forgiven.

He will also make a Way for us to escape the oncoming judgement that is headed towards this earth. He already took our punishment upon Himself on the cross, so He already made a Way to escape! Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!
