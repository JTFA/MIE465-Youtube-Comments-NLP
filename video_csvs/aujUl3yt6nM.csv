"Quad9 is an initiative from the Global Cyber Alliance.  They are funded at least for now by various law enforcement agencies, government agencies and cyber security firms although they are talking with other DNS providers to replicate Quad9 as a global service.

"" The Quad9 service is free, but it does need to be continually funded. GCA 
is a non-profit—so the long-term growth of the service is based largely 
on government and industry continuing to fund it. GCA itself was funded 
initially with $25 million in criminal asset forfeiture directed to the 
organization by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Rettinger 
said that GCA is talking with other major DNS providers about how they 
can replicate Quad9's service, however—so there's a chance that GCA may 
be absorbed into the greater Internet's infrastructure.""
