"Exactly. What I meant to say is, they are not made to survive the human lifetime. they go extinct, or kill each u other in wild hunt anyway.

"I just received my Latte palette in the mail this week and it is gorgeous! I especially love Cold Brew and Double Shot and the balance of mattes and shimmers / foils. The palette itself is very nicely made and feels substantial, down to the thicker plastic guard sheet inside. The shadows are so buttery and easy to work with. Can't wait to see what you come out with in the future!!",0.9554,79
I just switched to this account so I'm new from this account but I've been following you for a few months now from 09mychavez account. I just want to tell you that I love you and your channel! You're so awesome and I bought your palette and can't wait to get it! I used to be really into makeup in high school and college but as I stated having kids and my skin got older the makeup didn't look good on me anymore. I wear very little makeup and I haven't kept up with new trends. But since I've been watching you you've inspired me to get into makeup again. I'm starting little by little cuzeverything I want to try is so expensive so I have to plan my budget and save ahead. But I just want to say Thank you! Love you and Congratulations! Wish you success and joy 😘💕😊,0.9954,162

"I want to let you know that I'm here because I was over on Jackie Aina's ch, a woman whom I find to be completely in tune with what's happening in the world of beauty and cosmetics! I am someone who respects and admires Jackie's work so when she did an eye look using your new palette, Jackie began the look by closing her eyes and saying the following ""...Nobody deserves more happiness and success than Miss Christen Dominique!"". Jackie then went on to say how happy she was for you and ""Christen Dominique is just So Nice, and like So Pure and So Sweet and like honestly when I found out she was coming out with her own line I was like...That's like the dream!"" Hearing Jackie say that I was really interested in seeing what was to come! Then came the test! We all know that Jackie is known for her sometimes painfully honest product reviews and she's, over time, proven to me that her opinions are pretty much spot on but the final decision is, and will always be, my own! So, I watched and what I saw was something REALLY SPECIAL, Christen! I'll let you in on a little secret of mine! Many times, when I watch reviews of products, I mute the sound and just watch! I watch the application from start to finish and then go back and unmute. What the reviewer says is important to me but what I see with my own eyes is what I trust most of all! I watched Jackie apply your shadows and they were seemingly applying with great ease and I loved the end result! While watching I didn't see any fallout and was wondering if Jackie was noticing the same (remember, I had her on mute!). I watched her build color and thought, that's a great option to have because it's a working palette that will have a broader appeal! And I noted the range of colors and the mix of both mates and foils which were great eye look makers! So from what I could see, I felt I was looking at a really nice palette! Now it was time to turn up the volume and listen to what Ms. Jackie O had to say! Yup! Just as I thought! She LOVED your palette and all of my observations (plus some) were verbally expressed by Jackie as well! Let it be known that I AM NOT a beauty guru by any stretch of the imagination BUT, I like what I like! I am an everyday consumer who I think is pretty good at knowing a quality product when I see it. That and having awesome influencers like Jackie Aina give their professional perspective on products are valuable tools to have in anyone's toolbox arsenal! So, congratulations, Ms. Christen Dominique! I plan to buy your palette and IM SURE I'll be just one among MANY! I look forward to seeing all you have in store for the future of your cosmetics line and if this is any indications of what's to come, it will be a bright future, INDEED! 💐 Bravo! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽...",0.9991,597
