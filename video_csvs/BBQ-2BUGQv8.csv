(Kristian Harloff and his horrible theater) what a movie that would be.,-0.5423,15
"1) Yes, having been in love with the EU is painfully known to me that it's no longer canon. I'm just saying that even there Luke was touched by the Dark Side, more than once, and no one ever complained.
2) The only way we know there is still good in Vader is because Luke says he SENSED so (and Obi-Wan, a Force Ghost, a being that is one with the force and should know whether this is true or not, doesn't believe him). You are never, not even once, shown a hint of this goodness in the OT. So what, should we trust Luke's perception when he says there is good in his father, but not when he says he sensed a great darkness in his nephew? That is really arbitrary.
3) It's easier to say ""No!"" to an apparent evil (The Sith Emperor telling you to turn to the Dark Side), to be brave in the face of a clear and present danger, but fear of the future is a more insidious threat (i have visions of my nephew becoming the new Vader, and he is already on a dark path, what should i do to prevent it? How far would i go?).
Remember, Anakin Skywalker betrayed his own Order and plunged the galaxy in darkness, just because he was desperate to prevent his visions of Padme's death to come true. And again, I don't see many people complaining about that. Why should we judge the son more strictly than the father?
4) And finally, a quick thought on Luke's exile and ""cowardice"". How come that when Yoda decided to go into exile (instead of  - i don't know,  maybe organizing a resistance to the Empire?), leaving de facto the galaxy in the hands of the Sith Lords, sworn enemy of the Jedi, not a single soul (not even I) called bullshit? We bought it, because he was distraught. So why we think Luke should have been different, when for him the pain was even more personal?",-0.9901,399

"All the hate for this movie blows my mind. Yeah it has flaws, but when people say “it’s terrible” and give it a half star review, they’re just blinded by their own hate. I loved it still. Kylo and Rey were amazing in this one. That fight scene they had together was epic

Edit: I see what all the people hating this movie are saying I really do. I didn’t care for Leia pulling a mary poppins, I wish Snoke/the Knights of Ren had a little more back story, some humor was forced, it would be cool if there was a lightsaber battle. Like I said I know it has flaws, but I decide to look at its best moments rather than hate the whole thing because I’m upset with a few things. 

One thing I will continue to disagree on tho is Luke. People said he was terrible. Well if your nephew turned evil and killed all the Jedi and then burned the Jedi temple you would be shook too. Luke’s character was well written I thought. His story was one of self forgiveness and redemption.",-0.9119,220

"As a big fan who has been to more than half the Celebrations I will make this simple.

Every choice she is making since JJ did his Fan Film (Which was great that's not a knock). The Last Jedi was a wonderful film it made me cry 4 times the first time and twice the second.

This movie chooses to ignore everything. The force awakens asked questions that this film chooses to either disregard or answer in the most vague and underwhelming manner almost to make a point. Is says fuck you to everyone that made a prediction or speculation on questions THEY posed in Force awakens. This is an annoying douche film that made 220 mil... being unpredictable for the sake of being unpredicatable and bold doesnt make it good. Everything should be done for the benefit of the story.

"I agree with Kristian. There's certainly reactionary over the top ""fans"" saying that this is the worst - not even just Star Wars but - movie ever made. But there's also many people that just feel off about it. And it can be for various reasons. I really love/hate this movie. It's beautifully made and directed, wonderfully acted, terrifically written moments. But, it's also full of empty payoffs, plot lines that go nowhere, characters acting out of character (while doing so expertly), plot devices that just don't make sense, etc. It's like beautiful moments wrapped in utter bullshit wrapped in a beautiful story outline.

I definitely had my opinion of the way things should go. Some went the way I thought. Some didn't go the way I thought. Some went the way I thought but was really accelerated (the stuff that happened in the throne room, the way Luke's journey ended, the relationships between characters were all pretty close to what I was guessing, but I was guessing them for IX). I'm not completely satisfied with the decisions on those things, but I can deal with most of them. But what I don't like is so many little (and sometimes big) details all throughout the film. The First Order is needlessly incompetent - perhaps more than the FO or Empire ever have been before. Holdo has zero reason for her actions - Poe was right to do what he did based on the information he had. The space chase was absolutely pointlessly mishandled. Finn's story was an absolute waste with no payoff. I really liked Rose, but her hero moment was idiotic. etc., etc., etc.

It's the story stuff. The details. I feel like 1) The was very little collaboration between JJ and Rian and that Rian probably didn't care what happened in TFA, he just had his story in his mind that he wanted to tell and 2) similarly, Rian could see the forest, but couldn't see the trees. A very similar movie movie could have been made with the same basic outline, but easily could have been far more interesting and logical. Again, I'm not talking moment details. The production was amazing and there was a lot of thought given to visual details, but the story details didn't always seem very well thought through.

Like Tommy Wiseau, Rian is tearing me apart. When TLJ is good, it's REALLY good. Some of the absolute best stuff in the franchise. But when it's bad, it's really, really awful.

TLJ is a better directed film, but I am pretty sure TFA has less things that I consider to be real flaws. As long as Rian can figure out his finer details better, I look forward to seeing what else he has that's all new for the franchise. JJ has never been a closer. I'm confident that he'll make an overall good movie, but there's directing mistakes he needs to improve on and I hope he brings his A game to prove he can successfully and satisfactorily close it out.

Also, just to throw this in there one more time, I never thought that TLJ would be the particularly dark and gloomy movie everyone seemed to think. I never understood that. I haven't seen everything he's done, but I never got that impression from him. His Breaking Bad stuff was good, but not overly dark. The whole show was kind of dark. Looper was good, but I was actually disappointed in that, too. Because of the details of the story. Hm. Fantastic moments. Cool overall story. Poorly thought out details... Also, not really that dark. Right amount of dark for the subject, but also kind of hopeful in a way. And Brothers Bloom. I had a lot of fun with that one. Apparently I should see Brick.",0.9986,734

"I enjoy & hear all of your views but pump the brakes a bit.. it's not about the energy of ""The Last Jedi"" it's about having a consistent - cohesive story with the lore & mythology.  As an example.. it seemed the story telling was a bit lazy at times.. especially not knowing why Rey & Snoke are so powerful in both the light & dark side of the Force..even after the events of TFA...major characters like that should be fleshed out a bit more.  It just felt empty at times not knowing more.  Yes, there's a few great moments in the film.. however there's alot of surrounding moments 'not so good' that can leave not only the casual movie goer but a die hard SW fan like myself scratching our heads.  If you're going to take risks.. that's ok but just back it up.   I understand they want to go in another direction & setup new stories, with a new trilogy.. while keeping certain vibes a bit more PC/current..but that shouldn't divert from good story telling either.  It's all subjective.. yes but it's important to truly understand & respect both sides (just like the Force).  Again this is respectfully my view & my opinion.   I still continue to love Star Wars & even more so now, I find myself actually having a new respect for all the previous episodes including Rogue One.  SW is the greatest saga ever & I truly hope the franchise goes in the right direction so we can learn more from all our new heroes & iconic characters from the past.  This is what the passion for Star Wars does best - gets us to share, talk & inspire.  May the Force be with you all!!!",0.996,330

"Luke at first was going to KILL Vader to protect his sister. He stopped only because Palpatine had to run his wizened old mouth, and his gloating made him realize he was about to do something terrible. If the Emperor had not interfered, Vader may have been dead and Sidious would have a new apprentice.
Now, Luke has the responsibility to bring back the Jedi order from scratch, and he realizes his nephew, Vader's grandchild, a very powerful Force user, is going down the same path of Anakin Skywalker, threatening to destroy everything Luke has put so much work in rebuilding.
Bear also in mind that the more powerful in the Force a Jedi is, the more exposed to the temptations of the Dark Side he will be (and in the EU Luke has had many brushes with it, and even fallen to it at one time).
I think that a split second of fear and doubt is understandable, and he immediately regrets it, too. Unfortunately, it happened at the worst moment possible.
So no, I don't believe this to be a betrayal of the character.",-0.989,210
"Luke's character would have gladly sacrificed his life to save Darth Vader, the killer of kids and the Jedi...but now he's going to kill the only son of his twin and his best friend?

"Mario Popescu Luke never left a map. That was the map for the first jedi temple, put together by combining, the one in the Imperial Archives, the one found by Lor San Tekka (the old dude Kylo kills in Ep.VII) and the incomplete memory banks of R2-D2. They weren't even sure Luke would be there.
As for Luke's exile and ""cowardice"", i don't know if I could look my sister and my best friend in the eye and tell them that no only i failed to keep their only son on the Light Side, but that in my one moment of weakness i pushed him further into the dark. Also to see the Jedi order he had barely rebuilt from nothing fall back into nothing, i think it would be pretty disheartening.
And how come that when Yoda decided to go into exile (instead of  - i don't know,  maybe organizing a resistance to the Empire?), leaving de facto the galaxy in the hands of the Sith Lords, sworn enemy of the Jedi, not a single soul (not even I) called bullshit? We bought it, because he was distraught. So why we think Luke should have been different, when for him the pain was even more personal?",-0.9793,238

But this film--TLJ--has tonal issues, foreshadowing issues and narrative pacing issues. Basic storytelling is weak. Simple as that.

"So after avoiding as many reviews/spoilers as I could, I went in and didn't know what to expect. I did hear that Last Jedi had mix reviews, also a few of my friends hated it. I tried to keep my expectation as even as I could, not to high and not to low. My thoughts!!! I didn't like it, I don't hate it. As a film it was OK, if the name isn't 'Star Wars'. With TFA I thought was fun, it was on the safe side, understandably especially after the prequels. But TFA still had that Star Wars spirit, a 7.5/10. Then R1 which I enjoyed more than TFA, it was little darker in tone, but still had that Star Wars spirit, a 8.5/10. Now to the Last Jedi....... The tone felt off? Hard to describe, it was dark, then light, with out of place jokes. I didn't feel that Star Wars spirit? I'm all for making change, taking a new direction. If the changes and direction contribute and enhance the story and characters, I'm all for it. But if anything, it wasted characters like Snoke and Captain Phasma. Luke, is not the Luke I grew up with? Finn and Rose sub plot did nothing. Then Leia becomes Super girl? With TFA and R1 I watched them 3 times each, I don't think I could watch the TLJ again.

"The Last Jedi is unlike any movie I have seen.  I Loved and Hated it at the same time.  

Poe's arc really worked for me (aside from purple hair).  It's not Laura Dern's performance it's costume and makeup and lack of development.  I just didn't care about her character.  If you replace Holdo with Admiral Akbar you have a home run in that story arc.  Oscar Issac killed it really pleased to see he was front and center!  Space battles were AMAZING! 

Rey and Kylo was Perfection for me the chemistry and exchanges had me mesmerized!  Throne Room was great!  Snoke served his purpose.  He established Kylo's power going into film 3.  This will help the final act of the trilogy tremendously.  JJ will be able to focus on the 2 we care about Rey and Kylo not distractions.  This intertwined arc was perfect!

The director take on Luke was the single biggest risk no question.  I think over time I will appreciate it more.  but let's face it Luke was out of character. The purity of Luke Skywalker is sacred in cinema history.  This risk was inevitablygoing to lead to division among the fan base.  Is Luke going to kill his nephew?  Come on Rian clearly you aren't an uncle.  If my nephew was going dark I'd go with him!! I'd never leave him alone or give up on him EVER.  Bit out of touch. (Vader had a far greater trauma turning him to dark thoughts. Kylo was having bad dreams) Not what I would have done but I can live with it and hopefully appreciate it over time. 

The biggest miss has to be Finn's arc and Captain Phasma.  Rian Johnson fucked that arc up. I seriously can't even imagine it being any worse. I can honestly say I will be fast forwarding 80% of his arc. I'll watch him wake up and meet up with Poe and the action on Crait.  Everything in between was unwatchable.   Oh an don't get me started on the waste of potential with Phasma. Huge mistake killing her off.  Should have saved her for 9 and a final showdown with Finn.  Utilized even less than Boba Fett!! Which was criminal then and it is criminal now...

A star wars movie without a light saber on light saber battle was also a mistake.  

So all in all I'm at a 6.5/10 after my first viewing.  I could see it moving up after additional viewing. possible 7.5/10

We didn't need cutesy cgi characters. Obviously there is a suspension of disbelief required to enjoy Star Wars but the magic of the OT was that it was grounded and felt tangible. The shortcoming of the prequels was that they lacked this element and everything was done on green screen. The moments with Luke, Rey and Kylo were fantastic. This movie just was inconsistent in tone. It's a weird one, my eyes teared up at times at others I actually cringed. That's ultimately why I think the critics and fans are so divided.

   As a big fan Im starting to realize how open minded I am now and how fussy and picky most of the hardcore fans can actually be.

And that’s just bad script writing and bad decision making as far as I’m concerned, WTF are we supposed to believe that a snails pace chase in space could be viable ? Or how about that Rey was just imbued with all the natural force gifts and powers without having to train or develop them ? When Luke and Anakin and Obi-Wan had to learn them over an entire life time ? Oh and btw notice how all the females in this movie don’t have any weakness, and that they’re the characters that seem to be the ones coming to the rescue of the males ? 
IE: Rose saves Flynn
IE: Laura Dern’s Holdo saves the entire remainder of the fleet by sacrificing herself ?
Did you notice that Poe is constantly treated like a little boy who didn’t finish his peas and carrots ?
Or how about when Luke doesn’t even have to use his lightsaber but just danced around while Rey and Emo Kylo mop up the best trained pretorian guard in 30s or so ?
Fuck Disney for turning Star Wars and the best characters ever developed into fucking hacks and weak douche canoes, take your silly SJW emo characters and stick it. If you think this film wasn’t made by a feminist for a feminist agenda keep drinking your pink cool aid and hope for a happy place to appear. FYI I’m a woman and have two kids, I have no desire or belief that this movie would inspire them in anyway as previous movies did and the entire point of star wars was to instil HOPE in people all across the galaxy, but this movie didn’t instil a bloody thing except that a woman doesn’t have to work hard or train hard but instead is has all the gifts without explaining how she has them. I’m sorry but fuck that shit. Leia’s most important message was hope, and this film hasn’t given anyone hope. With TFA’s I sincerely believe that Abrams tried to give us a movie that would give us back the inspiration that the OT and parts of the Prequels had, but again Rian and Kennedy had other goals, lesson learned GIVE THE FANS WHAT THEY WANT AND THINK SMART next time you write a script.",0.963,469

The new uses of the force maybe? they were fine... they didn't bother me as much as the flat story and boring characters. but with all that said, you all can love this movie and see it 10 times in the cinema. personally, I will not see ep 9 in the cinema. #notmystarwars

"You're a bunch of hacks.

If Star Wars The Last Jedi did something, is to finally open my eyes to the level of shilling and disingenuous reviewing after more than a year and a half of following.

I thought you guys were just having fun and being casual, not acting. Shame on you Collider. I will unsubscribe from both channels, this and Schmoes Know. I'd rather watch Red Letter Media's The Nerd Crew who are 100% accurate at making fun of you . I just watched their first episode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sExTt4j69zI and can't stop laughing. 

You guys are EXACTLY like that. Harder to notice on Movie Talk or the other shows, but on Jedi Council... pure comedy about how sold you are. There's no fanboy/girl so blindly devoted as you are. So the best explanation is that you're either being paid or worse. You're cockroaches enjoying the attention of Hollywood elites with the privilege of participating to premieres.",0.9601,176

i haven't heard kristian harloffs' reaction/review for blade runner 2049..,0.0,14
"i think the money this film earned speaks for itself.

The issue here is that everyone who vehemently dislikes this film also has a medium to voice their opinions to the entire world. Whereas the fans who enjoyed it aren't going out of their way to flood message boards and youtube with rants praising the film haha. instead they will most likely ignore the argument bait and just watch the movie again.

So what ends up happening is that all we see are vile, negative videos with lots of childish hate for a film. 

At the end of the day we are under the impression that reactions are 50/50 when the actual number of fans that dislike the film pales in comparison to the number of positive reactions to the film. 

Ive yet to see one valid deteraction or point other than the canto bight scene being out of place. And yeah, it is, but even awkward looking pizza is still pizza, and it still tastes good enough to eat.",-0.0488,182

"lets be honest, this is the 5th or 6th best star wars movie.. not a fan that rian Johnson was directing because I didn't like any of his previous films. I don't like his style and storytelling. i feel bad for all the fans that were let down. i had low standards going in so I'm not bummed. cant wait for jj to finish this thing off strong",-0.5142,74

"you think a family man cares about die hard fan opinions? lol hell no. When I went i saw nothing but families, lines of dads moms and kids, Disney has a money machine here. i expect 5 more star wars movies before these numbers die down. also I found the film very entertaining as did the other people cheering and clapping. the internet will always be unhappy, meh.",-0.7768,77
