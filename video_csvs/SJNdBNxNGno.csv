"You'll need to check your water quality, despite having plants there could still be a build up of nitrates, remember to clean your filter, and check for any big chunks of food or dead fish/plant matter throughout the aquarium. If the problem still persists after a week and shows no sign of improvement or your fish begin to show signs of illness (rubbing/flicking, not eating, white spots, clamped fins etc,) you will need to treat your tank for parasites.",-0.5267,94
