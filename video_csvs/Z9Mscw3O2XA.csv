"Dictator Kim Jung il's limo was a a 1975 Lincoln Continental.  I thought that was very odd, that an Anti Yankee dictador rode in an Iconic American car, instead of a Mercedes Benz 600, like every other dictators. I am sure it was given to him by Jewllywood producers along with some spending money, for his part in playing the controled opposition, in the theater of war.  Jews love to split up Families and Nations.  He is a just another Jewish puppet, like SOUTH Korea.  It's always been divide and conquer.  Now he is being used as an excuse for Americans to surround their forces around China, and more importantly, Russia.",0.7506,126
Holt should just move to north korea if they treat him so well,0.624,13
"I didn't know that the juche tower was modelled after a peacock. By the way, NBC introduced the peacock logo in 1962 while juche tower constructed in 1982. Also, if Trump had his way, North Korea would probably be eliminated (aka fire and fury).",-0.34,52

"Maybe they start out as a confederacy with a committed long term plan toward full unification.

"the NBC logo you see that shows the JUCHE TOWER was created in 1986. NBC used the JUCHE TOWER as their role model. Also the 6 colors are north Korean national colors and north Korean symbolism.
 North Korea and the USA use the same symbols. The Juche TOWER FLAME is called the FLAME OF LIBERTY in north Korea which can be also seen on the statue of liberty too.  US monuments and north Korean monuments and statues are very similiar. Although north Korean monuments like the JUCHE TOWER are larger than for example their counterparts like the Washington monument or Washington statue. North Korean oblisks are also more beautiful...
Also military symbols are almost the same. The north Korean airforce uses the pentagram star in front of a sun.  The star is red or dark. US airforce  national insignia in 2018 also got the same symbol with a dark star in front of sun. Clearly a copy of the north Korean airforce national insignia.",0.9454,177
