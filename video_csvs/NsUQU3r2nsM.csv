"All you salty brown people are only salty because you know it's true, HE GOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE HE'S BLACK. It had nothing to do with his GPA or what he did in high school. Absolutely nothing. They see a black boy and lose their minds trying to get him in so they look diverse and open minded. There are HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of ethnicities who have a better GPA and did more prestigious things before they were 16 who got bumped down because they're not black like this young man. So deny it all you want but this country is DYINGGGGG to give extra hand outs to black people to make them feel special and loved. When in all reality all it does is hurt the blacks. Makes you look inferior and stupid compared to your white counterparts. AND YOU ALWAYS WILL if you don't start taking action yourselves.

It's of course not nice to say these things when these videos come around, but people should keep in mind how affirmative action is not only racist, but fucks over Asians the most, who have scientifically been proven to be the smartest race on the planet with an average IQ of 113 compared to whites 103, Hispanics, 95 and blacks 85.",0.8924,163

All of my nephews have their college degrees, as well as their sister, and they all went to school in Chicago.  They all have wonderful job now, and own their own homes; one's a graphic artist, writer and sculptor; one is an IT engineer; one works for Car Max as some kind of buyer who travels all over the world for Car Max; their sister, after graduating from college joined the Navy as a Commissioned Officer, then moved onto to join the Illinois State Police; she's now a detective specializing in medical fraud.  I can't begin to name my family and friends who also have college degrees, and/or are just do very, very well in these United States of America.  All without Affirmative Action.  Why?  We didn't need it.  Affirmative Action is for people who have very little, and/or grew up in areas where the schools are less than par.  So, while I don't personally know anyone who graduated from Harvard, we still have a lot of very successful Black people in my family and circle of friends.

On the other hand my other friend (Mexican) applied with a 4.2 GPA and a 1400 SAT score was granted admission. So yes being a minority does help with college admissions because a college likes diversity not a school full of Asians Arabians and Caucasians.
