"As a step out from the norm, and I really appreciate this. Well made and shot, for not having a big name for yourself in music making. The collab went well.
As a rap/pop/hop/whatever song, not great. Lost flow a bunch, and you guys didn't have much sync with your styles or themes (not that most pop does, but just because it's pop, doesn't mean it's good). Your voice isn't great for the serious type rap verses; that threw me off hard. lol
I look forward to more branch-out type stuff you post, and also the 50-50 split of likes (at time of writing, 20K up, 20K down)",0.5635,134
