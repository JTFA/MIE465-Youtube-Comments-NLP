I thought Eminem had some bad features,-0.5423,7
"I totally disagree. I think Pop 2 is MUCH more experimental than Number 1 Angel. Number 1 Angel, for me, reads as a present day slightly experimental but also nostalgic (with disco remnants like in the song ""Roll With Me"")  pop party album. Pop 2 is another breed. It is full of very digitalized, computerized, robotic, outer space (""Unlock it""), metal dropping (""Femmebot"") sounds. I think this mixtape was mainly featuring AG Cook's production without really changing very much to fit the Charli XCX mold. You can find live performances of AG Cook playing songs like ""Femmebot"" without Charli XCX's vocals years ago before this came out. So I really think it was mostly AG Cook putting his very avant-garde personal style/ production out there and Charli mainly just interpreted his songs with lyrics. Any interviews I've seen with Charli sort of confirms this as she mentions the mixtape was made by AG sending her the songs while she was traveling and she would go into the studio in LA, London, NYC, all over and just put her vocals over it. They weren't really even physically together throughout the process. So while I think I agree Number 1 Angel was a little more tailored to Charli, Pop 2 highlighted AG's futuristic, nancarrow inspired production with Charli's interpretation of the vocals/ lyrics. That is my take.",0.9759,264

"Learn to cut,  juice and use passion fruit with ease.  Don’t let this unique, tropic fruit daunt you! It’s easy and delicious!
Thought to be native to southern Brazil, passion fruit are named for the bloom of the spectacular passion fruit flower, not for the fruit itself.

It’s believed that Spanish missionaries thought parts of the flower resembled different religious symbols.

If you’ve never worked with it, you may not know how to cut, juice and use passion fruit.  I’m excited to show you because it’s so easy.
hoose passion fruit that feels a bit heavy for its size.

The fruit should look plump, despite any wrinkles in the skin.

Wrinkled skin is okay, in fact it’s great!  It’s usually the sign of a very ripe passion fruit.  You should actually wait to use them until they’re on the wrinkled side.
To let it ripen when its skin is super smooth, set it out at room temperature. As with most fruits, they should not be refrigerated to ripen.

Once they’re ripe, passion fruit can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week or so.

Okay, let’s get to work.  (Even if this one isn’t quite wrinkled yet.)

1. Simply slice the fruit in half.
Some people describe the flavor of passion fruit as the true taste and essence of the tropics. I’d have to agree with this.

In fact, the scent alone send my mind to the tropics.

The pulp of a purple passion fruit is golden yellow and intensely aromatic — the flavor ranges from sweet-tart to very tart.

2. Use a small spoon to scoop the pulp from its skin.
Passion fruit pulp is gelatinous and full of small dark seeds.

3.  Add the pulp to a small bowl and gently heat it to liquefy it a bit — this will make it much easier to strain. 

4. Now you can strain the warmed pulp through a fine sieve to remove the seeds.  If the juice doesn’t seem to be going through, use the back of a spoon to put pressure on the pulp and seeds.
I love every step of this process, especially the the wonderful scent of the fruit seeping into the air around me.

It’s truly amazing, and it begins the minute you cut into the fruit. I think the empty skins of passion fruit are stunning.
This luscious juice can be used in sweet or savory sauces, in salad dressings, as a marinade, in cocktails, cheesecakes, ice cream,  sweet mousses, and more.
It’s also quite common to eat the Passion Fruit seeds.  They can add crunch to salads and are often used as garnish over a recipe that includes the juice.  And some simply eat everything together, right out of the skin, with a spoon.

It’s too tart for me though — I love it mostly in desserts when it’s made sweeter.  (And personally, I’m not a fan of the seeds — but I’m also not a fan of pomegranate seeds so maybe it’s me.)
Passion fruit is now grown in Australia, California, Florida, New Zealand and Hawaii, and other parts of the tropics. Depending on its location, passion fruit are available almost all year.

That was easy, right?  Now you know how to cut, juice and use passion fruit!

ENJOY!                                                                                                                                                                                Thank you to Melissa’s Produce for sending me passion fruit for recipe testing and for Valentine’s Day.",0.9972,695
