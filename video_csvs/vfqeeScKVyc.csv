19 and 15 but it was hard because they all looked fabulous on you and I think small breasts are much more sexy and sofisticated than large ones with extreme plunging necklines and you can really rock those pieces. Thanks for all the time and ideas you deserve all the goodness coming your way and congrats on Ted Baker I will definitely buy a bag from them now Merry Christmas gorgeous!,0.9903,73
