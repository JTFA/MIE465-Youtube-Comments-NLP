"The Nuclear Option: Amid Anti-Trump Hysteria, Obama Treason Exposed
¬†http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/12/19/nuclear-option-amid-anti-trump-hysteria-obama-treason-exposed/  by Charles Hurt             19 Dec 2017
These days, we are living through a real-life international spy 
thriller full of vast conspiracies, lawless rogue government agents, 
unthinkable betrayals all driven by stupendous greed and a blithe 
willingness to lie about absolutely anything.
It could be the latest¬†HBO¬†sensation or a binge-worthy hit on¬†Netflix.
The first major wormhole moment came after a U.S. Border Patrol agent
 was murdered in 2010 and guns at the crime scene were linked to the 
U.S. government.
Conspiracy nuts started talking about how 
the ATF had violated the very federal gun laws the bureau is charged 
with enforcing by knowingly allowing ‚Äústraw purchasers‚Äù to obtain 
weapons that they would later sell to Mexican drug cartels.
We are talking tinfoil-hat crazy conspiracy stuff. Many good people 
dismissed the claims as preposterous, the daffy product of overactive 
imaginations and overstimulated partisanship. Like monsters underneath a
 child‚Äôs bed.
Then we learned every bit of it was honest-to-God‚Äôs truth. Under the 
Obama administration, our federal government was arming some of our most
 savage and destructive enemies ‚Äî purportedly in the name of ‚Äútracking‚Äù 
the bad guys.
Since that startling revelation, similarly appalling betrayals and 
conspiracies have become almost routine. The root causes of each scandal
 range from alarmingly reckless incompetence to treasonous betrayals of 
the American people.
There was the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in 
Benghazi. Rooted in lazy incompetence, the ensuing cover-up became a 
labyrinth of lies and false accusations that led to riots and mayhem 
around the globe.
Then the Democratic Party rigged its own primary to thwart the will of its own voters.
When then-candidate Donald Trump sounded the alarm, Democrats ‚Äî and 
even some Republicans ‚Äî called him a reckless kook and laughed him off.
Of course, stolen insider emails have since proved all of Mr. Trump‚Äôs hunches to be correct.
In fact, it was even worse than he predicted.

Every day now, we learn more and more about how Democrats, 
Republicans and self-serving bureaucrats inside the federal government 
worked to jilt the election out of Mr. Trump‚Äôs hands. Shamelessly, the 
Obama administration used our government‚Äôs most powerful intelligence 
apparatus to spy on his political opponents during the height of a 
presidential campaign.
That these vermin colluders failed has in no way deterred them. They 
remain as committed to undoing the Trump presidency today as they were 
before the election.
But the most sinister twist ‚Äî the most brazen conspiracy caper of all
 ‚Äî in this entire spy novel extravaganza we are now enduring has to be 
the eight-year scheme by the Obama administration to betray the American
 people and hand unbridled power to one of our most ardent and 
determined enemies.
An extraordinary and thorough¬†report¬†by Politico¬†exposes a vast 
left-wing conspiracy at all levels of the Obama administration to 
collude with a terrorist organization in hopes of empowering a nation 
devoted to the death of America.
According to the report, Obama officials pressured federal 
investigators to back off investigations into huge money-laundering, 
weapons and drug trafficking operations by the terrorist group 
Hezbollah. The Obama administration offered this protection even as 
Hezbollah was raking in $1 billion a year and extending its murderous 
anti-American influence far beyond the Middle East.

All in the name of what? Upholding the U.S. Constitution? Fighting the war on terror? Peace in the Middle East?
Not hardly. It was all in the name of placating Iran ‚Äî Hezbollah‚Äôs 
patron nation ‚Äî so that the Obama administration could ink a 
ridiculously lopsided deal on Iran‚Äôs nuclear program. A deal that scored
 Iran hundreds of millions in cash and billions more in sanctions 
relief.
At the very, very, very end of the whole deal, Iran gets to weaponize its nuclear program anyway.
If that is not outright treason, then nothing is.
