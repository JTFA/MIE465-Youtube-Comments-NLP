"But there are tons of trans women who perform in drag shows.  One might argue that before there WAS a trans community, drag was their only outlet for expressing themselves.  They say that imitation is the purest form of flattery.  What about every actor on stage and in movies?  What about Halloween?  Is dressing up as a kitty cat disparaging the feline community?  And how about fashion trends?  They've been ""appropriating"" elements from every ethnicity, every religion, every culture in the world for centuries.  How about butch women?  Are they just making fun of masculinity by refusing to dress in feminine clothing?  What about people who tan too much?  Are they feeding their vanity by stealing the complexion of naturally brown people?  How about Hip Hop music?  There we have an entire music industry built on sampling or ""appropriating"" music from other artists.  To insist that people refrain from borrowing elements from other cultures as if said elements are owned by their originators sounds an awful lot like the phrase ""stick to your own kind"".  As if we must all remain obedient slaves to labels such as race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and ethnicity.",-0.9254,224
