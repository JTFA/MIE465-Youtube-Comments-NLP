"* sigh* 

Every korean family ever.

So here's how my Sunday afternoon goes when it's time to make kimchi. ( we like to make ours at home)

Mince the garlic! Cut the peppers!  Slice the radishes!  Salt the cabbages!  

And after running around the house trying to get everything done. It comes to my ""FAVORITE"" part.

Fermenting.

You basically put the vegetables that are now salted, spiced, and seasoned into large containers and let just sit in the fridge for a month or 2. Just let sit there.. during the duration of Fermenting everything EVERYTHING smells and tasted like kimchi! Apple! Kimchi. rice! Kimchi! UR LEFTOVERS!kimchi! ( I maybe exaggerating this part ) 
But in the end it tastes good !",0.7405,146

Also, it is not good for your body if you eat too much(as I mentioned, there is lots of salt in it), but it is healthier than some...for example...fried...sausage..?

The basics of making it is really just garlic, onion purée, fish sauce, plum vinegar/ extract, pepper flakes, cabbage and rice flour roux.

"You can state your opinion. On the internet you have the right of free speech but some people shouldn't feel like they're the only one on the internet or in the world. You can compare it to a vegan saying that he or she is a vegan. It has nothing to do with the video and the content of the video. It has zero relevance. So my tip is: think twice before commenting and always be aware that not everyone is in your fandom. If mentioning your favourite boy band is the only thing you do on the internet, reevaluate yourself.",-0.1318,110

They're disgusting fat fucks who oversexualise celebrities and pretend to be their wives and or husbands. They write smut about them and roleplay as them.

"but i feel if exo or twice or svt made a video about making kimchi and their fans commented here, no one would care. there are a lot of armys worldwide. all of them might have thought of bts, and like the use of a comment section, they simply commented what they thought. but i guess now bc i commented this im just immature, all armys are immature, and bts' fandom is the only fandom that sucks. most ppl who commented were commenting with a light heart. nothing else! if this was a video about exo, i would understand. but armys arent here to steal the spotlight away from kimchi! i feel if people think this is immature and armys are just plain rude, theyre stereotyping bts fans. ""all bts fans are rude and immature"" ""ew dont bring bts into this!! its a vid about korean food how dare u"" is like saying ""all tøp fans are emo 13 year olds"" im not saying that armys are not rude, but im saying not ALL armys are rude. so stop the negative comments on people who just want to support their faves",-0.9453,218

"people be getting mad about ARMYS everywhere. yeah I know many could be annoying but let them be, they just love their idols so much so why not, right? it's the comment section afterall. it's not like ARMYs here talking bad about other k-idols. commenting ""jungkook taught me this"", ""here because of bts"", ""BTS BROUGHT ME HERE"" will not hurt you at all. if other groups like svt or twice be commented about here people would not give a damn, but because BTS is practically worldwide, people be hating on the ARMYS comment? Some ARMYs could be really goddamn cringy but let them be. you should just love bts the way you want to, if you want to boast anout them, sure but just respect other k-idols or any idols. if you don't like the comment, there's a dislike button. no need to blame BTS for the annoying ARMYS. BTS being famous is actually a great thing for Koreans because BTS helped to bring Korean culture to MORE TO THE FRONT, the world has been sleeping them. love yourself,  respect people's comment. if you don't like, ignore. no need to bash on ARMYS and especially BTS . ♡♡♡♡",0.8088,231
