And you showed the numbers, Italy is in debt. A lot of debt. What good do you think the Euro and the EU are doing for Italy? Do you think it is worth it staying in this cess pit?
What about illegal immigrants? Why defend them? They are illegal. Immigration is not a universal right, it is a contract. You have to follow the rules, you need to adapt and deserve it. So by all means, let's deport the illegal immigrants. I'm all in favour. I'm an immigrant myself, and I follow the rules, I don't go messing about and telling people from my host country how to do stuff and I don't demand things I don't have merit to get. That's called respect.
Salvini is indeed not someone you'd like to take control, but that's what the parliament is for. We can't afford Renzi and the PD. Salvini is the less worse option.
Don't tell me the USA is more democratic. You elected another idiot. And what was the alternative? That corrupt hag Clinton. Would you really back that woman after all the scandals and corruption?
So these guys resemble fascists because they want to preserve what they love about Italy, because they want to remove privileges from certain people in Italian society and they want to regulate people. That wouldn't be necessary if the left were doing their job. One has to be tolerant, yes, but don't take a tolerant people for a stupid people.

I can agree Italy is experiencing a sad political era but only people that grew up there can actually understand and talk about the nuances of Italian politics. The Anglo Saxon way of life is diametrically opposite  to ours - and definitely not a better one- that’s why I am reluctant to accept criticism from this British comedian. During our 65 governments we built a strong public social infrastructure where primary education is stronger and better then most other countries as well as a great public ( and free) health care system. Italians are compassionate people, yes at times we are loud and we say inappropriate things but we show with our actions that we care and respect for other races and other nations.  We came as a first aid to so many immigrants in the past years, we tried to accommodate them, and gave them the few resources  we could afford. We stand strong and proud and defend  our values such as the love for our families and friends, we respect the elders (unlike many other nations) - we enjoy one of the longest life spans on earth preceded only by Japan , we care about our food traditions and our produce which is served on 100 of thousands of restaurants all over the world ( you welcome) . We are one of the richest nations when it comes to archeological and historical sites, not so easy to maintain also not easy to compete and keep up with emerging cities when most of our cities are 3000 years old. Italians are not so materialistic and can still have a great life without lots of money, because our lands are beautiful and life can be easy, Most of Italians are decent people happily living in a struggling country with many problems. Is almost like shooting on an ambulance to talk about Italy without an italian POV to counter on this opinions, and this is defenetly not helping us. I wonder if there is a new post brexit class of journalist trying to shame other countries to help the UK reach better agreements and deals with the Us and the EU  I would look into Britain instead of talking sh*it about  the Italians. You guys still have a silly monarchy and a classist House of Lords ( bloodline driven) English people voted for Brexit choosing to isolate themselves from the rest of Europe.

"They come in from Melila and cross the the ocean, it's been happening for years. Anywhere they settle becomes a slum. These are the facts on the ground I see, the news has denied there's a problem while chastising the government for dealing with the problem and the government also denies it's a problem while being chastised for how it deals with the problem.

Can you see how it gets a bit old after 10-15 years of seeing a problem that everyone says doesn't exist get worse?
