This is the problem with women in the police force and on the front lines in the military. They are just built to nurture not to have extreme power and strength at the instance it is needed. 

Anyway we live in a society now that doesn't know what a man is and what a woman is so who cares right.",0.9533,89

"There are many fat, weak men police officers but people usually don’t discuss how they can knock out them with one punch. Honestly, I don’t think that there are enough fit men wanting to become police officers in the world to fill the police force. On top of that, you shouldn’t judge her strength based on what she looks like. Even if you were going to, you can’t base it off of a video of her not using any strength, as well as being fully clothed. As for the point that she doesn’t have her guard up, I think she is expressing the correct amount of suspicion, as, to my understanding, she is dealing with someone who may not be completely mentally stable. I don’t think her holding a gun to his head while he talks about shitposting would be needed. Thanks for reading my TED Talk.",0.9737,175

"Well to begin, two wrongs don't make a right, an unqualified male does not make an unqualified female acceptable, and you don't see people saying it about males because it's both not a common thing to say and because those fat weak police officers don't start with a biological disadvantage to other men, women on average have 40% less upper body strength than males, I disagree with the idea that there aren't enough fit men to become police officers, the problem is that, like my local department, it matters about who you know more than your qualifications, they're also not required to pass a fitness test past when they are hired, if they are required to pass a fitness test at all, you say i can't judge her strength based on what she looks like, this isn't a movie, she is morbidly obese, she has a double chin, i don't need to see her naked, her fat is practically spilling out of her uniform, this is concrete evidence that she does not exercise and, she is a woman who again on average, have 40% less upper body strength and she is not the exception.",0.8125,216
