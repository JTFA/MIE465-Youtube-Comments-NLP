Bob Chillison if it‚Äôs an anthology series it should center KJ and the cases she takes on.

But if it‚Äôs going to be entirely new hopefully it won‚Äôt be another white cop killing black kid story. That shits so sad. Also the ending to Seven Seconds was so real.

This is absolutely 100% unnecessary to this series, including this gay nonsense does absolutely nothing for the show to help increase its value instead all it does is reveal the ever prevailing compromise of Hollywood and television and politics bending down to the Abomination gods of the 21st Century..... this is an absolute shame....
