"Yeah. I have no idea why they haven't gotten rid of the girl, she only presents garbage moves, not really that funny, and it's not like her transitions are super clean. Yas is fine for classical or even rapid, but when it gets this fast he doesn't speed up at all really.

They should replace the girl with someone less knowledgeable, but who has very strong hosting skills and can keep the broadcast on track. Alternatively, they could just have 2 analysts and not do the the thing where they have 2 people fucking off and then throw it over to an analyst.",0.8036,114
