There¬¥s a few things that could've been better, but we know you did this on a budget. You should look forward to improve the lip sync, and the constant background music during dialogues, which is a bit annoying. 
Everything else is really great, photography, visual effects, editing, make up, costumes. You should be very proud of this.

"Finally I got time to watch this movie! And to be honest, it‚Äôs amazing! I love the visuals and the whole storyline where Grisha guides through the whole story and we know we are not done there yet. Huge respect to the makers! I cannot wait for more movies to come!",0.9576,59
"First of all,I enjoyed the film and I truly admire the people who did it,I cant even imagine how much hard work,money and time it takes to make such a thing. Thank you. 

Although I dont want to critize it too much, because as a whole its really good,I would like to say something to the plot and acting. Unlike other people I didnt find the dubbing too disturbing,of course it could be better, but I was able to quite easily ignore the slight shift of sound/it sometimes happens also in normal shows with dubbing../,also the visual effects were great. But there were a few things that bothered me and that werent too hard to fix.

Number one is acting. I think that Grisha should have been more without emotions when she took the veritaserum, thats how it was described in the books/Goblet of Fire when Dumbledore interrogated Crouch Jr./ or at least she should have acted as if someone was forcing her to answer. There she was just quite colorfully discribing the story as if chatting with a friend over lunch. Maybe you wanted it like that because it wasnt really her,but I found it disturbing. And I didnt really catch why Tom told them all of that,was it beacuse he was somehow in the girls body at the time and veritaserum worked for her,not for him?

Second thing is Voldemorts acting. I liked how the actor captured his ambions and his dark side, but I dont think he showed this so much when he was younger..it is said that he was rather charming and thats also how he persuaded Hepzibah to show him the cup/or better said why she liked him so much that she showed it/ I would like it better if he smiled more/ I dont mean real smiles,just like little or forced or maybe dark ones,that would try to charm others /. Remember not even Dumbledore was certain that he was bad and all others thought that he was just great.At first they didnt see his dark side at all.
And the end was a little bit confusing, you could sum it up more-e.g. show Grishas dead,not just her bones. Also as others have already said eagle,not raven and Tom really couldnt remember his mother/she died when he was born/. 

But as I said as a whole I really liked it and I would like to thank everybody who helped with it for sharing it  for free!
/also all of the ""mistakes"" are just my own opinion!/",0.9947,494

If Voldemort impersonated Grisha, where was the real Grisha?

Because from minute 20 till the end, I found myself physically agitated with how out of sync the voice overs were with what was happening on the screen.

Beyond that, really excellent and interesting take on a voldermort origin.",0.8719,110
