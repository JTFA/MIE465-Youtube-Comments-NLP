In season 1 Episode 5 “Meeseeks and destroy” at the end of the episode Jerry, and Beth are talking about how she’s not going on the trip, and they don’t have a perfect marriage. Beth says something I never noticed before. Beth- “when we were in that freezer, the meeseeks sound some of the guys I went to high school with, willing to say anything to complete their task.” Jerry - “ was I one of those guys?” Beth- “The difference is, you didn’t disappear afterwards.” Jerry- “ well I gotcha pregnant” Beth- “ YEAHHHHH UHH” lol did no one else catch this? Or am I late to the party? Based off her answer, and reaction. She either doesn’t know who summers dad is, or she does know, and it’s not Jerry. Lol either way this has peaked my interest lol.",0.9123,198
