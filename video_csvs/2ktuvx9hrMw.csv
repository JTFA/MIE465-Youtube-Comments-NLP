Disney knows this is going to be controversial so they have not explicitly publicized this even on the IMDB page.

I think that's when it's supposed to be released in movie theaters. Also I am looking forward to watching this when it comes out to the movie theaters. For the past couple of years now maybe more than that give or take. Disney has been doing a fantastic and amazing plus wonderful job at bringing they're movies to life. Like seriously look at Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland, and now the Nutcracker and the four realms. All these movies turned out fantastically awesome love how Disney is bringing all their movies out as the live-action movie. So far I have all of Disney's live-action movies on Blu-ray disc. After Disney releases The Nutcracker and the four rounds to the movie theaters and when it comes out on Blu-ray disc I will add that to my collection as well.",0.9894,188
