"But those movies have been made, lol. Not the same setting or context, but there are years of media, dedicated to that concept. The only difference is that black people were never systematically above whites as far as social class and influence goes. As far as racial lines go, white people never had anything objectively to fear about black people. Those films were created with the intent of pushing concepts of purity as well as keeping fear alive that the people that were once slaves, still aren't people.

On the other hand Get-out plays on fears of black people. A large chunk of black culture is directly tied to white culture in the sense, that white fear is what created the black culture we have today. The communities that were driven into isolation, the very public violence and executions without trial and so on are where cultural black fears come from.

To say get-out is low-key racist, is to pretty much ignore the entire history of race relations and media in America. I'd say in 2018, a lot of those issues black people faced are gone. However, majority of us who were born before the 2000s, have pretty close interactions with the culture of fear. and that's who this movie is targeting most.",-0.9395,236

Yes, Jordan Peele, like you, I too, am racist. We can bond over that, and you can say you have a white friend! That way we both get what we want! If your black friends start saying you're racist just tell them ""It's cool, we've got this guy Not Sure.."" and they'll TOTALLY get it. I happen to speak for all white people. It's like a black guys hood pass. Except, not the ones that white people also have in government housing.

Tell me, what's louder? Actions or words? Where does comedy begin? If I say I killed someone did someone die? If I killed someone and say I didn't am I a murderer?

"It's different though. Majority of major western media has been made by white creators, who's audience was other white people.

It's because the lens was narrow and designed for like-minded people. It's the same reason why ""white history month"" or ""white entertainment television"" doesn't exist. By default, majority of western media is white-centric. It's just how it is.

Whereas Get-Out is taking heavy social cues, fears and concepts from the lens of a black man and the intended audience are people with similar fears. And by saying it's for black people, it doesn't mean ""only black people can watch it."" It just means, the target demographic who will get the most impact from the film is black people.",-0.9393,183

And than rather than discussing those differences and finding solutions to fixing them, we have over a century's worth of ""get over it"" or ""it doesn't matter"" talk.

And that's what makes this film so resonating, especially with black(but not limited to) audiences. It's highlighting key cultural fears that go unaddressed.  It's playing off of deep rooted fears and unspoken truths. The movie takes it to ridiculous levels(Cause its a horror of-course) but the themes of the film can only be successful in an environment where they exist.

"That's the secret, my friend. The division was already there. Talking about race and talking about the fears that have been created over the last century is how we unite. This movie is an upfront discussion on some pretty major cultural fears in the black community.

If we keep ignoring our differences, rather than talking about them and healing wounds, THATS how we continue to be divided. That's how families split, that's how divorces end and thats how communities separate. So let's talk about race, lets talk about our fears and lets listen to one another. It's gonna be uncomfortable. But healing social wounds is never comfortable for anyone.

This movie is purely an example of a fear that's existed sine the 60s and has had no major narrative outlet, like it has  with this movie. And if your take is ""It's dividing us"" rather than ""it's highlighting things that have already been dividing us for years"" you're either missing the point, or your concept of unity means strict comfort for you.",-0.8625,194

Originality as a pure concept is pretty impossible. I'd think you'd have a hard time finding a film made post 1970s that isn't a re-hash of something pre-existing. And even before that, films were rehashing books.

But that being said, a lot of the originality of this movie comes from the social commentary and cues. Stepford Wives' social commentary is of an entirely different breed and that's what separate the two.",0.6712,126
"This ""rotten tomatoes"" must be populated by black people. In fact, bill burr phrased it well some time ago when he said: ""There's no 'brothers' when it comes to white people. We are just complete individuals. We don't care about each other. He's not my brother; my brother lives in Ohio... I don't know that guy."". So white people who are guilt ridden for being white give this movie good ratings because they get off when being shamed and black people enjoy their victim role as in ""yes, that is exactly how the white man treats us"". Everyone wins. Therefore 99 per cent. I am german and I am neither ashamed of being white nor of being german.

Whether it's as a writer,  a comedian, or plain ole human being, this man has already greatly contributed to humanity as a whole as well as the national discourse on racism.",0.9741,101
