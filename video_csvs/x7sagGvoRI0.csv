"As a telecommunication engineer I should say that in order to get 256 qam, you should have nearly perfect signal quality which means nearly zero loaded base station in your area + phones that support 256 qam is I think less than 2 percent of the total phones in the market currently. So all these discussions is hypothetical for this current period.
