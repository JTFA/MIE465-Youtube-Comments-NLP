"Actor round tables are always painful‚Äìyou see them being so careful with their expressions because they're all professional observers, but no matter how many awards each has, they'll always be insecure and pitted against each other. I recognize these as mansplaining faces. The other women listen politely, but with different levels of detachment as Kate cannot shut up about Woody's supposed ""effervescence"" (please) and how ""exhilarating"" it is to be Kate Winslet within the magical world of cinema. None of this is as charming as Kate wants it to be because she's already peaked, and so has groady old troll Woody Allen. Her pretentious blather isn't helping anything.",0.4725,125
"After Mia learned of the affair, she admittedly beat Soon-Yi,¬†reportedly¬†cut up her clothes, and banished her from her home. By the end of 1992, it was¬†revealedthat ""Soon-Yi is out of the family."" Andr√© said of his daughter, ""She does not exist."" Her parents stopped paying her college tuition at Drew, where she was in her sophomore year. Woody then picked up the tab. In the summers home from college she lived separately from Woody in her own apartment on the Upper East Side.
At the time of the scandal, many Farrow-Previn insiders and family members speaking to the press presented Soon-Yi as mentally slow, incapable of making decisions for herself, and therefore a helpless victim who was groomed and raped by Woody. Her aunt, Tisa Farrow, would refer to her as having ""a double-digit IQ. It's not like she's a drooling idiot, but she's very naive and very immature."" One of the Farrow family tutors told¬†Vanity Fair¬†that Soon-Yi was learning disabled and ""very socially inappropriate,"" and ""has trouble processing information, trouble understanding language on an inferential level [and] misinterprets situations.""

Soon-Yi resented the implications, which she felt robbed her of any agency. In an interview with¬†Newsweek¬†she said:

""I'm not a retarded little underage flower who was raped, molested and spoiled by some evil stepfather‚Äînot by a long shot. I'm a psychology major at college who fell for a man who happens to be the ex-boyfriend of Mia.""

The family said they didn't believe the statement came from Soon-Yi, saying she ""doesn't know half those words, what they mean."" Despite the questions about her mental capacity Soon-Yi regularly made the dean's list at Drew. She graduated in 1995 and went on to get her masters in special education from Columbia University in 1998. She taught fourth grade at Spence, an exclusive private school in Manhattan.

Soon Yi brother Moses:
""My mother drummed it into me to hate my father‚Ä¶I see now that this was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi."" Moses, who was a teenager at the time, was there on the day that the incident of Dylan's molestation was alleged to have taken place, but says, ""Of course Woody did not molest my sister."" Moses' most recent comments are¬†consistent¬†with what he privately told his nanny of seven years back in 1992. He also charged that Mia would go into ""unbridled rages"" when angered, and that she often would hit him.",-0.9935,490

"All entertainers, particularly actresses, whine that they want to be known for their minds but these are their responses. Kate Winslet is the prime example on why I never listen to any interview of any entertainer. And I'm not surprised that the majority of entertainers provide stupid responses since many of them are high school or university drop outs therefore, they are uneducated. Also, acting school doesn't count since what you are working on are ensuring that your limbs are working for the camera and stage hence, not challenging your mind and therefore, not a proper education.",-0.3827,107
"And as a side note, in this case I suppose they don't feel it would be appropriate to interrupt Kate and start pointing fingers and making biased comments on a case which to this day shows so many inconsistencies and leaves so many questions unanswered.

But this is an entirely different situation and I think that is one of the main reasons why A-list actors continue to star in Woody Allen's movies.",-0.3415,99

What you and others are doing my friend is attaching meaning to her behaviour based upon your own internalised beliefs.

"Have to say I respectfully disagree. (And sorry in advance, this is gonna be a bit long). Sure, you can appreciate someone's art, but that's different from sitting there in a very public setting and praising someone who, at the very least, has done some very questionable things. Same goes for Roman Polanski, whose case is even more extreme. He's an admitted child-rapist who is hiding from justice in another country, and yet Winslet, among others, has been more than happy to work with him and he even got a standing ovation at the Oscars that one time. So yes, you can admire someone's work, but being a great artist does not excuse the kind of deplorable behavior we're talking about, and first and foremost, that behavior should be absolutely condemned. 

I think the hypocrisy and double-standards are quite evident here too: everyone is now speaking against Harvey Weinstein (as they should) and he's been completely shunned from the community (as he should be) for his atrocious behavior. How come the same standard does not apply to everyone? How come Woody and Polanski and co. get to continue to work, receive awards, etc? Just because they make good films does not mean they should be celebrated. If someone is a horrible person (as is quite clearly the case with, say, Polanski), I could not care less how great of an artist they are, and I don't think the person and the artist should be treated as completely different entities. You don't get to escape responsibility for your actions just cause you are good at film-making.",0.9921,306

The actual fact is we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in Robbie head, we don‚Äôt know what she was thinking at this specific moment and we also don‚Äôt know what Hollywood secrets and perverse abuses of power she is privy too. Hypothetically, she and potentially every other actresses on those couches could have known about Weinstein, and they said nothing about it, yet they get heralded as hero‚Äôs for looking a little more passive when Winslet talked about Allen? I think it‚Äôs unfair that Winslet will be vilified whilst the others here who are potentially complicit in the abuses within the movie industry get heralded up to hero status.

There's literally no hope of legal justice in this situation one way or the other so we can each take everything into consideration and use our own judgement thank you very much. I believe the great Woody Allen groomed a little girl over a period of time and raped her when she was 7. This was her story at 7 and 20 years later nothing has changed. I believe a lot of people are either in denial or too scared to give a shit. That's what I believe.,0.0258,93

"Why are you fuckers voting this down? That was an amazing and personal description of what she went through. Oh, right, it's because Woody Allen has allegedly abused his daughter. 

Here's the thing, he was never legally accused of anything. If you do your own research, you will also find out that there were inconsistencies in Dyllan Farrow's statements, as reported by the NY Times back then - http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html

One of Mia's sons also said that she coached her kids to act against Allen and so did one of Woody's ex-girlfriends.

"Why is everyone giving Kate hate? She isn't praising Woody Allen for his crimes or whatever he may or may not have done in the past, she's praising his work. No matter what he may or may not have done, there is no denying the fact that he is a talented writer. She received a script and worked with him; that doesn't mean she supports anything he did. Praising someone for their talent and praising them AS a person are two completely different things, for all we know she could've been weary around him. He wasn't proven guilty for his crimes, so she worked with him and is professional at what she does. She hasn't mentioned anything about the accusations made against him, and - from what we know - doesn't have dinner at his house, she hasn't actually done anything wrong  here: she was being professional. You have to be professional with things like this, and when opportunity knocks, open the door. He could be a really bad person, but look at the accusations made against Johnny Depp - yes his aren't as extreme as Woody's - he was accused of beating his wife, however that doesn't stop people from working with him as he is a talented actor, despite things in real life: Kate worked with him too.

Just because Kate worked with Woody doesn't mean she had to like him.. again she was being professional and played a character she knew she was right for. What has she actually done wrong here?",-0.5328,281

"people are giving the other actresses here way too much credit. it's fun as a meme to pretend they were very visibly disgusted, but the fact is, they weren't. unless someone called kate out at a later part of this interview that has yet to be released, no one spoke up or called kate out. no one even visibly deigned to roll their eyes or show any explicit form of disagreement. all you see here is a bunch of hypocritical actresses smiling and laughing at the right times, playing their part. if they're uncomfortable, they're uncomfortable with the optics of the situation-- not uncomfortable because it is wrong, since they didn't care enough to actually do or say the right thing. i'm disappointed, especially with jessica chastain, who has made herself out to be such a huge advocate...but ultimately not surprised

hoping there's more to this interview to indicate that at least someone called her out, but i'm not getting my hopes up
