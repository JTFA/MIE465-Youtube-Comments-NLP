Just joking lol. The reason is I personally think is some people immediately assume the worst of things; they don't try to understand new movements in the arts or in pop culture and immediately resort to being hostile towards it. It's why parents often hate their kids' music, they don't understand why it appeals to them and it is foreign to what they knew growing up. It scares them to see their kids listening to it, as they see it as a sort of threat to their children that they can't control.

"China’s reason for doing this is much more insidious than it seems.

Rap’s a form of social dissent. Rappers voice their desire for change in society through their songs. It’s practically the origin of the art form.

China’s rappers were doing something similar. Using their platform to call for positive, progressive change in the government and the country as a whole. 

This law is basically China’s authoritarian state silencing those voices to maintain complete control over the nation. 

Honestly kind of disappointed you didn’t point this out, Melon. I feel like it’s an insight that has to be fleshed out more, because people are dismissing the law’s very real danger by minimizing the rap culture in China as appropriation and shallow, when it’s truly much more crucial than that.",0.7522,160

Chinese all mind set is still very much conservative and protective culturally. They(Chinese hip pop singers) should've known better. 
We all agree that HH culture contains something......horrible...
And guess what？they served the public the first dish with pretty much the worst！！！
Not only did some of them rapped about drugs, sex and crimes, one of them (PGONE) even slept with his friend's wife who is also a celebrity in China, causing quite a scene nationwide.
And then he blamed that he was hugely affected by black music and culture blablabla.
I mean WTF ！！！
The result is plain and simple.
What a shame and pity. It's sad to see some really talented rappers, such as GAI, took the collateral damage.
I'm not a hip-pop fan, I just feel sad that it showed such a promising future and then died out so vastly fast.

"Hey Anthony, I’ve got a lot of insight here since I’m an American student in a chinese public high school. In essence, these guys are screwed. You can post music and photos on social media and streaming services that are technically “immoral” or anti party, but it’ll get taken down in a matter of days, followed by a blacklist and diminishing of sesame credit (which is a social media Facebook style game where you get points by being loyal to the government, I’m not making this up). They just keep getting taken down, and now besides a literal underground audience in local music settings, there is no longer a way that pro counter culture artists can get any public attention. There’s no mass execution or violent crackdown, instead the party is just trying to force the anti government sentiment media to be so non profitable that there is no possibility of making a career out of it. Furthermore there is a surveillance problem, and since there is no private property, any anti status quo rhetoric on stage is considered a public protest, which is a forbidden act. I live specifically in Sichuan, the heart of rapping in china since the Sichuan dialect is the nation wide lingua Franca of hip hop, with the capital of the province, Chengdu, turning into a nationwide hip hop Mecca. The kids here, especially in the Chengdu area are heartbroken. I know students who were too poor to go to a good school and to be able to prepare for the brutal exam system which gets kids into college, they were relying on rapping and free styling (which they were very very talented at) for their future, and being told that they will never get celebrity status or even local fame due to surveillance and the roadblocks is like a knife in the heart for them. The majority of people see no problem with this, since more and more loyalty to the party is becoming the status quo for normal teenagers. The feeling I get from living here is that slowly any opposition and counter culture will just starve from forced neglect and censorship :/",-0.9721,405

I believe the American people have a little more of a backbone then the Chinese when it comes to this issue. (We also have the privilege of not living through the cultural revolution China had) Their are plenty of things that all governments around the world do that are not in the best interest of the people. Freedom of speech is attacked here in America as well.(PC culture) Our freedom of privacy is also attacked. If it's not been apparent before it should be now the government is not and has never been your friend. All the problems that they have solutions to they caused. I would also like to say that China started out as a Republic and it has it's own constitution and bill of rights. They did not start out so different from us.",0.8444,192

"The Chinese media has a way of taking popular things and toning them down for mass entertainment, and hip-hop was no exception, what's different is that hip hop in itself is not very viewer friendly, or government friendly for that matter and these exposure has given them some window to speak out their not-so-fun vulgar things. Both the censoring side and the censoree side are both quite deplorable in this case, people don't like SARPPFT for getting in the way of enjoying subcultures, and some of these rappers are also rich kids who do nothing but spit dirty drug related nonsense on a mike.",0.2311,111
"The US gives rappers too much freedom. What 's the point of promoting drug use, belittling women, and bragging about being street thug ?  I think those Chinese rappers are over punished but they should not learn everything from the US and have the same behavior. Unlike the US, our Chinese care about intellectual stuff. We do expect something deep and smart from lyrics not just fucking or smoking.",0.9398,77

"found your channel just yesterday then saw this… hip hop in china just got big on account of the reality show recently came out which mimicked the exact same one in korea as they always did. all of a sudden everyone became hip hop fan, some ethnic chinese hip hop artists like edison chen and mc jin said that its all about the entertainment, this is not real hip hop. this whole thing was kicked up by one of the champions(they had double champions), pg one's lyric in his latest work, in which contains explicit content including sex, drugs, etc. basically this piece of work in particular enraged a group of people, either because they cant except the fact that an underground rapper is getting so successful in such a seemingly easy way, or they are just conservative in general. normally government disregards public opinion, but maybe it is againt the core value of the party this time, they first banned pg one, then the other champion ""gai"", then the hip hop culture in general. there were some rebel voices againt this, but like i said, nothing is gonna change if the government disapprove it. to this point, people are pretty numb about this kind of stuff, theres always just some discontent on the internet, protests or any form of equally radical actions are never practiced due to the conditions of china. not only hip hop, tons of internet celebrities, and all sorts of ""sensitive"" stuff are banned as well.",0.9258,285
