"I believe that she was the best on the show, but I think a different song would have been better for her vocal range. Another example would be Christina Aguilera trying to sing Whitney Houston songs, they were just really bad for her vocal range. It's hard to match the original though, and she looks stunning.

John Baldino I was trying to figure it out as well but I looked on Twitter and there was nothing and there’s really no hate comments on here towards her so I’m not sure where Adam was seeing these comments since they were probably on a social media platform unless they removed the comments cause they might’ve been too offensive since Adam had the guts to waste time and say something on the air about it when there were hate comments about some other of the contestants too but yeah I wonder what was said about Keisha cause I don’t know what Adam was talking about. And I thought it was very strange how the crowd erupted after Adam said that cause I was like when does the crowd ever erupt like that to what Adam just said.,-0.9612,148
