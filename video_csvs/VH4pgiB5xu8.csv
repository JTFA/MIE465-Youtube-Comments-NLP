"Honestly Dan's little bit of advice for writing a paper has been really valuable to me and has dramatically reduced my procrastination because I don't feel so overwhelmed and it's so helpful.

"Just gotta say. Never NEVER NEEEEVER feel bad about taking anti-depressants!! No more then you would feel about wearing glasses! It's called a disease for a bloody reason! If you need them, PLEASE never feel like you're obligated to ""stop"" one day!!

That being said, FFS do try and take care of yourself when you can!! The base treatment for mood disorders is a regular sleep schedule, don't forget to eat well and exercise ect. ect. 

It can usually bring most folk from ""coping with it"" (including anti-depressants.) to ""actually doing well"" if you can find the energy to manage it. (Which I knooooow can be massively fucking hard. Sometime you can't. I know. Keep fighting. Shit can change at the drop of a dime.)",-0.8589,156
