"+WesIsaLeo Congrats for passing up the OP as the most clueless person on this thread.

The stats dont lie, name a player with more than 15 goals right now that people hear less about and know nothing about, more than Wood?

And yeah, fastest. Didnt say there arent other fast players, but his breakaway speed is the best and it has created a ton of his goals. I guess that compared with being 22 years old playing his first full NHL season doesnt impress you.

You probably never heard of him prior to last night anyways so why Im even responding you about it beats me.",0.8517,117

It doesn't matter if someone got injured. Hitting from behind and leaving your feet can paralyze a player. These types of hits are bad for the game and the chance of injury is too high to not suspend someone for 5 games. If a person is injured they should get 8+ games for it. I don't know if for a first offender making it as long as the injury is appropriate. You can punish and teach a lesson. Hockey is a game played at immense speed and sometimes you don't even realize you're going to hit the numbers. That's why repeat offenders should definitely get severe suspensions but I think the first time needs to be harsh but not too harsh,-0.9473,129

What video are you watching? Wood is up in the air when he clobbers Namestnikov. Was gravity suspended at that moment?

Past stupid rulings should not mean future ones will likewise be lenient. The problem is w/ the pinheads handing out what should be stiff punishments. First-time? So what...pay now and learn a damned lesson. >(",-0.8216,89

You're taught the first day you lace up skates and get on the ice to keep your head up. Even down in Tampa where I grew up and started playing at age 7 the same year the Lightning played their first year. If you have your head down you can't be hit? That's stupid and would be heavily exploited. You obviously have never played a single game,-0.2023,71

"hockeycub19 , exactly. Running at a guy. Mid ice with a head down another classic type. Why try and kill a guy? It will happen we keep this up. Ya guys will bump in the boards.

yeah because someone who has no suspension history should get 10 games when Marchand who has a big history throws an intentional elbow to the side of someones head and that player is now pretty much done for the season and Marchand got an all star appearance and 5 whole games to add to his other many suspensions,0.4939,58
