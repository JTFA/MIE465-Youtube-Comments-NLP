"People can die from car accidents while paying full attention to the road or by being under the influence of a drug.

Obviously a baby can die from many other things while sleeping alone in a bassinet but that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that co-sleeping is dangerous for several reasons. And yes, there is a link between a higher risk of suffocation AND SIDS with co-sleeping. Y'all are fucking retarded. Have fun killing your babies.",-0.985,113

"draingang co sleeping doesn’t kill a baby. Suffocation does. What you’re referring to is SIDS. Which by the way, a baby can die from SIDS in their bassinet/crib, sleeping alone as well. If she feels comfortable co sleeping with her daughter that’s up to mama to decide, and you to keep your mouth closed on how she should parent. The most annoying thing about being a mother, is someone giving you their unwanted advice. If you choose not to co sleep, good for you. Some people choose not to vaccinate their kids, and I’m sure you wouldn’t want someone telling you how you are killing your child by vaccinating. She claims she’s a light sleeper, which I can confirm, when your child is sleeping next to you in a bassinet, every noise or move they make, Wakes you up.",-0.8221,172
