"As an european, the fact that you have to drive a car to commute by train is basically eldritch horror level of incomprehensible. I mean, public trasport is there so you DON'T HAVE TO use private transport. One form of public transport should synergise with the next, so you take a bus/tram/metro to a train station.

In other words, if you have a car, you drive. If you use public transport you don't drive. Driving AND using public transport defeats the point of either. That's how it works in parts of the world that make sense.",-0.7184,112

We complain about environmental, infrastructure, and other population-density problems but yet still we do little to prevent or reverse them. So it can't be that bad of a problem.

"I think it's just the time, really. If you're spending two or more hours a day - unpaid - just to get to your job and relinquish even more of your life, it starts to feel like there's no room left to just live.

I'm in Denver now, via New Jersey, and my trip into school and work is twenty minutes on RTD including walking. I wouldn't trade it for NY or London unless I knew I could afford to live downtown.

Really I think it speaks, like all these problems people have with cities, to housing affordability and the constant disconnect between supply and demand. Hopefully there'll come a point when we start to have an expectation of larger companies to develop housing for their workforce, or our wider planning begins to move toward a more form-based model. Most of the world lives in cities, and if their populations were within walking/biking/regular bus distance of their jobs we'd solve a whole lot of problems, and probably drive a helluva lot of growth.",0.5261,238

My friends were pretty pissed when I told them why I was leaving them (plus, it was pretty last minute- 1 week into the year I rode my bike into town and saw this school and was like 'that's way closer' and literally went in right there and filled in the paperwork, took in my leaving forms to my [old] school the next day and told everyone it was my last day haha).",0.9442,190

"It may be that because of my age and knowing a lot of veterans and a lot of them paid the ultimate price for the  freedoms all of us end up taking for granted, but I don't remember what part said that eventually it will be unlawful to live in a rural area, or that cars are okay, as long as you don't own one,  and take the autonomous one when we allow you to. When did it become , and why is it becoming okay for the government to eliminate what 98% of US citizens say is there first choice for transportation, be it work or leisure? Please, other than repost what someone else says, research a bit. The US has the lowest carbon emissions on the planet, and the stats they quote about transportation being the biggest offender is true, kind of. Cars are responsible for 3% . But , no that is not the total, transportation is also made up of planes, trains , and ships. One cargo ship is equivalent to fifty million cars. Just one. I won't even get into how bad the mines are.  And, to top it off, they don't like to talk about the amount of emissions and environmental damage , and how it makes a large amount more than a normal car, that is created building these cars we can't drive. Wonder why that is? Gee, wonder why they would also like to remove the right for US citizens to be able to own a firearm as well? Why would any government want to make an environment, where only the criminals have weapons, and to go anywhere, you have to use a cars they send to your house and there by knowing exactly when you go, where you go, who you are with, what you say and do, etc. And , you can live in some stack em and pack em,  high rise, $2000/month loft, or go to an education camp, or worse. But, wait, refugees get to live there free, so that's cool. I suppose to say otherwise would be racist, right. Everyone is absolutely entitled to their own opinion, and I respect all of yours. Please keep in mind , that while ,yes you can, and should let your opinion be known,  the same document that guarantees that right , is the same one  that protects the rights that myself, my family, and my friends fought, and some died for. The Constitution isn't tailored to any specific person, or class of people. It is for eveyone. But, in case you aren't paying attention, one small issue at a time, they are setting precedence in taking away those rights. And the genius of them doing it is, they  aren't hiding it at all. We are too busy bickering with one another that not many see that the anger people feel about certain issues need to be directed at the source, not our neighbors. And the middle class, they better realize soon, that doing all this to further the elites goals, isn't by any means, actually going to ensure a place at the table for them when it happens. Where does that leave all of them.? Getting snubbed by who they were working for, and living with the people whose rights, and lives they destroyed. I am sure that will end well. This is not a democracy,  nor a republic. At best it's authoritarian, most defenately witnessing tyranny, except it seems to be accepted. Standing mute at times , legally, means someone does not object, so it is assumed as consent. If people wait until it affects them, and is at their doorstep, it is a lost cause. That will mean the rights are gone, no way to choose and it becomes enforced. Newest example I can think of is the House Joint Resolution 76, that only 5 of Congress voted against by the way, which gives the metro rail corp. Cart blanche to enter any property, business or home, both private and federal owned, for any reason, without a warrant. Trump signed it into law already. Look it up. I couldn't make this up if I tried. It is hppening fast. We need to stick together and point the finger back where the problems have come from before it is too late. Stand up for anyone you see who's right are violated. Stranger or not. Defenately stand for yours. Everytime someone let's it slip, is another one closer to having none.

I understand that something, or someone may have irritated you, made you angry, or did some kind of wrong to you, or  a loved one. Heck, they could just be a genuinely bad person. It still remains a personal decision to actually get mad, or stress over it. And, that is where it can stop. Now, if you were able to identify that something has made you angry, question it.

"Remote work is the only way forward. Less emissions, (think about how much of your lifetime driving is going to and from work) more free or working time, less expensive for the company, less expensive for you, safer.

(don't know how you able to play with dog at the end of video) for a typical 8 hour working day (or 9/80 schedule , but let's say 8hours). that's about 5 hours of free labor you put there everyday.
i sure hope you are paid enough to justify that 50% of free labor hours. because if you are paid, say 25 dollar per hour (and that's a  low number in NYC), you just wasted 125 dollar on your commute each day in term of labor. that's 32k a year just for working days. 

smart thing to do is to move closer, i am certain you could do better with 32k extra + whatever you paying for rent today.",0.968,161
