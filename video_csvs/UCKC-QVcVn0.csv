"Indeed. A clear glass container is a pan to film: lots of reflections, etc. you usually spread it with dulling spray. So, I had the machine shop bead blast it, then I learned from advanced viewers that they though it was chilled. Frankly there was too much shot to reshoot, so I add the note. Those second unit shots were done several months before the ""master"" shots (I.e., the ones with me). It was just an error on my part to us the clear jar.

This is a reflection in a change in how people use YouTube over the last five plus years.
