Yes, there are many Block 4 boosters already in the fleet (most of the fleet at this point), although no Block 5 boosters yet.  SpaceX has stated that they will not fly a block 3 booster more than twice.... I don't know if that applies to the Falcon Heavy tho... since it is based on Block 3 boosters and the side boosters are already flown....",-0.9349,135

So block 5 is the last Block according to SpaceX so they can design Falcon heavy. Falcon heavy is designed and built about to launch so the block 5 is locked in. So the block 3 has done its job and is now literally in the way. Rockets are big and they have to be stored somewhere.

"Why 2 burns? You said it yourself. To go from a circular parking orbit to a geosynchronous transfer orbit you have to do a burn on the opposite side of the planet to where you want the satellite  to be positioned. The satellite itself then burns to  insert itself into a new circular parking orbit when it's on the opposite side of the planet to the second burn (of the second stage). This parking orbit is at geostationary distance. There are further complications inasmuch as the plane of the geostationary orbit is the same as the equatorial plane, but the plane of the second stage parking orbit is a bit weird (consequence of launch location). Second burn compensates for this. You can see this adjustment on the video where the ground trace rises from Mauritius into the Indian Ocean during the second burn. The satellite geostationary insertion burn will also correct orbital plane. These correction burns explain why it takes a day or so to dock with the space station. Similar issues exist. The other complication is that the Earth is spinning under the orbit.",-0.2263,202
