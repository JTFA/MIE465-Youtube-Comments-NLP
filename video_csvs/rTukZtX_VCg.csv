"Always...always, a ton of fun and games until someone in the crowd dies, and other people in the crowd get their limbs sheared off from the pyrotech canisters that house the fireworks as they explode and go flying towards all the onlookers.

Bulent Aydin Music video producer Song Writer ... If you sit far enough away its not dangerous at all... Sounds like you don't have kids yet.. When you are a parent its almost child abuse if you don't take them to dangerous activities..DON'T GET ME STARTED ON KIDS TAKING ANY SPORT.. No Soccer Mom or Football dad really cares if their kids end up getting Concussions.  As long as those parents have a kid on a sports team.  For some Parents its a wet dream and reason to have kids... For the Football team and cheerleading. . they don't care if it kills the kid as long as that kid gets a full ride scholarship.. It's all good if their kids end up Brain Dead.. As long as the parents get to sit in the bleachers and Cheer... That's American Values... And   Airshows are the best oh and Any Amusement park .. Even in the car driving to the store can kill a kid.. You just do crazy things as a parent and if no one dies then you put it in your book of good memories .. If they die.. Then Whoopsy.. Life is funny like that.. From a mom who wanted to tie pillows to my children so if the fall they just bounce back up.. Lol.. True story..,0.9052,240

YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ME, JUST LOOK!!
Edit:  The barge caught on fire soon after, but they couldn't send people out as it was dangerous conditions. We got cleared off the beach by police, and then, q firework flew sideways and onto the sand, near where we were previously sitting. Another one went off the side previously,  but landed in the water. It exploded. We actually stayed and watched the barge slowly sink as it was engulfed in flames.

Some of my best memories as a child was spent watching firework shows with my parents. Sometimes accidents happen but things like this are very rare. Millions of shows go off without a problem. If you are worried about ever last little thing in life you might as well never leave home.
