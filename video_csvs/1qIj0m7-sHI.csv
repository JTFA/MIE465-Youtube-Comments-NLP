"2 Very Big Problems with this video
1) As a Steelers fan I don't understand how TJ Watt is over Leonard Fournett. Watt was lackluster at best. Fournette completely demolished defenses.

2) No Juju? A very prominent and successful role at #2 WR. And then stepped up when AB went out!",0.882,60

Deshaun watson should be higher then number 10 and where juju,0.0772,11
Deshawn Watson should be higher I'm tried off players getting less credit cause of injuries. Its amazing what he did in 5 in a half games. Same thing with carson Wentz. Because he got injured he got snubbed of the mvp. 💯,0.1045,46

"Eli's bad play made him look bad, but Engram had a fantastic rookie season. Geno Smith's game showed how good Engram is and he's only a rookie..",0.7876,30
"Every comment here is from a Steelers fan crying about JuJu not making the top 10... look, he had a good season, but this was a stacked draft class, and when you have guys like Brown and Bell on your team that demand a ton of attention from the defense, that makes life a whole lot easier for him to rack up a ton of yards/pts. While I would still put JuJu in the top 15, I think leaving him out of the top 10 is justifiable. Also, whoever doesn't know who Lattimore is should just go home, there's no way the top two slots were going to anyone other than him and Kamara.",0.1877,127

Not even a steelers fan but if you're not gonna put juju on this list you shouldn't be making one.,0.1655,21
Ok so I paused the video from the start. I'm a saints fan. Ok if kamara isn't number 1 I'll be pissed. Being he was the rookie of the year. So I'd expect him to be number one one this. But who dat nation like this comment and leave a reply. #whodat,0.3304,58
