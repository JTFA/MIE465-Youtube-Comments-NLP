"YES, I watched all the Doctors since 1963 and I clearly remember that many Doctor didn't accept to regenerate and others gave a speech or at least a phrase before regenerating. one of the main features of the Capaldi's Doctor is that he make long speeches ( Zygon's inversion, Heaven Sent, Thin Ice, Flatline and so on), so I think it is right and normal that he ends his regeneration's life with a great speech, especially since half of his run was about finding an answer to the question ""Am I a Good Man?"" and this speech is a great answer to that question.",0.9604,116

"You say 'it seems to be based on creative reasons', what do you base that on? As for your 3 justifications -

One: Yep you're right, it does open up new story opportunities such as endless rants about how we all live in a patriarchal society and how men can't tie their own shoelaces without a woman's help ( come to think of it that's the Steven Moffat era in a nutshell as he started all this feminist drivel after being branded a sexist in the British press ). 

Two: Doctor Who has already been brought back into the public eye for all the wrong reasons, the press is repeatedly commenting on how this divisive take on the Doctor has divided fandom and many don't agree with the changes that have been made. 

Three: Again what do you base this on? Whittaker has so far only uttered two words so how can you say with any certainty that she will be 'totally different'.

Chibnall has very little control over the series as the BBC's Diversity Commission has set quotas to be met by 2020 such as 50% of on screen characters have to be female and 8% need to be LGBT, Whittaker ticks both of those boxes as we now have a feminist actress playing a gender realigned ( aka - transgender ) Doctor wearing a pride top. The BBC itself had very little say over these quotas as the corporations Diversity Commission was only created in order to get it's charter renewed by the British government. This 'risk and boldness' you speak of has only come about due to interference by members of parliament.",0.7712,298

"matthew pounder Just because it hasn't happened before doesn't mean it can't happen. And I disagree. It seems to be a creative decision more than anything else. I know if I were showrunner, I'd want to cast a woman for 3 reasons:

One: It opens up new story opportunities and adds more dimensions to the character all while giving the show a much needed shot in the arm.

Two: It'll bring the show back into the public eye.

And number three: What man could follow up Capaldi, arguably the best actor to ever take on the role? Nobody could fill his shoes- unless they're totally different from anything we've had before-which Whittaker is. 

Chibnall did say he was after ""risk and boldness"" and he delivered. I used to be against having a female Doctor for a long time, thinking it was a crazy idea pushed to appease the crazy fangirls, but now I  think it's absolutely fantastic.",0.9028,177
