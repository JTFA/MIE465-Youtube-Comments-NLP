My second year I did a beautiful placement in the south of France. I've always known that I belonged in the South of France. Last summer I worked as an animator on a camping in the gorges du verdon and I really discovered my love for tourism. so after that I decided to do my 2nd placement (coming February) in tourism/marketing, my passions. But I'm having such an hard time finding places, I hear all the time that I have such a good quality profile but that the offer is already taken, next to that I'm trying to figure out what I want, a big opportunity in a big travel agency or a local tourist office..

Seriously though, the places you travel to I wish I could just visit once. Some of the coolest vida are when your hanging out with Riley and his awesome pups in Socal. I'm also gonna say that benny has the best skills out of any in that stupid contest, and you should be great full that benny showed up in Germany to edit his/your first VLOG. Benny is the shit... Period! Don't over think shit on what we like, just do you! There's nothing to proove with your friends that have money, dude your make ing money on youtube make ing awesome ass vlogs. If I can give some constructive crisis, please stop saying that this is a paid product advertise bullshit scene. I watched every single of the 365 VLOG season just cause. I think the best episodes were when you guys were in Japan. Dude those powder puffs were so sexy. Please keep doing the same things you've been doing. I really hope benny isn't getting all Jajah galore on you because I think you guys make a great team. You just hit a million, and I really do think Benny has a part to play in that. I know this comment is long winded and such, but you Jon Janni Benny and even Richard makes me want to be a better person, and not in a way to get money, but just to be a good human. So like I said my favorite epps was you guys in Japan, my second favorite was when you guys were in South America, Columbia right? Building a school. Dude stay righteous and be yourself.
