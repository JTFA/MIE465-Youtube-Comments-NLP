"Elani Aniyvwia But how would you measure an object’s density without already knowing its mass? Weight is a very good way to measure mass because the only acceleration we’re experiencing is a known constant in a known direction. People in orbit (free fall) are a very small minority, who may need an alternative measurement method as shown in the video. How does this video prove what you just said?

Because we can measure gravity very accurately at any point on earth’s surface, and we know the mathematical relationship between gravity and mass, weight (force exerted) is an obvious way to measure mass on earth. F=ma, where we define F as the weight and a as the acceleration downwards due to gravity. If we can measure the force you exert on an instrument when you, say, stand on it, we can easily see your mass.

It is equivalence that suggests you falling towards the ground and the ground rushing up to meet you are one and the same but the force experienced inducing weight is due to the ground pushing back not gravity pulling you down.

"This is an vulgarization channel, they voluntarily make some mistakes for it to be easier to understand for noobs. For example they said that an object that is accelerating creates a force, then illustrated this with how we push a scale down when we stand on it. 
But actually that's not directly what Newton's 2nd law says, because it is about Dynamics and not statics. When you're immobile you are not accelerating so you can't apply Newton's 2nd law, except for saying that all the forces that are applied to you in that static state sum up to zero, which is actually Newton's 1st law. Then when you look at what forces are applied onto you there is on the one hand the gravitational attraction of the earth, and on the other hand the resistance of the spring scale you're standing on. Since those are the two only forces, and that they need to sum up to zero then they are opposite, so the force that the ground exerts onto you is equal to your weight, in the opposite direction. Now we apply Newton's 3rd law that's about mutual interaction, and says that if a first object is being subjected to a force by a second object, then itself exerts an opposite force onto that second object. Which leads us to conclude that as we stand on a spring that retains us from accelerating due to our weight, thanks to its own force of resistance, then we our own exert on the scale a force that is opposite to its resistance, which is itself opposite to our weight since we are immobile (thus NOT accelerating), SO we are exerting a force on the scale that's equal to our weight...

This video’s title is slightly misleading. What’s being measured here is mass, not weight. An object that weighs 200lbs on earth has a mass of 20.39 slugs (the English unit for mass is the slug). The metric equivalent for pounds is actually the Newton, not the kilogram. The Kg is a unit of mass, just as the slug is. This confuses a lot of people.

On the space station, an object’s mass can be determined independently of gravity. Since gravity is known to be 32 ft/s^2 (9.81m/s^2) near earth’s surface, an object’s mass (in slugs or kilograms) can be multiplied by 32ft/s^2 (9.81m/s^2) to get that object’s weight on earth. Gravity can be calculated for the moon (1.62m/s^2) to find the object’s weight in the moon.

Also note: don’t confuse metric and English (imperial?) units. Be consistent with units in calculations.",-0.4951,238
"capricorn1971ad I think you might be getting the definition of mass confused with weight.

To make things simple: mass is constant and correlates to how much matter an object is made of. Mass is a property of matter - not a force.

Weight, on the other hand, is a force which is the result of gravity’s pull on said mass.

Newton’s second law sums this up: F=ma alternative written as W=mg. This says that force is equal to mass multiplied by its acceleration. In the second example, weight (W) equals mass times gravity (g), which is just using different terms for the same thing.

Gravity gets very complicated, and we need Einstein’s principles to explain this where Newton’s fall short. It’s a result from a warp in spacetime made by an object with a lot of mass. This explanation gets deep. But you’re correct that gravity varies, and it does so based on the inverse square law (the distance between the objects centers 1/r^2). Calculus deals with rates of change and varying forces",0.2732,219
"capricorn1971ad that could be. In the first post, by oscillation I meant the number of times the spring oscillates in, say, one second. It will oscillate slower as the mass on the spring increases. This fact can be used to find the mass on the spring, and thus the weight from the mass after accounting for gravity.",0.0772,66

"darkfire090 :sigh: I am chill. Go read my last reply again... I'm not saying you're wrong about how it works. I'm saying, youre first reply in conjunction with the video is misleading. It is misleading because *IF* you use the definition that scishow lays out, then photons can have weight but no mass... Then you made the mass/weight equivalency, which just continues the falicy. 
Photons lack both mass and weight, that much should simply be understood. _I am not implying they do,_ the rules scishow laid out do. I am simply following scishow rules to their obvious (and inaccurate) conclusion.",-0.7699,124
"darkfire090 I'm not sure I would state what you are trying to say the way you said it. If you define wieght in the way scishow does in this episode (the force an object exerts due to gravitational acceleration), then a photon would have weight but no mass because gravity does ""pull"" on a photon and photon has momentum that can be used to push things(like a solar sail or a spring scale). If you were to shoot a beam of photons at a solar sail, their force could be measured, and there is no reason you couldn't (technically) use gravity to accelerate (change their direction, not speed) those photons. In which case, they have weight but no mass.",-0.8997,140
"darkfire090 You are being inconsistent. If something has a force, by your account, using scishows definition, it has weight. Yet you are saying it doesn't. 
And I understand the difference between Newtonian and einsteinian gravity. That has absolutely nothing to do with it, unless you want to revise your first comment in this thread, which is all I said in the first place. _I wouldn't put it that way._ Because *you* are making the implication that photons have mass in your first statement. (Edited because my italics didn't work)",0.0772,107
"darkfire090 you didn't say anything about quantam relativity in your original post on this thread. I don't think I have been clear. If you only take the information that is presented in this video and your ORIGINAL post in this thread (because my ENTIRE original comment is only discussing these things), then the implication is that photons have mass and your comment is wrong. I am NOT saying that is how it is. I AM saying your comment, your original comment, that didn't discuss anything having anything to do with qm, is a continuation of the mesleading explanation because in classical mechanics, WHICH WAS THE ONLY THING THAT HAD BEEN DISCUSSED, there was the implication that photons would have mass, and then you tried to correct the same thing using nothing more than classical physics.
I have a pretty strong understanding of qm and certainly don't need it explained to me. I NEVER ONCE said how anything actually works. I simply said that you and scishow we're being misleading.",0.9278,187

"herranton1979 not really, like I said it gets weird when you go into quantum relativity. Photons have no mass and no weight, they have energy and momentum (which /some/ people call relativistic mass, but this does not mean it has any actually mass, it's just a term that used to be a place-over to explain how photons have force without 'mass' but is falling out of fashion because it... confuses people).  

By definition a thing without mass literally cannot have weight. We know photons have no mass, therefore they do not have weight. Yeah and I wasn't clear on this, but F=m*a is a basic formula for finding the force of an object but it doesn't work with photons because they have no mass. That's why in quantum relativity, mass and energy are not the same thing, and there are different formulas for determining the force of objects without mass.",-0.9181,176
"herranton1979 photons are weird and while don't have traditional invariant mass (though impossible to measure we know they have zero rest mass), they do have relativistic mass (or the total energy of a body). But that's essentially semantics and in relativity, mass and energy are separated concepts. Also in relatively, gravity isn't a force but a wave that does not 'push' or 'pull' light. 

So essentially, photons have energy and momentum, but no mass. In Scishow's definition of weight it still includes force, which is F=m*a, and as photons have no mass, it therefore has no weight.",-0.6124,123

"it's really dumb.. 
you see, if gravity fluctuates, the pressure on the spring would fluctuate.. rendering the idea useless right off the bat.

gravity is a field that is projected by mass, the larger the mass the more gravity it can created, therefore gravity is never a constant, without gravity there is no way to measure weight besides calculating a estimated weight based upon mass and density, which will never be exact, and would only work with known things.

weight is a man made invention, an effect of gravity, which is a variable.
