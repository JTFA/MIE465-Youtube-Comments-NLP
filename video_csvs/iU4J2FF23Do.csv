"Obidiah 1. The so called white or red devil is Esau the bible speaks of. The police originated to catch runaway slaves. The one world order is ran by the so-called jews of Isreal: Revelation 2:9 & 3:9. The jew or biblically synagogue of satan rules the world. They owned the ships and plantations that the slaves were bought here on, they own the federal reserve, they are the law and own the prisons, they own the media, they are the majority of orginized crime, they are the reason for wars, starvation, geniside and slavery they stole the identity of the Negro their God(red jesus is the Antichrist people, Jesus and the Jews are NEGRO: Acts 13:1. Job 30:30) and their land/Isreal (stole and trodden down by gentiles Luke 21:24) via the Balfour agreement and given to the Rothschilds. They rule the world. They are the real enemy and the red devil the bible speaks of. The hexagon on the Israeli flag is the mark of the beast and is the Rothschilds symbol. They worship the devil. Read the Talmud, The Bible, The International Jew, The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, The Thirteenth Tribe, The Iron Curtain Over America, Israel's 5 Trillion Dollar Secret to name a few if you dont believe me.
