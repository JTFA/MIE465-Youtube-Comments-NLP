My ears is working just fine. In this instance this is only constructive criticism. I feel here she wasn't at her best and yes her backup singers sounded better than her on this day. Listen when they are singing in unison on the chorus line and on the bridge. Demi was not stable with one of the backup singers who was singing along side her. Both of the back singers vocals was consistent and stable. IMO. This is second opinion coming from a complete stranger.,-0.3907,93

Feelin' like a ten, the best I've ever been
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt
To see me like this but it gets worse (wait a minute)
Now you're out here lookin' like regret
Ain't too proud to beg, second chance you'll never get
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt
To see me like this but it gets worse (wait a minute)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
You fuckin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (ah)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
Showin' you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Feelin' inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns",-0.9804,236
"People always have something to say.... “oh the performance is dead” well that’s your vision! This is a very vocalized song and the singer needs to 1- make sure she is meshing with the girls who are harmonizing, and make sure to adjust if they don’t. 2- she is a world wide professional artist, she performs all the damn time. This is a laid back performance.... let I‎t be just that, and enjoy I‎t for what I‎t is!",0.8802,101

Vocals on point as always, but the performance side of things is just completely non-existent, which is strange as she is normally a really good performer and gives a lot of attitude, especially with this song.
