"Here is what I think the colts should do. Assuming that neither of the top 2 picks will be Saquon Barkley. The Colts have leverage right here. The Browns should want Barkley very badly. If I were Chris Ballard, I would make the Browns give there best offer for the 3rd pick. In the trade the colts should look to get the first pick of the second round. And some additional mid-round picks from this and next years draft. Once they have the 4th pick, they have leverage over the Jets and Broncos. They could those 2 to make there best offer. But maybe 2 trades is a little ridiculous. So, regardless, I think they should draft Quenton Nelson. Better linemen is there biggest need. Period.

I think that they should get a smaller but faster DT and let Joseph take on the center and guard and let the rookie have a one on one with the other guard, and if they draft good they can help the defense out by getting pressure in the quarterbacks face, and when he tries to scramble away from the pressure than Hunter and Griffin.",0.9588,135
