Amazing house and an amazing woman!,0.8356,7
"Awesome ... SaraW had the ""je ne sais quoi"" that IS this Valley.  She is first on my list of ""The Women of Silicon Valley"" ... before Marissa Mayer, before Sheryl Sandberg, before Sister Assumpta (well maybe not her ... 2nd grade teacher BTW).  I worked the ""house"" as a kid and I'm here to say that this video tells an authentic story.  The story nails it exactly the way I lived it ... told from the inside like only the few who worked all 160 rooms ... ""keeeeep building"" ...",0.765,106

"Great presentation, thanks for poating!",0.807,7
"Great video!! Luv'd that the focus was on the logistics of the house. Most videos focus on the myth surrounding Sarah & her house. I liked the realistic reasoning for why she was so into physics & s√©ances. Present day observers continue to make it seem like she was the odd ball for participating in such activities, when actually during that time such activities were VERY popular. So popular in fact that pyschics were used for entertainment at large parties. By the 1920s their popularity had died down due to investigaters exposing some as frauds.",0.9426,104
"How charming! I wish I could visit the house, it must be stunning.",0.8553,16

I am most impressed with the stairway corner pieces which blocked dust.  You don't here of a lot of super wealthy people who show any concern for their servants.   I hate that they have made up this ridiculous horror movie because that is what people will remember of her.,-0.3781,52
I came here after someone compared the large house to the mansion or other homes in resident evil that are huge and convoluted....this home looks like a place you can lock a bunch of doors and shove multiple nonsense puzzles in,-0.5106,43

I just watched the movie and I'm so excited to visit the house.,0.4795,14
I live 3 miles away from here :),0.4588,8
"I live in southern California, but every few years my family would drive up to visit family and we'd always visit the Winchester Mansion. It's truly an incredible feat of _how far_ grief and paranoia can take the human mind. I suppose we're lucky Sarah had the wealth and the spiritual 'drive' to create this.",0.8271,62
"I love this house and all the Queen Anne details. Then to own a haunted house, and build the house to confuse the spirits. The stained glass windows are complex in design. I have wanted to see this house since l frist heard about it in Art History classes. Also to maybe see a ghost or two would be great fun!  I'll scream bloody murder.",-0.6476,72
"I toured it in the 90's. It isn't scary, infact Mrs. Winchester is still there. She stays in the yellow room which she was locked in from the earthquake for several days. 
There's also a maid, she had a very high position in the house. Really.",0.3875,56

I want to go there sooooo badly!,-0.4753,8
I want to live there,0.0772,5
I was grew up in New Jersey and spent my summers in San Jose. I was afraid of this house because we went to the movie theater (no longer there). I went here when I was about 20 and loved it. We still go out there to see family and now my aunt lives just off Winchester Boulevard and the house is about 1 mile from them. I brought my daughters there the first time we went back and they loved it. I'm so excited to see that they finally made a movie about her and this house.,0.8983,106

I'm afraid to get locked in or lost inside lol,0.128,10
I've been here whole bunch of times when I was a kid all the way till teenager I love this place,0.6369,21
I've been in that house several times. Born and raised in San Jose and I can honestly say...THIS VIDEO & LOVELY HOST DID A FANTASTIC JOB showing the Winchester Mystery House. Sarah Winchester was not crazy & yes she believed in spirits haunting her. If you take a tour at night (Flashlight) you'll see why. Those are Tiffany windows might I add! They're worth more than the tech nerds make in a lifetime because they're Mrs. Winchester's. Ha. Good job on her house! üëå,0.954,97
If I ever go to the Winchester house for a tour I‚Äôll definitely say hi to Sarah once I enter the house,0.4019,24
"If I won the powerball for half a billion ... yeah.  I would buy this house.

Me and my cats would be in heaven",0.8481,26
"If there are really ghosts in that house, those ghosts must be have a high taste of art and really appreciate her works",0.4576,24
Incredible!!,0.0,3
It was cool learning about this side of the Winchester House vs just the haunted side that everyone knows.,-0.2023,20
Its a great place. When I lived in SJ I'd go visit it - glad I did as I've not been back to Cal since (not when I had free time). I heard (before the 90s_ they used to have  longer tours but stopped those long ago. I'd love to see much more of the place.,0.8793,63
Its an amazing work of art.,0.5859,7
"I‚Äôve been to the Winchester house 4x now I love it and actually got a strange phenomenon in a picture, I believe this place is super haunted",0.6369,30

One of the most haunted mansions in the States and yet people are casually strolling in the house.. Amazing,0.2748,20
One thing I found amazing was how she used the skylights to create natural light on the ground floor. In spite of the fact that she had electricity she also had natural light from overhead sources. She was able to employ artisans from all disciplines to practice and perfect their craft as a benefactor,0.8807,56

Thank you for sharing this  love this crazy house,0.8201,9
Thank you for this. I'm in awe. I love this side of her that only a few knows about. I will never see her as the crazy lady again. You opened my eyes to something magical.,0.6486,41
"Thank you so much for providing a more honest portrail of Sarah and her home. I have been researching her and the Pardee, Merriman, Winchester families for over 20 years. She was not crazy or haunted. The was a brilliant, college educated, independent women at a time when women had no rights. She ran a working farm, orchards and dehydrating plant. She paid her workers well and provided benefits at a time when it was unheard of. A truly wonderful person who does not deserve to be slandered and have the macabre be her legacy.",0.9705,107
"Thank you, for showing Winchester House in a more positive light as a beautiful yet many faceted and strangely unique house.",0.8439,23
That house looks more like a maze,0.4201,7
That was a beautiful story üíì,0.5994,6
This house alone being built in the late 1800s was so creative. Imagine her being an architect in a time like today. She was really wise that‚Äôs what‚Äôs spooky to me. Completely ahead of her time.,0.8241,44
"This is the first video I've seen that's treated the Winchester House as a proper house and not just some creepy ghost destination. Great video, that house is architecturally amazing!",0.784,33

i hope she is now at peace with her family   beautiful lady,0.8834,12
it‚Äôs so refreshing to not hear about spirits and ghosts.  i look upon this house as Sarah‚Äôs R & D house where she was constantly trying out new products and ideas.  Amazing testimonial to a brilliant woman.,0.8225,44
"there is really no proof that she was a Occultist, more of a numerologist and keeping busy after loosing her only child as a baby and then her husband and being the wealthiest woman in the world , she could afford to indulge her interest in architecture and build this big home, and keeping busy she could maybe forget for a while about her child and husband .  Her servants said no seance was done in her time, in the ""seance room"",",0.0808,88
this kind of explanation about Sarah Winchester and her house is what I LIKE. Salute.,0.4995,17
