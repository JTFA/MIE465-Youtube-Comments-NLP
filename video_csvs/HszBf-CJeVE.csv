"Y'all are bogus for talking about her race and skin-tone. ""For a black girl she sure does have thin hair,"" so what? Everyone has a different amount of hair. She still looks amazing with or without a lot of hair. ""Zendaya's hair isn't curly,"" first of all it is. People have different curl patterns and her curls are looser. It's still curls regardless. ""She is light for a mixed girl,"" not all mixed people have the same skin tone. Some mixed people are darker because of what they are mixed with. You don't know if she's Puerto-Rican or anything else besides black and white so stop. It's irrelevant to her so she probably doesn't care about what you guys say or think about her.
