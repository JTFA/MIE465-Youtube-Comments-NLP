"One of the kids I babysit 3 years old and she is really developed athletically, but not mentally because her mom babies her and she still nurses and her mom isn't making any indication to stop. she has a very small vocabulary and always insists on being called ""a baby"". I know that kids play pretend but I think her mom is feeding into the three year old's fantasy and letting her get away with things because she is pretending. I think she is babying her too much and I should probably let it go but I am just worried for her future.",-0.3612,110
