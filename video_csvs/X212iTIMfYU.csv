"Ahhh! Welcome to NYC! I feel you on the skin, I just came back from Thanksgiving with my fam is California and I broke out as soon as I got off the plane back in NYC. Hmmm my lids are super oily, too! Have you tried the Urban Decay 24/7 primer? It's a classic and works on me! The Lorac primer also works! I find that if I don't layer a primer under any type of makeup (long-wearing or not) it doesn't hold up on my lids! I hope this helps :)",0.9094,104

"Mi Anne Chan I know a lot of people prefer brushes or beauty blenders, it’s just with this kind if it doesn’t work with the cushion then the formula is off. I didn’t mean you can’t use the tool you prefer, just that part of a cushion foundation is that it should work perfectly with the pad given. It’s why most of them cost so much. They should be buildable too. I think I’m expecting too much from Wet N Wild tho. Thanks for the reply! I love seeing products tested out!",0.9669,113
"Mi Anne Chan Thank you so much for the rec!! I've been testing UDPP in eden for the last week, and it's worked *much* better than everything else I've tried!!

That eyeshadow looks amazing!,0.6239,5
That's a good point! I wanted to show half my face using the sponge applicator and then one side with a brush so I could cover all bases. The wet n wild sponge is great if you want something with fuller coverage! And of course!!!! <3,0.9075,52
The peach looks like a nice nude on you!,0.68,10
The product comes in a sponge/cushion and can be used with the sponge applicator which definitely does work (gives really full coverage) but using it with a brush is just my preference because it's faster. That's honestly how I feel about most cushion foundations! I usually just use the cushion applicator when I'm out and about! Thanks so much for watching! <3,0.9374,70
The way she says Balmain.. 😖😖,0.0,8
The whole point of a cushion foundation is to use the cushion. If it doesn’t work with the cushion then it isn’t a true cushion foundation. 🤷🏻‍♀️,0.4215,37
