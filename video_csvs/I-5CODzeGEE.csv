Something I've thought about a lot is Kylo maybe intentionally cutting off some limbs of his own, we don't see it but it would have been cool if, for example, when Han confronts Kylo he could notice that his arms are both mechanical and be horrified by what his son did to himself. Kylo would explain and try to sound like he was proud of it but you could see that that wasn't entirely true. I just like the idea of Kylo Ren intentionally disfiguring himself with his own lightsaber to feel closer to Darth Vader, it's twisted and it kind of brings to mind how some people cut themselves in real life bringing another level to it and cementing Kylo Ren as an emo edge lord.",0.1545,192

Eventually, the brother killed the sister. Before the sister died, she prophesied that she would one day be reborn and defeat him. Rey is the first force user reborn.
