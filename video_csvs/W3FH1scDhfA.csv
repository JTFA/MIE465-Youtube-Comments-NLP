Huh. Well, maybe you could sue them.  I'm not too optimistic of your odds, but it could work; the style certainly looks unique; these were the only two videos I could easily find that looked that smooth and with that pose and motion.

"Jack Murray I have contacted him on Twitter and waiting his response. Why wouldn’t the manager inform ScottDW straight after he was contacted by the agency? Him not being notified doesn’t make sense. There’s still no need to know certain equipment because both ScottDW’s video and this video can be replicated with multiple cameras, microphones, camera accessories etc. Also, you can replicate a style with certain cinematography, colour grading, colour correction. In fact, what do you mean by style? Neither video resembles the other video other than the fact that they both have someone doing a stunt on a motorcycle. You can keep claiming that of this is proven true but you still have yet to provide any evidence.",0.4956,141
"Jack Murray I never called you a liar, I’ve just asked for evidence. Which you have given me none of therefore I have no reason to believe you. You come across as a huge ScottDW fan or someone who just wants to cause a stir to get because you have nothing better to do. So you just copy and paste the same comment to spam people. Your story still has holes in it. It’s easy for a professional crew just to recreate a shot. There’s no groundbreaking filmmaking here or in ScottDW’s video. There’s no reason why they would have to email ScottDW’s manager for essentially a tutorial. It’s also perfectly reasonable to assume that someone, especially a manager, would still let ScottDW know about such a significant email, even at the time of surgery.",0.6904,162
Jack Murray Know what? I guess they may have 😳,0.0,11
"Jack Murray None of what you said is even remotely true, I even checked all of ScottDW’s Instagram posts from October 2017-February 2018. You need to stop replying to people’s comments that they need to check out ScottDW’s shitty video when they really don’t. See if you can actually answer any of these questions:

ScottDW has made his own comment on this video whinging that Squarespace ripped him off (when they probably don’t even know he exists). Why would ScottDW complain that they ripped him off if his manager had already been contacted months prior to the release of a video? 

Why would the crew email ScottDW’s manager about the equipment used when they are professionals and can use the equipment they need? 

Why would they email the manager just a few months prior anyways? The total amount of time it takes to make ads like this and of this quality take far longer than just a few months.

Can you actually provide and links to sources or evidence for your claims? How about you actually do the research you? :P",-0.302,208

Jude Diggens actually everything I’m saying is 100% true so I don’t know where you are coming from. Nothing was ever mentioned in his Instagram posts from October because he was never informed by his manager. On the day he released all of this information he then found out that he was contacted by squarespace. The reason they wanted to know equipment is because they wanted to replicate the videos style. Clearly you don’t know anything about commercials because they can be done in less than a few months...even shorter. I did my research and if you want proof right from ScottDW DM him on Instagram and ask him if all the claims are true that I’m telling you. Why don’t you just not be so critical of something that’s actually proven true. I’ll wait for your response when he messages you back.,0.8131,168
Jude Diggens because at that time ScottDW was losing his team due to not being able to make videos because of his surgery/recovery from lime disease. So in that time people were leaving. Squarespace didn’t make the video. They hired an advertisement company to make the video hence why they wanted it to look exact. Believe me it’s still a weird situation. They even asked how some of the shots were created. All of this was discussed on ScottDW’s Instagram story where he literally told the whole story. Call me a liar all you want but if you think about it why would I create this lie? So 30 people in this comment section could watch ScottDW’s version. That doesn’t make sense in my opinion unless I wanted to inform people that this was ripped off.,0.0,158
