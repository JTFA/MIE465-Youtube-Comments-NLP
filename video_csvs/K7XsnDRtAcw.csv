"We had a stray kitten turn up at our firehouse about ten years ago.  One of the guys heard mewing sounds coming from behind the dryer, and I managed to entice her out (apparently, I was the only one there that day who could calm her down).  Unfortunately, my husband and I couldn't keep her because we were living in a VERY cramped rental and already had a cat at the time, so one of the probies took her home with him and named her Smokey because she was found at the firehouse.  Apparently, his whole family took to spoiling her rotten after that.  I hope she's still being spoiled by them to this day, she certainly deserved it!",0.2942,132
"Well when a cat decides your theirs theres not much you can do about it. Not that most of us would want to. 
I like how people send her things. She has so many toys. My cats on the other hand prefer milk jug rings, hairbands and Qtips. They've had bought toys they just prefer other things. 
I wonder if she ever gets so many treats from people that she can't possibly eat or play with if it's a toy and what they do with them. Do they get donated to the local shelters? 
Wish I could afford to send her a Mainstays Deluxe Plush Blanket. The deluxe is so very soft and plushy. My Harlequin absolutely loves to knead it with her paws. She's why there's now little strings on it. But she just loves it so much that I don't have the heart to stop her. But it's only a $13 blanket so not a big deal.She even has her brother doing it now.
I might use my older one to make a pillow for them. Or maybe a couple of the or make removable covers to be able to wash it since it's a full/queen blanket.",0.9583,219
