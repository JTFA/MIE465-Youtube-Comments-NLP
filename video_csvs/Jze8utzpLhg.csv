"Apple trees are grafted rather than grown from seed. If you want to match the taste of the apple you need to cut a branch from the original tree, otherwise you may get bitter and sour apples. Also, avocado trees don't fruit for at least 5 years if you can be bothered to wait that long.",-0.5574,61

"Aubrey's Zoo I don't have channels for you, but some tips. 
- Inform yourself on what type of soil your plant needs, that can be really important
- keep track of when to water your plants by noting everything down
- buy LED plant lights to reduce suffering of the plants during cold and dark months
- be patient. I've tried growing an avocado tree for I think 6 times now and it hasn't worked yet",-0.1181,80

"Celery will never grow as big as original celery, best to use the leaves that sprout for soup and such. Lettuce can be iffy as well.

They may grow shorter if in a pot. Not sure.",0.7906,83
