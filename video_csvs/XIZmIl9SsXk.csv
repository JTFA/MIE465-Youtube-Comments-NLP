"I have had the mango and the lime and the cherry. I say the lime is my favorite because I put lime in my coke and Pepsi anyway. Anywho I found that I get heartburn sometimes.

I give normal coke a 4.8/5 (that stuff is my I drink atleast 2 cans of it a day.) When I tasted the diet cherry I was actually enjoyed it. It just tasted like cherry coke with a weak diet after taste. I'd give it a 3/5 and would drink it again.

They do sell Coke with Stevia for sweetener but the problem is they still add sugar.
When they start making Coke Zero with Stevia only that will be great. For those of us that have sugar issues Stevia is the answer!! Hey Coke when are you going to make diet and Zero with Stevia only, when you do you won't be able to keep up with the demand!! Because Stevia does not affect sugar levels. It really sucks Coke that I really like Coke Zero but I have to put to the back of my mind the harmful aspartame.",0.703,127

It is like one day I just felt saturated with their taste and would rather drink a Crystal Light drink or water.  My favorite drink when I am out and about is Vitamin Water.  Become dehydrated is a real possibility when you have had bariatric surgery and getting enough vitamins throughout the day is also a real challenge, so Vitamin water does it for me.
