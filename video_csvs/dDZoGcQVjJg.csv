"+Justan Optimist I feel like you and others are glossing over the word ""tends."" I specifically said that to ensure people realize this isn't some kind of law of jazz nature, I was just trying to give some perspective to the people saying ""How can people like it,"" And was saying it tends, once again emphasis on the tends, to be more for those who practice jazz, study music theory, or enjoy more complex harmonies. Once again, I feel must say tends a couple hundred more times to really point out I'm only trying to give those people a gleam why some others are loving this while they don't. 

I literally never said You don't like collier, you don't like jazz. You're just assuming things illogically. :( I said it tends to be more appreciated by those who do appreciate that genre and such. Never said it can only be appreciated by those people, and I never said you have to like him to like jazz.

...so please Justan, don't assume such weird assumptions just because I wanted to give some insight to those who couldn't understand why so many people love his music.",0.9917,217
"+Nana the very basic point you missed is, that you don't have to like it. 
I for example highly dislike Schoenberg, yet his work is art. 
The only rule there is for art, and that rule is highly debatable, is that art should serve no other purpose but art.  
As long as the artist proclaims something is art, it simply is (as that fulfills the rule above).  
Furthermore its the artists job, if he likes so, to sell the idea of his work or beauty of it. 
You are simply not sold on the beauty of Jacobs music nor the idea. 

Not an issue though, nothing you have to work for. 
If apple cant sell me the idea and design of the iPhone, I am not buying it, as simple as that. 
That doesn't make the phone bad, or not a phone, it's simply not the phone for me. 

(Or put simple: Jacobs music is music for musicians, just like Snarky Puppy is and Steely Dan or Electric Prunes were. )",0.7568,199
"+gado, Okay geez, I understand your point, I was just pointing out his music tends, emphasis on the tends, to be more likely to be enjoyed by people who enjoy music theory. And when I mean interested in harmony, I mean understanding and knowing the harmonies. I'm not making some kind of hard law on why you can't enjoy this, I'm literally saying it's fine if you don't like it, maybe the music's just not for you, or it's not to your taste. I'm not trying to assault your taste in music, I was just offering a possible reason why some of the people here felt they didn't understand why people liked it. Like sharktamer who commented on it. Instead of just understanding he didn't like the music, he felt the need to try and insult the music as a whole by summing it up as an uninteresting package stock music.",0.9599,169

I have never seen an act as polarizing as Collier, not Tupac, not Taylor Swift, not even Milli Vanilli. 

Herbie couldn't actually play with Collier on the Harmony video, because Collier doesn't actually play with anyone. He only plays with himself. Literally.

I understand why they are doing this, but that doesn't mean I have to agree with it. There are far more deserving musicians that should be pushed on the stage than Collier, but Collier is polarizing and creates debate; like this. For a genre of music that is almost dead with the millennial generation, this controversy is the absolute best thing that could happen. Instead of dying out a mediocre death, it will be prolonged by renewed interest, and when Collier is long forgotten, ten thousand new fans will keep the artform alive because they were initially turned on by this crazy, whacked out youth. And you know what? I look forward to it, because it will probably lead to a new evolution of the art form. I still don't respect Collier as an artist, though.

Perfect pitch is impressive, but it isn't a learned skill, so I don't know if we should count this. Negative harmony is not very complex, and has been done for quite a while now. The exact idea of negative harmony, perhaps not, but mirroring things over an axis has been done for centuries. Bartok was fond of inversion over the tonic. 12 tone writing is all about flipping things over an axis. How about the very concept of a motif? Flipping notes around some axis, though cool, is not all that impressive. In my opinion, Jacob is only absolutely professional at three instruments, and sort of only two. He is a wonderful piano player, a great bass player, and he's a pretty good singer. Yes, he can play a lot more, but most of those are string instruments, and he is by no means amazing at them. He gets the job done, and it is admittedly very impressive. He isn't the first one, though. Paul Hindemith was proficient at every/most orchestral instruments, as well as being a virtuoso violist. 

He is wonderful, and one of my idols. However, saying he is the best ever ignores all the other musicians out there. He is one of the best of this generation, but he hasn't become truly great yet. It's understandable, because he's in his early 20s. I'm absolutely positive he'll write some really amazing pieces of music at some point. His music is already quite sophisticated and very fun, though he does take a ""throw everything at a piece of music"" approach to music.",0.9988,432
Jacob's synesthetic appreciation of music is so remarkable and puts into words what I'm sure many of us feel when taking in a new piece of music. What a blessing that he's bopping about during our lifetimes.,0.9248,39

"Jens Haugset The point is that if you already know Jacob maybe this could appear like a ""simple""  exhibition. But is the same with other Ted guests, if you know their opinion on the subject there's no new concept for you.
Here his knowledge is shared, because his approach to composition is innovative and brilliant and conveys feelings in an effective but unusual way.",0.7391,71
"Jens Haugset Well, I guess we see things differently, but that's ok.  He talked about other stuff than just promoting himself. Like part way through where he talked about communication/ language that doesn't involve words for example.   Don't see how that is promoting his album.  It could be, but so could anything at that point.  I really don't think that concept is going to sell more albums.   What it does do is open minds to see both the inefficiency of spoken language, maybe put a little less stock in it,  and also understand and appreciate other facets of communication than just spoken language like body language,  music,  touch,  telepathy,  and even just appreciating different languages more.  You have to admit we aren't the greatest at communication.  And people tend to have a very narrow view of things.   Maybe seeing the music in everything is part of how he got so good.  It's everywhere already, everything has a vibration.   Maybe he just tunes in and channels it.",0.9788,189
"Jens Haugset he did speak at the end though. Js Among other things he discussed, like how his visuals worked, was a pretty powerful message,  that we don't need permission or to be chosen by an industry to be successful anymore.   Maybe just wasn't the topic you were looking for?  Also,  As far as the playback/looping,  he wouldn't be able to do what he does without it,  I can tell you that,  only can play so many instruments at once.   :)",0.9493,94

Not anyone can sing microtones, that is simply false on it's face, but the thing that makes Jacob's singing phenomenal is not only that he sings microtones but that he uses them in ways that are counterintuitive to 99.9% of musicians. Sure you can find many in Armenia who can sing using intervals that we don't use in the west or people using microtones in ethnic music, but find me some one who moves from one tone to the other in 1/3 tones?
Or some one who moves from C to F instinctively dividing this 4th interval in three equally spaced tones AND harmonises this movement?

This is utterly unbelievable even for people with absolute pitch.

Furthermore the truly unbelievable thing about him is not just one skill, It's that he has som many skills at the same time. His vocal range is also out of this world for example. His work as an arranger at the age of 17 puts that of many veteran arrangers to shame. His bass playing is also stellar. An upright bass is one of the most difficult instruments to improv convincingly on, most players can oly do this after a decade of study. 
He was improving complex basslines on an upright at 16, while singing and even though it's not his main instrument!!!

There simply is no equal, not Prince, not Stevie Wonder, not Todd Rundgren, no one compares.",0.8472,262
Took a while for Jacob to grow on me but damn I'm glad he did,0.1154,15
"Truly amazing Jacob! Let me tell you why this is so incredible. Jacobs understanding of jazz music theory and phrasing while being technical is amazing and he is able to produce chords that truly express emotional context. The reason why many of you may not enjoy or appreciate this style and approach is because of how your ears have been trained with mainstream music, meaning basic chord sequences, simple melodies, etc.. And there's nothing wrong with this, as music is a diverse art platform. Many are use to safe and familiar music choices in songs, and there's nothing wrong with that. But to totally disregard Jacob Collier, a multiple grammy winner by the way (if you're someone who basses success off material success) then you would see many professionals view Jacob as incredible. Disregarding him is silly and a loss. Even if you don't think you would like the music he would make I highly suggest you familiarize yourself with his other music to diverse yourself in music culture. He's incredible! Sometimes you need to feel a bit uncomfortable before you truly understand something. What he's doing isn't just random noise but a whole bunch of musical theory, something many musicians who study in college take years to grasp. He's almost like a genius mathematician , because music and sound is essentially math. Each choice is intentional and thought out. What an amazing dude.

"wtf Marc DeGiovanni, I'm a musician and I know about all the backing track and the overdubbed (actually the harmonizer), but I respect him because of his knowledge on harmony and his sense of aesthetics that's extraordinary. Listen to his live not-backing-track performances like ""Jacob Collier live session for Jazz FM"", ""Jacob Collier When I fall in love"", ""Jacob Collier and Jamie Collum - Crazy She calls me"", ""jacob Collier - Danny Boy"", ""Jacob Collier - In my room WDR"", or watch a live stream of him reharmonizing stuff that his fans send him. Anyway, he composes everything that is on his own songs, how could he really perform live all the crazy groove without the usage of looping and overdubbing and backing track?  Most of his fans are musicians because we try to make music that we like, we try to find that divine chords progressions and it's hard to find them. When we listen to jazz fusion stuff like Adam Neely, Herbie Hancock, Maxo (Max Coburn), Dirty Loops, Jacob Collier, we listen to those chord progression (with that groove and that crazy colorful instrumentation) WE WANT THAT! and thus we admire this! The COMPOSITION ITSELF, not so much the performance. Because it's kinda mysterious, I can't just listen one chord progression that Jacob does and automatically know what this is, even having studied music for almost 10 years. I can't. Always there's that one chord that throws your mind away and you ask ""what is that? what modulation is that?"". This is awesome, so don't come to say that ""the fan boys are just crazy bitches"", please. There's no myth, there's no lie, there's no delusion. It's just plain simple music stuff, that makes us really curious to know how his does that and because he knows exactly what he is doing and he openly talks about, then we simply can't help but admire him. That's all.",0.9759,379

This goes for you and all the other ignorant haters in this comments section - it's fine that you don't like his music, but do you have to be so closed minded that you can't put that down to the fact that you have a different taste as opposed to him being objectively 'bad?' Jacob is obviously someone who many people respect, look up to and enjoy in terms of his music - open your eyes and see that.",0.768,86
