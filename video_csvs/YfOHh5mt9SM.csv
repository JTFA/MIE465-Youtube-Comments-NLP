"For years I've always felt like nothing is real... A PART from what I touch. 
It helps me since no matter what I do, I have a ground with reality, so I know I'm still ""there"" in some kind of way, but it also freaks me out, because not feeling that anyting is close, or real, is now usual for me, so when anyone ""enter"" my reality by touching me, the sensation is very violent and I have to fight back a panic attack, the same ones that started the whole thing. Like, I'm living in that world where everything seems so far away and just... Not real, but whenever I touch something it's like I suddenly realize that they EXIST ! So when people force this feeling on me, this creates a rush of anxiety and everything and it creeps me out because I suddenly don't have any control over reality anymore.

I still don't know if it's derealisation, but I'd just prefer if people were not touching me...",-0.9228,193

The way you describe your condition is exactly as mine. It's still weird hearing people talk about it since I had this before the Internet and doctors I saw never really understood it. So I lived for a couple of decades thinking I was some freak of nature, and it was very isolating.  Diagnosis does help.

"I am not saying I have it, because I'm definitely not so severe. However, I have been trying to figure out what is going on with me. I will always space out and get sucked in my head numerous times in a day and it makes it difficult for me to focus. For example, when I  try to get ready in the morning, I'd always struggle with trying to remind and snap myself out of daydreaming. It is very difficult to not sit down and accidentally space out for 10 mins then realize and try to snap myself out of it. I'll check the clock and start freaking out. It'll happen several times in a morning and I'll always end up late and rushed. Even just simply going home quickly and leaving I will sit down and blank out and lose track of time and place.
 Idk if its something that affects my memory, but I feel like its making me so forgetful. I'd snap out of it and totally forget what happening and need a minute to recap and realize I am running late and need to go somewhere. I'd forget to do things because I get too invested in my mind.  Like doing certain chores or to grab my homework. I would blank out in the middle of it, daydream and kind of just walk away half awake.

 Its definitely frustrating, but at the same time I cant say I hate it as it brings me a certain bit of comfort to be able to just leave situations and go to my own world.",0.6068,287

It was a day, like every other day. I get up and get dressed and go to school. Except I kind of just felt like I was going along with it. You might expect that from a normal routine, but it got more... like... apparent later in the day, I guess is the best way to describe it. Everything was going fast, and everything just seemed fake. It seemed as though someone painted every scene that I experienced that day but it was kind of blurry, and colorless? I thought I was having a normal day, but near the middle of the day I just realized it wasn't right. I could not remember anything, and trying to mentally replay the day just seemed weird. And me as a person, I didn't exactly feel there, yet I don't think it was depersonalization, I just felt as though my surroundings were dark, very dark, and once again blurry. I can't explain it but I just felt gone, yet I was still there. I could see what was happening. Later that night I began to feel more like myself, though I was completely aware how different the day was.
I don't know if it's normal for this thing to just come out of no where and then leave as fast as it came, but that's what my experiences usually are. Some days are normal, but some days everything is just warped and different? They are always more colorless and just... Different. That's the best I can describe it.
I haven't been diagnosed with this, which is why I didn't say I too have the disorder, but I think I more like have small ""episodes"" I guess you'd call them? Small ""experiences"" here and there? I'm not sure what to call it, but all I know is you aren't alone, because I've felt this too.",0.9607,381
"I feel spaced out and dissociated a LOT of the time, but I'm sure I don't have any condition, I just could mostly relate to this, it's kind of like constant existential crisis for me, I usually lose track of time and sometimes my body feels numb, like if I was not controlling it anymore, I suddenly get clumsy, whenever I'm not doing anything I get this feeling, even if I am not doing anything for a short period of time, I get these sensation, it's very trippy sometimes, I sometimes see little lights in my eyes or shapes pop up like when you look at the sun and afterwards look somewhere else, and sometimes I get this feeling that I am looking through a screen, like if I wasn't looking through my eyes, however, my description of this sounds pretty bad and serious, but to be honest, I don't think I am at the level that it would be considered a condition, I like to think I am just too day dreamy or bored",0.7563,193

I had this happen to me after my panic attacks and anxiety and nightmares stopped me from sleeping for three whole days after that I had depersonalization. It lasted for a few days and literally was the scariest thing I've ever had. I thought life wasn't real. People around me weren't real. I wasn't real. I felt like I was in a clay built world. That everything was simulated in a video game. Its super scary and I've never forgotten it. I'm so afraid of it happening again. Everytime I smoke weed it happens.

My past and memories don't feel real to me.

It really sucks ass. In a way, I guess it has come in handy - I can think about traumatic experiences and I don't get affected by it.",-0.9293,114
I have Panic Disorder and extreme Emetophobia. Emetophobia is the fear of seeing someone vomit or having to vomit. When I have a panic attack from seeing someone vomit I do go into a state of derealization. It does feel like a dream. In my case it is a lot like a nightmare because everything becomes very bright to the point where I can‚Äôt see anything and I feel very numb all over my body. Noises don‚Äôt really make a lot of sense and at the end of the panic attack all of my body is aching.,-0.9565,107

I used to write a lot but now i just don't think so i can't write (which i used to a lot during the whole 2016).
I have had trouble with my sight too: either focusing (reading or listening or just looking at things) or the light is way too bright for my eyes or way too dark for me. I do wear glasses but it still feels weird and its definitely not usual. I'm starting to become more unaware of my surroundings and just kind of feeling like i'm always inside my head. And... i dont know if i have this. I know i can't self diagnose myself, but i feel it is affecting my life ABSOLUTELY. So...",0.807,194
"I have both, and it's frequently frustrating and overwhelming. Sounds become more muffled, further away and less clear. Surfaces look shinier and disorienting, people, places and myself look and feel more foreign and I have to try and concentrate really hard to focus and feel present, or feel some kind of recognition. It's like watching through a camera lens or a VR and I can react to things as a form of muscle memory but nothing really seems to compute.  It's like sinking into an underwater void where above the water everything feels present and I'm clawing to stay afloat but severely failing and slowly sinking deeper and deeper below the turmoil of the waves. I feel high or slightly drunk or trapped in a dream like trance when I get this way when I never feel fully awake, and when you don't feel present and time does feel off. Lights are a huge issue for me, especially fluorescent and they make me so tired that it's even easier to slip into this state... a state that causes me anxiety and thus makes the feelings worse. It's a vicious cycle that's plagued me for 3 or 4 years now. The sense of hopelessness I feel as a result has flared my anxiety and caused me to feel depressed. My anxiety kicks in while in this state to the point I feel like I need to scream, or run or scratch at my arm to bring myself back but they don't work and I feel so overwhelmed I want to punch a wall or hurt myself to make sure I'm still there... I don't though, otherwise everyone around me would think I was loosing my mind if I started hurting myself. My memory and concentration become non-existent. I develop a horrible brain fog and it makes studying for classes feel impossible. I can't seem to retain anything in lectures because the environment triggers it badly. Even if I manage to study at home, I loose concentration midway through exams and can't seem to read and comprehend anything. I can know something like the back of my hand, but if I try to remember that thing while in this state and can't remember it, then it seems to disappear from my memory altogether.

"I never really like watching videos like these, because i knew i had certain things, but i never wanted to have a discussion on them, but i have to get those thoughts away, Dodie, thank you for addressing this topic, and thank you for making me feel like i am not alone, i've realized (ironically) than i've had Depersonalisation or Derealisation back in around 2013/2014, i was in a church, they were singing the songs, then i suddenly felt lousy and droozy as if i was about to fall, but i wasn't falling, the audio in my ears started blurring also as my vision, but my vision doesn't exactly get blurry, it gets sharper and sharper, and i see a vignette around my vision, and i saw the things, i saw the tables, the chairs, the candles, it seemed like they were all moving and floating, and around me was a progressing void going nearer and nearer, this wasn't a dream, it was real life, i was traumatized.

But i quickly tried snapping myself back in to reality, just kidding, i lied, i just was there, standing, feeling like i was out of reality, this was the case until the mass had stopped and then Me and my mom had to go out, this didn't feel normal, because it wasn't normal for me, it's one of the reason why i don't like going to willingly go to church anymore, every time i go there i associate it with that event, (NOTE: i do go to church whenever a school event happens, or blah blah blah i just don't go myself when it's my decision) i was scared of it, i was scared of getting that sensation again, 

2015, i had it again, then a few months later, again, everything felt like it was without gravity, except for myself, i was getting pulled to the ground as the things around me started to float into the void, i had multiple times, i got used to it, knowing that i don't think it's something i can deal with, since i was a very risk-taker and deal with it type of person, if i was gonna be here for a long time might as well stay for the rest of the time. 

I never attempted to shake it off, to snap back into reality, i only did it the first time and then i resisted, i wanted to stay, because it was different for me, it felt like i was outside of reality, i was amazed but both made terrified by it, but i still didn't want to go, i was just snapped out of it by the other people around me, it felt like i was getting lured in more and more.

No, i cannot pinpoint certain dates on when these happen, but i don't feel like it has a trigger either, it just happens to me, it seems like something is at random times pulling me out of Reality and pulling me into this dream world, 
And no, i don't have ADHD or Autism, i have not been diagnosed with any of those, and nor do i have any other mental disorders or conditions other than the ones mentioned here that i have, i never felt like i was really in reality, it felt like it was all a blur, but i never did get depressed, because i was fascinated by knowing that there might be a way to get out of reality, not because of hardships, but because it was an option to me.

"I suffer from depersonalisation. Back in early 2016 (when I was 15) I started getting uncontrollable health anxiety. I thought I had breast cancer, I thought I had a brain tumour. I went to the doctor and told him and he tested me and he reassured me that I didn‚Äôt have either of those things. I didn‚Äôt believe him and I constantly checked myself, every single day for the symptoms. I was on edge constantly and my mind was no longer rational. There was not a single chance (to me) that I didn‚Äôt have cancer. I was living as though I was in my last days. I went to therapy (CBT) and the therapist didn‚Äôt understand me. She tried to help me to think rationally but it just didn‚Äôt go in, even when I tried. She eventually told me that we‚Äôd ran out of sessions and that I was ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. In about June of 2016, the worried thoughts started to fade, and I felt as though my anxiety had reached its limit and my brain couldn‚Äôt compute any more of it. My head became clouded and my thoughts couldn‚Äôt get through anymore. My entire head became so badly foggy that nothing affected me anymore and everything felt like a dream. I just felt like the words coming out of my mouth and the movements I made were on ‚Äòauto-pilot‚Äô. I lost most of my personality and everything became a blur. I realise now that this was my brain‚Äôs way of saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôve worried to much now, I can‚Äôt function with this level of stress‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs March 2018, and I still feel depressed and as though this life is moving without me, but I‚Äôm more aware of the things I can grab onto. Like my ways of entertainment.

"I'm glad that I found this video now. I've been having these feelings a lot lately, and I'm glad that I now know a name for what I'm feeling.

I stopped going to therapy for my anxiety in late November and I was feeling pretty good... until about a month or so ago. I've been feeling like I'm kind of floaty and like I'm not in my own body. For example, when I pick up my pen to take notes in class, it doesn't feel like it's me holding the pen even though it's clearly in my hand. I also get this feeling sometimes that feels like my head isn't on my shoulders. I've always had not-so-great memory, but it's gotten worse lately, where I can't remember what I said to who and when I said it. Whenever I have an episode like this, it seems almost impossible to focus my vision, and concentrating on what I'm doing is undoable. I also have a tendency to completely zone out and tune out everything that's going on around me.

It really bothers me, but I was convinced that it would go away if I just got more sleep. Needless to say, that didn't work. I tried looking up all of my symptoms trying to find forums or something that talked about it so I could find a name. There were some things that were sort of close, but not close enough. I decided to give up looking for what was wrong with me and just accept it for what it is and hope it goes away. It didn't go away. I've been getting so frustrated over these things that I literally worried myself sick, had a complete mental breakdown, and had to stay home from school for a whole week.

"I've been dealing with derealization for almost 20 years now. It started when I was 11 and I'm 29 now so it has robbed me of pretty much everything. I can't connect to people so I lost all my friends, and while I do crave for romantic love for example, I can't squeeze it out. It doesn't happen. I'm used to it but also deeply saddened by the fact that the (supposedly) bright years in this shell of a body are in the past and I never got to enjoy them.

It never crossed my mind that the difficulties with sight would be another symptom. I can't see well when it's not very bright. Well, I can see, but it's hard to see clearly, my eyes can't focus. Especially when I'm tired. My colleagues curse me putting all the lights on early in the morning, when they like it to be dim before first coffee break. Sorry guys, I need to see what I'm doing. 
Also it's very hard for me to tell what color my eyes or hair or skin are. The more I try to see, the less I actually see it. It's confusing. Doing makeup is difficult because I can't see where I already put it, everything blends together. If I force myself to concentrate on it, I ""forget"" my face - depersonalization.

"Your maneurisms remind me a lot of Charlieissocoollike! Your'e adorable. 

Also I have had this in the past when I had bad anxiety spells that lasts months. It would scare me because I felt like people around me (like my family) weren't real and I would get so scared that this reality would ""turn off"" and I would be stuck in nothingness forever alone. Sometimes I would notice the colours way too much, or background noises in my house felt like a song that was stuck on and I couldn't stop it. I can still freak myself out if I think about it too much! I felt like I had figured out that reality wasn't real and I was stuck with this realization. It was terrifying.",-0.9292,139

"astigmatism is a possibility for the light effect and only seeing dark, severe headaches can also mean a type of migraine that can render people with less or no vision at all during the duration of the migraine. If you had headaches involved during this period of blurred vision and fleeting consciousness then seek a medical professional and look for things you might have an allergy to as this can also lead to similar symptoms as you have described",-0.2614,81

dodie. you have no idea how much this has helped me. i never even knew this existed and i probably never would if it weren't for you being confident enough to talk about this. as i listened to you describe this i realised how much of it applied to me. i searched it up  and found out i do likely have it. finally knowing that i'm not mad  and i'm not alone has helped me so much i can't even put it into words. thank you. i love you. you are amazing.,0.942,101
"for me, i‚Äôve had this for a couple of months now. my derealization/depersonalization started happening after i got a bad sinus infection. strange right? i got fluid in my ears and started having vertigo. which caused my anxiety to go off the charts. my anxiety got so bad that i developed derealization, which i had no clue what that was. so i started researching, and digging around and found that i most likely had that. it would get bad in school, and other places were other people were. i felt like they were robots, and i was the only ‚Äòreal‚Äô person. i felt that i was making them up inside my head or something. but, luckily, i‚Äôve been able to cope with it.

though i‚Äôm not a psychiatrist, i figured out how to get rid of it, or at least calm my anxiety, which was the source. so first, i started meditation. at least spending 10 minutes meditating calmed me and let me have a peaceful mindset. i also found that getting off social media, and getting off my phone, was helpful. and to stop watching these videos, helped not scare me. another thing was, doing things in your life that make you happy. for example, hanging out with your friend, or playing with your pet, can help also. however, everyone is different, but these are some things that i did to get rid of my source of derealization and depersonalization.  
i hope some day y‚Äôall can find peace in your head, and y‚Äôall can get back to doing you. üôÇ",0.9894,316

"one time i was at a store getting groceries with my parents and they got mad at me for something that i can hardly remember now. all i remember is that i thought it was entirely unfair and my brain kind of shut down? the lighting before was sort of bright but after it had a sort of gray tone? i remember my parents talking to me and me kind of just agreeing with everything they were saying. they asked me questions (like normal questions not questions like ‚Äúwhy are you acting weird?‚Äù) and i replied but i don‚Äôt remember thinking of what to say like i usually do. it kind of just came out. after a while they got mad at me for ‚Äúhaving a bitchy face‚Äù but i really couldn‚Äôt help it. i was feeling mad and frustrated and so so confused as to why i was feeling spacey and floaty. as soon as i got home i felt better. sometimes i have very small moments where i hear people talking or i watch my teacher teach and i just don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre saying. i learn the content or whatever but i don‚Äôt fully understand it. usually it happens when there are too many people or everything just feels overwhelming. all those times i‚Äôve felt like that are scary. i cannot imagine how it would feel like to live your life entirely like that. i admire you, dodie. for opening up about this when i hardly ever hear people talking about it.",-0.9773,291

"what this is a thing? all the time, i'll be thinking and then im like wait is this real or am i dreaming? i'll ask people around if its real life, or sometimes pinch myself and i try to compare real dreams i have to how im feeling now to see if it's real life. i don't get the vision problems too often though and if i do it's mostly just things are too bright so maybe i dont even have something similar to this. idk. i cant afford a doctor so im just gonna wait it out, cause it's only happened the last 2 years or so, and i've had a rough past 2 years so maybe it's just stress. im so glad to see that the whole ""This isnt real life"" thing happens to more people though. i really hate even thinking about it.
