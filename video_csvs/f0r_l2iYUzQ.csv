_America is a 1st world nation like Japan. It is more than fair to compared countries, especially when we are getting immigrants from there. America was founded on murder and theft. Or did you not hear what pilgrims actually did. That beings said, naturalization laws contradict immigration laws. I say anyone who is here illegally should NEVER be given a path to citizenship! We have laws to prevent new pilgrims from taking our country from us. I suggest we use them._",-0.479,96

_She is NOT AMERICAN! She is Japanese! Americans do NOT have traditional Japanese Names like that! She was very likely born in Japan and Married into America, or had immigrate parents breaking the laws of America to have her born here..like MOST successful outsiders do. This will NEVER make an outsider an American, no more than it would in Japan. For those thinking it racist to say so, take a trip to Japan. They shit on ALL who aren't Asian, and REGARDLESS of citizenship NEVER accept outsiders as Japanese. You aren't even allowed to stay at some apartments because of your race! Hell half breed native born Japanese aren't acknowledged as Japanese!  America is clearly a melting polt, but if you were NOT born here from US citizens you're NOT American. You're an anchor baby. Success can't change that fact._",0.7454,164

When that fails compare completely irrelevant topics to try to prove your weak ass argument. We've all seen it before. Typical liberalism. Lol Guys like you love being lound and wrong. Being born in America by NON citizens makes you an anchor baby. Immigration laws are enforced in every country but America. Thats exactly why Japan made her choose a country before her 22 bday.
