A good turntable should only do two things:  allow you to enjoy your records and help you care for your records.  Your new Denon TT is very nice!  I like Technics myself of which I have 2...one is a semi automatic direct drive and the other is a fully automatic belt driven.  Your Denon is like a Royals Royce compared to my TTs.  It is stylish while offering features I have not seen nor knew existed in a turntable.  It has been nice to see vinyl and cassettes make somewhat of a strong return.,0.9798,103
"A similar player is the JVC Q-55F, which has a rather unique tonearm (servo-driven): it compensates resonance and wharps in the records. I have been enjoying old LP's, like BIS-LP ""direct metal mastering"" classical repertoire, and it really sounds amazing. However, the digital recordings still sound slightly more crisp.",0.8744,62
"About price. a new belt drive VPI  TItan  IS 40,000 USD so that Technics direct drive is not too expensive it seems now  ...A case with table audiophiles is that they only use manual  tables that are belt driven mostly because they  state that the direct drive motor shaft interferes with the sound by adding rumble. I'd still rather use direct drive because it as far less wow and flutter unless you get a very well made  belt drive table ..If you get a chance ,check out Empire Turntables.",0.7845,95

I'm not fussed about drive type, its mostly the look and operation of the thing that interests me. To get very specific, it would have to be a JVC model.

"Great video, fantastic turntable. I'm surprised you didn't talk more about the microprocessor controlled servo motor arm, which Denon, JVC and most notably Sony were famous for using at the time. These fantastic tonearms vertically and horizontally dampen vibrations from slightly warped records. They inherently make cartridge/tonearm compliance issues a thing of the past as well. I have a Sony PS-X600 TT with the Biotracer tonearm (very much like the servo tonearm in the Denon). Fantastic piece of engineering. Your Denon blows away every single new turntable on the market today - nothing comes close to the sonic advantages of an electromagnetically controlled tonearm. Of course, these can be finicky, as I've had to repeatedly take the Sony into my place of work to service it using all the lab equipment I have available. Microcontrollers and surrounding active components from that era tend to be rather robust (At least the components that Sony chose), but all the passive components do fail, and they can create challenges when viewing results under an oscilloscope. Either way, it is entirely worth the trouble. This technology is essentially porn for an electrical engineer who also happens to be an audiophile :) Cheers! Keep up the great work",0.9798,229

"Hi, I'm a basic patreon contributer (so getting my pennies worth now)   love your posts and gadget talk is  great but also anything hifi, especially retro Hifi. I have a pair of old Tannoy Berkeley's (large peakers) that I got for a very good price but as is usual with these the foam surrounds have perished and will need to buy a re-foam kit. I would love to see you expand the retro hifi elements because like yourself I'm a keen amature not an 'audiophile' and would like to see how you rate various old hifi kit, the kind of things like sound differences between different hifi. I can definitely hear differences between speaker and headphone types but think there's some audio snobbery jiggery-pokery regarding 'special cables' that miraculously (gasps) greatly improve the sonic performance for £1000 per mtr 😉🤔 Also cd players, remember those old things? vinyl is the future apparently according to the yoof of today! well certain early cd players had Philips DAC chips that are classed 'single crown' etc, cd hifi holy grail apparently but did they really make a difference to sound quality?  Your sound quality rating I mostly agree with but under 'good' it covers loads of variances, as an example a friend of mine had Tandy speakers, very weighty compacts, sounded good, then he put on some Wharefdale diamonds and they sounded really good! Like a veil had been lifted off the produced sound in comparison, a more open clear sound etc and thats what I would like more of, from your  personal perspective of good/very good hifi and what you think.....please 'make it so' ( in best captain Picard voice!😁) oh p.s I do sincerely really love that jacket.",0.9984,333

"I could listen to you talk all day about almost anything, tbh, but this one was particularly well timed as I have just bought a record player so I've been learning all about them. It's interesting that I agree with you about most of this video but chose a completely different record player: a Technics SL 1210 Mk2. I wanted a DJ style one and it was that or the Audiotechnica 1240, which is fine, but not a 1200 which is more of a classic. I bought a shop serviced one for a bit of a guarantee of no problems. Random beaten up used ones are cheaper but might have tone-arm bearing problems. And I wanted one that looked nearly new, too.

As for sound quality audiophile stuff, I'm pretty much like you but I'd add two more columns: Really Good, because I can tell and do enjoy the difference between e.g. different cartridges, and Now You're Being Silly, because while I enjoy some audiophile-ness, things like power conditioners and £10,000 record players are somewhere between ""the returns aren't even diminishing any more"" and ""this is made up nonsense"".

"I had a not dissimilar train of thought when I was looking, and I went for the AT-LP120. It's direct drive, first of all, and it's a new TT which even has a year's warranty on top of the obvious support. While it's not got an automatic arm as such, it does have a lever/bar you can use to raise or lower the arm, which works well if you're a bit cackhanded like me. It got good reviews, I think it's gorgeous, and it even has a hinged lid- all due a couple of hundred quid. 

To me, all that mattered was that I could play my records without ruining them, physically or audibly. I don't care if the built in preamp isn't to audiophile standards; it saves me a plug socket and I still think it sounds great.",0.9546,159

If you have a hinged cover and you are picky about sound. Never play your records with the lid on. The needle picks up the reverberation from the echo inside the plastic cover. Every little vibration. Since the cartridge is designed specifically 6to pick up the vibration in the groove. If you have the Genie you have paid a premium to separate the motor from the platter.

"Question, that old stylus was really dirty.  We hear/talk about leaning records often, but what about cleaning a stylus.  I suspect that a good cleaning that old stylus would look and sound as good as the new.  The tippy tip of the old stylus was worn though, you could definitely see that so maybe it won't sound as good as new, but it's been interesting to see/hear and get your take on the before after comparisons.",0.9178,88

"Since my tastes tend to go more towards the 40's through early 60's pre-British Invasion records, I find an old Pioneer PL-112D manual turntable does everything I want it to do.  It's really a matter of what you want the turntable to do.   With very rare exceptions the newer ""turntables"" are more to be relegated to being nothing short of just thrift-store junk made to look like something that is real....mostly plastic and no real attempts at doing anything but making noise.  But, to each his own, I guess.",0.1646,106
"Some people mean, the full vinyl experience comes from putting the tonearm onto the vinyl and back with your own hands, using a manual turntable. I object.
The true vinyl experience includes to dial in the record data into your turntable each time you change record type, to dial in both the speed and the size of the record using two levers.",0.4215,68

"Spot on observation. Nobody my age that I know disliked vinyl. Many of us still bought vinyl when available during the big change to CD, but it never compared to seeing a new LP come out of its sleeve for the first time with all its static electricity, the gatefold artwork, or the first light thump and crackle of the stylus touching it for the first time. You actualy felt like you owned something special. A new LP was a full experience.",0.714,90

"Techmoan Hi there, that was very sound advice regarding cartridges.  I have a Technics SL - 10 fully automatic turntable that works very similarly to you Denon.  The Technics uses the same system to detect the size of the record and shipped with a piece of paper to place over the platter to play translucent records (the Denon system is far more elegant and a neat bit of design).  The SL - 10 and turntable itself is a work of art and there is an example of it in the Modern Museum of Technology.  It is practically the size of a 12” record.  It shipped with a MC cartridge which are better resolution than Moving Magnet but are becoming more increasingly difficult to come by.  For example, my turntable shipped with the Technics 310MC cartridge that is regarded as an excellent cart but the replacement is around £300 - £500 (check EBay) and uses the PMount system.  Unfortunately not many companies make MC cartridges and certainly not to the same quality as the Technics one....  It’ll take a MM cartridge (it has a switchable pre amp built into the turntable) but I did some research and if you can get a MM cartridge for your turntable it’s the best way to go.  Great video as ever!  Also, if anything goes wrong with the complicated automatic turntables, they can be a nightmare to get serviced!",0.9534,262

"Very interesting look into something I've been pondering myself. I also agree with you on your philosophy, I want gear that's good, will last me a while, but I don't see any reason to pay incessant amounts of money for the absolute top notch stuff. Haven't been there yet with vinyl, but for speakers as an example I went with ~500€/pair Yamaha near field monitors, instead of something prohibitively expensive like Genelec, or heaven forbid the ridiculously priced ""proper hifi"" stuff that's out there. The Yamahas sound awesome, are built like tanks, and if their previous monitor speakers are anything to go by will last for decades. I know technically Genelec makes superior speakers, but I also know I wouldn't benefit from them, not enough to cover the price difference (could probably get almost three pairs of the Yamahas for the price of an 8"" Genelec pair).
