Both flamethrowers flame shoots about the same though. anyway if I was going to build either of them I would use your design. Good job",0.664,71

"So I Had This Idea... Awsome.  Thanks - I ran a test of the setup tonight (without the gun shell). I noticed that with the setup the torch flame size was ""okay"" but would flare nicely when the tank laid on it's side. Both valves were opened. The pipes would frost over after a few moments however. Is this flaring (based on the tank changing orientation) somthing you experienced? It appears it is the liquid and the gas difference in the line.
For the Bernzomatic tank connector/regulator knob on the tank connection, did you have to increase the hole size to accomodate more gas flow?",0.8131,123
So I Had This Idea... Thanks for replying. Your project looks great! Hope mine comes out half as good. Pretty easy build so far.,0.9595,29
So I Had This Idea... thank you!,0.4199,9
