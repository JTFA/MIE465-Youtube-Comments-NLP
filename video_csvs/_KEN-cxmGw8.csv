"After discovering about the lawsuit from Tesla, watching the actual review and reading a little bit about it. I am not interested in getting a Tesla anymore... The review of the roadster in my eyes was quite positive, they just said that it has lower range on a race track, which is obvious, to me 50 miles or whatever is still impressive and aparently even tesla calculated that for them. Is lamborghini suying them when they say that the fuel consumption on track is higher? That the brakes broke, well according to what I have read tesla had to change a fuse before they let them drive it on the track again. If they had to change something, it clearly was broken, you do not need to change parts on a working car. Also it is not the first car that broke down during a test, so many of them did and I didnt hear other car companies suying them when they a say BMW electronic diff broke, or a jaguar went to limp mode. And that it is expensive? Well it is a fact, it was more expensive than a comparable petrol car. To me a pretty bad attitude.... Definitely not a tesla fan anymore, silencing anyone who says something bad about your product reminds me of....",-0.7709,240
"Agreed.  Tesla sheep are lost.  Here's the reality.  All the other car manufacturers are on the EV bandwagon and many of them are about to offer cars and suvs that have similar ranges to Tesla.  Now here's the kicker;  All of these car companies are backed by governments (German/Japanese/Korean/Chinese/USA etc) which means #1) they have more resources, #2) they have government backing for infrastructure, #3) they can dump product on the market, saturate it and wipe out competition, #4) they can guarantee quality since they can staff up as many people as they need.   Tesla has done a great thing by changing the playing field but Tesla are akin to Barnsley 4th division now playing against Manchester City 1st division.  It's going to be a blood bath in late 2018/early 2019.  People don't want a shit $35K Car, they want all the extras and reliability.",0.7947,180

How you can tell you're Lying to yourself about tesla.. if you disagree with any of the following.. 1. The build quality and the quality of the materials within are poor even as compared low end petrol cars. 2. Tesla has a very poor reliability rating as compared to other comparable vehicles. This becomes problematic as there are very few places that you can take the car to be fixed and it's known some factory defects you have to live with as tesla will not repair them such as miss matched paint or a steering wheel that is akimbo 3. Unless you have a fast charge station installed at your house you can only get around 30 miles back in charge in 12 hours(120 v vs 240 v). 4. The car is purely a prestige buy. Although ahead of its time it requires a second vehicle unless you never travel 5. You never can get your money back out by calculating the money you save in gas over buying a fuel efficient car.  .... I could go on but if you deny any of the above then there  is no reasoning with you,-0.8873,207
"I LIKE CAKE I LIKE CAKE They are unpractical, because you can't charge anywhere.. there is 2 public charging points in my city.

They are silent and you can't hear them coming, so they will kill pedestrians and cyclists. They don't sound good because they have no engine.
The range is shit and just because they can go 300 miles in California doesn't mean that they work well in -35°C.
They are way too expensive!
You can't fix them at home and you wants to own a car they can't fix themselves.
Making them creates more pollution than using old car and when that old car breaks, then you can fix it. Try fixing car with few hundred high voltage batteries by yourself at home.

if you learn about electric car you will now that they are not new in fact about 100 years ago they made electric cars but because they burn the batteries compare to petrol engine people left the electric car for petrol because it was more reliable and big companies saw a future with petrol engine and not so much with electric.
