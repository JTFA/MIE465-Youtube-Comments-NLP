"Bullying is so serious especially for a child that has to go through it. soem people dont let it bother them but others it can drive them to hurt themselves or even sucide or even leave life long scars  for them to remember. I once went to college and saw a bunch of kids around the same age as these in the video giving  a boy a hard time and most of it was just females harrassing him.  when I first saw this I brushed it off thinking he either done someing or said soemthing to them. But over the course of a few weeks I noticed it would continue I asked a few of my friends  if they knew why they were doing it noone seemed to know, I knew  he stayed behind after school  on Mondays to wait for a lift home. so I took one of my classess off and went to the steps and spoke with him while he waited for his lift home. I learned they were just harassing him but I could see it was seriously affecting him. when he got in his car I told him dont worry I will see to it that it ends. the mother looked at me  but I dont think she knew what her son was seriousuly going through. 

the next morning me and several of my friends went over to the school early and stood by the gates waiting. he walked up and a bunch of the kids started yelling  and some threw stuff, I  caught one of the objects being thrown and turned to face them all and so did my friends, the boy was standing behind us and I said anyone throws anything at him and it will be us they deal with, my friends all folded there arms looking at them some were shocked and  some didnt seem to take much notice of the warning I gave, two of them said we will get you tomorrow to the boy.

before I could reply  one of my friends did instead saying. Yes you may get him tomorrow.....but we will get you  the day after that and the next day and every day if you bully him anymore. a few of them backed off leaving some teachers even came out and was wondering what is going on to which I said your students here are nothing but ungrateful Bastar*s that enjoy bullying this one. Teachers didnt seem  to listen. 

so I told the boy to go to class and if anything happened to tell me or my friends. he went off to class and I went back to college. after a few classess the bell rings for his lunch and we have ours at the same time as them  ((except our lunch break is obviously alot longer then teres)) so we once again headed back to the school  a bunch of the students there were shocked to see us  again so suddenly  and we sat outside with the boy and had our lunch with him and waited  for him to get his lift home each day, we done this for the rest of the school year for him, once we left college as we finished for good he still had 2 more years left in his school. we didnt know what to do so we got together and came up with a solution for the boy. I drove down to his parents house and told them what I knew and everything that has happened. the father and mother thanked me and my friends so I gave them my phone number and I gave the number to the boy aswell  for safe keeping, we told him if he needed our help again to give me a ring.

5 years later I get a phonecall from the boy hes mid way through high school  this was out of the blue for me and I was not expecting him to ring. but we got talking and he thanked me for everything, I  spoke with my friends  again and we decided to drive down to his high school just to see him. we parked our cars outside accross the road and waited to see him come out,

what I saw was brillant, he was not only standing up to bullies but he was standing up to bullies for someone else who was being bullied I know this because he was standing between three people and another boy that was down on the ground. but before I could get out to offer my help some of his new friends circled around him to help the boy out. I stayed in the car and so did my friends, once the scene was over the boy got in my car and we spoke I asked what that was all about. he said just wanted to help my friend out the same way you helped me out  all them years ago. 

the boys now finished his college and became a teacher to stop bullying in school that was the last I heard of him and I know where ever he teaches them students will have a dam good teacher to look out for them who knows what that boy would of endured or what his life would be now if we or anyone didnt stand in for him. I wish all bullying stops but sadly I know it wont happen I dont want to think of what that boy or anyone else would endure if people dont step in and help them",0.9946,976
