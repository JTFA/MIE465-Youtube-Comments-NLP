"""deserves to be trending""
What deserves to be trending? Only things you believe to be good enough? How is that quantified? I believe this is the point of having a trending algorithm.
I don't know why or how this got into trending, but I don't care, and neither should you. It's a young algorithm that I'm sure will get better over time (as machine learning does).
I do know that you commenting only bolsters its activity, so the best way to show your disdain is not to comment at all.",0.8366,104
