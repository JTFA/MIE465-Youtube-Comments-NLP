46:44 No the extra money for EAP (enhanced autopilot) is just for the software. The sensors will be included regardless. (You can actually buy EAP whenever you like.). I think even without EAP the sensors will be in constant use for some safety features.,0.1531,53

"Good news, there is one less person on the Tesla Model 3 waiting list ahead of you.  The dreaded ""clean, uncluttered"" touch screen interface that doesn't give you a single hint of where anything is.  You have to know how to do the command before you start.  So you will NEVER know 90% of the features.  Let's see I want to roll down the back window.

airpods never have a delay with video. not on windows laptop or ipad or android phone. They don't cram into your ear canal and just sit comfortably in your ear shell. They are light. The case is small. Please show me a better alternative. It doesn't exist. Degauslabs have a wired version of the airpods that you can wear around your ear because they don't have the ''stick''. Those 2 are a great combination for those that want to ''forget'' they have something in their ear.,0.924,103
