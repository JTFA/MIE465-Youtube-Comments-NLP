"BoubbieVagee BoubbieVagee Thank you.  I understand your response, and appreciate the ""informed"" response.  However, I can't help but wonder if you are either uninformed, or intellectually dishonest.  
First of all, Jews were the slave traders who shipped the Africans to Americans.  So it is former slave traders poking fun at my expense (not a former American slave btw), but it is still obviously wrong and offensive.  
Secondly, almost every race has been the victims of slavery, genocide, and oppression.  Your claim that ""white people"" have done most of it shows you haven't looked at history, considered humanity's past at all, or you really think only white peopel do those things (google Holodomor, Mao, Pol Pot, Eastern European slaves, etc.). Perhaps not everyone has experiences these things ""as a minority"", but does that really give 1-3% of a population the right to be the ""culture police"" of America?  We should laugh at what we find funny, not the programming that they tell us is ok to laugh at.  It worries me that your answer seemingly blames white people for humanities' worst atrocities, and therefore should be made fun of.  Do you happen to donate to Israel?",-0.8266,238
BoubbieVagee We didn't address the genocide in  Africa in the 1900s. African against African.The war in the Congo over 3 million died all African on African.Now the current war in the Southern Sudan.It's time too learn truthful history not some American Afro racist nonsense.Please understand all race's on this planet  earth are equal in both great kindness or unspeakable horrors.,-0.875,64

"for me, its cus jews have gone through a terrible tragedy while being a minority. so they can joke because they know they real pain. to my knowledge white people have not been enslaved, oppressed or been at the wrong side of genocide. they have for the most part, majorly been on the side causing the pain. so when white people try to comment on cultural idiosyncrasies, they come from a place of not experiencing the true pain so it comes off as poking  fun at your expense more than anything. just think if a slave owner tried to make light jokes and comments about how hard it is to be a cotton picking slave. now im not equating all white people to slave owners, it was just an extreme example to get the point across. if you dont know the pain, you can't joke about it.. especially when your fore fathers (if youre white) caused it.
