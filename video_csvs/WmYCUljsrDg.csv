"Jesus dude, how in the hell can you do this. I'd give anything to have those skills. That little house in the wilderness with a garden during the summer and a stream for water and the clothing on my back is all that I would ever need for the rest of my life. I could live there solitary or with one other person and it would never bother me for the rest of my life. That is the way to live no doubt about it. modern life sucks, yes it's convenient but it's not healthy. People think they need to have bars and alcohol and all that stuff to have fun and you don't need it at all. All you need is to have your dog as a companion or a fellow human that's not an a******, and that's all you need as long as you have food water shelter and clothing. This is what I strive for, but of course the home will have to be one of those prefab many homes cuz I'll never be able to build what you just did.
