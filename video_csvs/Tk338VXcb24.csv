"After the Falcon Heavy launch, Elon Musk jokingly said in an interview that aliens would wonder why they put a small car inside a big car in space and then wonder what were people thinking. If beings from other worlds did exist (I honestly don‚Äôt think they do), they would not ask that question. They would rather wonder why people had put such a complicated vehicle with round wheels and rubber tires made from trees into space.... a road vehicle that is totally dependent on gravity and roads (more than 100 year old technology), but they still have not discovered the technology to counter gravity. I think that would confuse them even more.",-0.09,127

"Guys calm down about ""Elon throwing space junk that will last for billions of years"". The size of that car compared to space is miniscule. Let's compare it with the ocean. So that's 360000000000m¬≤/8m¬≤ which is 45000000000. Yeah so you need that much to cover the ocean's surface with cars. For comparison, we only have around 1015000000 cars on earth. and to cover the solar system with cars you need um, idk œÄ*4500000000000000¬≤/8 cars (none of my calculators could count the result). And all of that is fit in a disk less than 2 meters tall. To fill in the whole solar system. It'll take something like 3/4*œÄ*90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/16.
