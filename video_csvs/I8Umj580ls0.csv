"JamesHLanier   SLIGHTLY liberally biased?? Even liberals typically admit the media and Hollywood are very liberally biased.  Again, research has been conducted but setting that aside, it’s completely obvious.  

And as far as the specific issues I’m tired of being bombarded with, I think that’s a bit too big of a question to answer on the comment section on YouTube.  I don’t think it’s too much to ask our news organizations to present unbiased facts without the dose of their liberal or conservative opinions.  Present facts and let the people make up their own minds.  Don’t use your position as a reporter to soapbox rant about your political views. It’s extremely misleading, unethical, & unprofessional.  

And is it too much to ask Hollywood actors and celebrities to stay in their lane?  They are all obsessed with trying to push their views cuz they are so bitter their candidate didn’t win. But people see what they’re doing and will vote Trump again because no one likes having someone else’s political views consistently and manipulatively shoved down their throat.

"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, my friends!

Jesus LOVES YOU!

The Lord came down from heaven to die, and 3 days later, rise again for all of us!
He did this out of sheer Love for us all!

Jesus does not hate you, and He is not angry at you.

The Word says that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16 paraphrased)

So friends, repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He will help you in whatever you are going through!
He will forgive you, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth.

Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come  to Him! (John 6:37 paraphrased)

So come to Jesus today!
Don't let anything stop you from seeking Jesus!

You don't need a fancy long prayer to make Jesus your Lord and Savior, just speak from your heart.
Be real with Jesus.
You don't need a lot of faith, either. A mustard seed size faith is good enough for The Lord!

All those that call upon The Lord will be saved! (Romans 10:13)
Hallelujah! 

Shalom, friends!",0.9954,242
"The Miami Herald is now reporting that the killer did not even use an ‘assault weapon’ by the definition of the old Federal 1984 Assault Weapon ban. He used a ‘compliant’ S&W version which did not have the ‘evil cosmetic features’, and only used 10 round magazines. In fact, most likely the firearm would have been legal to sell during 1984 to 1994 period of the Federal Assault weapon ban.

"Trump actually DID do something like this.  He was in his limo in New York and saw a man being beaten with a baseball bat.  He told the driver to pull over against Melania's protests.  He got out alone, unarmed and asked the man to stop.  The man looked at him and stopped, and walked away.  Trump got the victim an ambulance.  So I believe Trump would have done the same thing again, knowing his well being or  maybe his life was at risk.  How many would have just driven by?  Most.  Google the story.  It's true.

"Yes, slightly. Only slightly when we're talking about main stream media. The truth is that most conservative viewpoints have gone so far right that they see moderation as extremism. 

I agree that new reporters should only report on facts. I don't think major news networks should have opinion shows at all. It only misleads people.

This next bit I don't agree with you on. Why can't celebrities voice their opinions? You're free to voice yours as well. There's this common thing that happens when you hear an opposing viewpoint. You automatically think it's being pushed down your throat. I'm guilty of it too. When I hear someone say they would never get an abortion, my knee jerk reaction is that they are against women's reproductive rights. However, that's not necessarily the case. They could just not want one personally. We all have to step back and realize not everything is meant to be a personal attack or a direct imposition on your free will. (Please let's not get into abortion. It was just an example)

The Young Turks are the most liberally biased source I've ever seen. I can't believe I forgot to mention them. They're basically the Fox News of the left. The View isn't a news source, but to say that a liberal can't beat a conservative on an equal playing field is a bit of a generalization don't you think? Both liberals and conservatives win and lose against each other all the time. What really matters is the content of the discussion.",0.8481,284
