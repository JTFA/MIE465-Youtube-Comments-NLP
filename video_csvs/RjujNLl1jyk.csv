"(((We are all in a Spiritual battle for our SOULS!!!)))

***There is an ongoing Spiritual battle for all of our SOULS! And all of us are being used as guinea pigs for SATAN and you don‚Äôt even know it! 

*** But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and (((SORCERERS))), and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Revelation 21:8). 

(Sorcery=Pharmakeia in the Greek Language=Pharmacy=DRUG USERS! 

This is a freewill open door portal, to allow them to come into your body/temple of every foul and unclean Spirit/Demon. Your freewill choice‚Äôs gives them the access so they can take it over). 

*** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul. (Proverbs 8:36). (So when you are sinning against God you are sinning against your own Soul. 

*** abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. (1 Peter 2:11). (Lust is a name of a Demonic Spirit. Just like the Spirit of Anger, Homosexuality and Pride etc. 

***Now with this CERN/The Devils Portal being opened up in the name of, ‚ÄúScience‚Äù, this world is becoming HELL which, the Baphomet/Satan wants as his saying goes, ‚ÄúAs above, so Below.‚Äù This is why you need to put the Blood of Jesus all over yourselves and your family members. And by showing Jesus you love him by obeying his commandments‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

***(Jesus): You will know the truth and the truth will set you free. (John 8:32). (Set you free from what??? Demonic Spirits!!! Submit to God and Resist the devil and he will flee from you!!! (James 4:7). 

*** And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. (Luke 10:17).

***Keep in mind, God will not allow Demonic Spirits to destroy mankind. Demonic Spirits, through mans freewill, is the only way they can cause harm to us and make us hurt or destroy our selves. Jesus, my king and hopefully your king as well, has them on a short leash or they would destroy the earth if they got the chance. 

***Remember, Demonic Spirits are inter-dimensional beings with alien bodies. Case in point, ‚ÄúThe Greys‚Äù, are the working bees of SATAN!!!

*** For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (Ephesians 6:12).",-0.9695,568

It depends on the brand and/or style of rice you are seeking. For example short grain nishiki rice you don't rinse cause some recipes like sushi and rissotto  needs the stickiness of unwashed. Also a lot of American rice is 'enriched' and washing it will remove the nutrients.Basically what I've noticed from experience is that a lot of people learned from their parents to wash rice because their parents washed rice back in their homeland where it wasn't as clean or still processed with additives like being milled with things like talc so it was a habit to rinse it off always and they teach that to their kids or the kids see them washing it and learn the habit. Nowadays it's not milled that way anymore in America and the USA rice federation says it's not required to wash american produced rice because it's clean and packaged. There are laws the rice companies have to follow along with quality/health inspections. Which explains why u.s.a  rice cooking instructions on the package doesn't even say to wash it. Rule of thumb is to always wash imported rice though because their production standards/conditions may differ.,0.4559,212
It depends. Every one has different tastes. But I think sriracha was the best choice for this dish. Sriracha has sweet heat to it but it‚Äôs not spicy. It leans toward the mild side.,0.5574,41

"rollercoaster24 Your upset that one of them went to culinary school and decided to use pre-made sauces. You assume they don‚Äôt know how to make the sauces from scratch  which is an assumption on your part. For the purposes of the video, target audience or even just because they might prefer pre-made sauces shouldn‚Äôt detract from the usefulness of the video or recipes. Besides using pre-made sauces are fine, some of the finest kitchens and chefs use them. Worcestershire sauce has long been used as has dashi etc. You or I might prefer and have the time to prepare sauces from scratch but a lot of people would rather grab some pre-made teriyaki sauce and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. The dish is probably very tasty and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most important.",0.7641,151

That would be a completely different dish and not at all what they‚Äôre going for. You‚Äòre not as culinarily educated as you think you are. This is a layered dish, not a stir fry.",0.0,43
Í∞±ÏÉù not bad for dudes from the hood cooking with Asian flavours.  Most importantly is you can see their passion for food and having fun unlike some chefs who really hate being the kitchen.,0.775,36
