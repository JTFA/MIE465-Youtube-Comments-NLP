"1. Betty's long lost bro is actually FP's son because obviously Alice sported a double life and was a secret serpent. Probs cheated on Hal with FP and told Hal she was pregnant with Hal's baby and broke up with FP.
2. Betty is going to have a fling with Sweet Pea. Possibly while she's being a cam girl. I think this is going to happen because when she was stripping on the pole, the camera focused on him for a few seconds with a smile, and no one else was on screen with him.",-0.3612,104

I believe they haven’t caught the black hood bc Archie didn’t get an answer from agent Adams. And really it’s Betty’s dad bc if he was watching her mum she could probably see him bc it’s a window ffs. And Hal is spending time with mother blossom (forgot name) who was the wife of the ex sugar man. Also Cheryl threatened her mum about telling everyone what really happened in the barn so maybe Cheryl’s mum in on it too. Plus Betty’s mum didn’t want Betty being friends with Archie jug or Veronica and they are victims of the black hood or Betty’s “doings”. Also Hal has green eyes,-0.6908,136

Chick is the black hood.their is a lot of proof for this like in one episode

Ok are y’all ready for this. Ok so Betty will find out the black hood is a group and her brother is in it because the parents sinned him by giving him away. So........ Betty will join the black hood group to be there for her brother. This is based off of the end of season 1 when she was holding the hood. Maybe the web camming is just a step into the darkness,0.8176,81
Ok but they didn't deny the Alice and FP son theory ....,0.486,12
Ok so Veronica and Jughead totally belong together. Remember when Jughead and Archie came to Pops and Veronica and Betty were already there. Jughead could have sat next to Betty but no he sat next Veronica sooooooo...,-0.296,40
Ok so do u know of a deleted scene where Alice and Hal invite jughead to stay with them after Bettys speech In 1x13 well you know how Jughead and FP were going to get  Kicked out of the trailer. Then bughead came back. Well maybe then something will happen and jughead will move in with Betty. Also FP will move in with Alice and Betty so falice can be Real to. Ps that is not incest,0.7184,81
Okay so I definitely don’t believe the the Black Hood is Dead. I think that the real Black Hood really did kidnap the janitor (I forgot what his name was) and threatened to hurt the kids (especially Josie because he seemed a little too protective of her) so he was made to go to where the grave was.,-0.8558,66
