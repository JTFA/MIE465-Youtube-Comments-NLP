"@Big A   I am just pointing out reality. Capitalism is an unstable, anti democratic top down organisation of people that concentrates wealth and political power from that wealth into ever fewer hands.

2 crashes in 75 years with 11 downturns in between and a western population that hasn't seen consistent above inflation wage rises in decades. Given 1% of the global population owns 60% of all shares accounting for 80% of the value of all shares, the stock market is a measure of how well the rich are doing investing a portion of the rising wages no longer given. 

The other part of those wages once paid out to the few at the top via dividends ends up being managed by hedge funds who loan to banks who loan those wages in the form of credit to workers on condition of full repayment with interest.

"THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS DUTY-BOUND TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY. I believe that its House and Senate  representatives are neglecting this supremely important duty. Practically every day, Trump has been ‚Äúcalling the tune‚Äù and they obediently dance to it. He has set the Dems and the Reps at odds over practically anything and everything, while falsely calling for unity and bipartisanship. The Dems must forget about bipartisanship because Trump will undermine it all the way. In fact, they must ignore the Republican Party completely because it just doesn't count any more. Trump now owns the GOP lock, stock, and barrel, body and soul. The Dems one and only target for any chance of a decisive victory against the enemies of our democracy must be Trump himself.

The mid-term elections are make-or-break time for the Democratic Party, and also for our nation. If Trump's lackeys regain control of both House and Senate, Trump is well on the way to destroying our democratic institutions and way of life. How are the Dems going to respond to this huge challenge? I suggest the only way to defeat Trump is to completely ignore his daily agenda and his ‚Äútunes‚Äù, and ruthlessly attack his character flaws and defects. He has a truckload of both, and they are spectacular ones. Two weapons that should be used in this battle are widely-distributed information leaflets and frequent face-to-face meetings with the electorate. The fight must start now; the Democratic Party must produce a battle plan and stick to it, avoiding distractions. Are the Dems up to the job?  They had better be; the future of our country, the future of our children, now depends on them. Supreme Leader Donald Trump is looming on the horizon.",-0.7713,323

"The massive fall on the DJ index happened largely due to inflation, in part caused by rising interest rates. The rise in inflation is further strengthened by these tax cuts.
