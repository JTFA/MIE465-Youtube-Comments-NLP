"I am an android user (Samsung S8)  but this is hands down the best review of any phone I have ever seen.  I still have some fundemental issues with the way Apple prices their products,  But there is no denying that the the Apple iPhone 10 is an excellent phone.   Show by the way is the Google pixel XL and the Samsung S8.     As Stallman points out,  We consumers have an embarrassment of riches to deal with.

I‚Äôm okay to switching to the x for now since I have the iPhone forever plan. But watching your review sir? Hands down you did superb job,0.9064,88
I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm lost. I‚Äôm a fellow photographer. Also a fellow owner of the iPhone X. I sat through this entire  video without even hearing a word of RAW capabilities. Did I miss it?  Not sure why but that just confuses me.  A straight up photo taken with lightroom mobile is significantly and visibly sharper at 100% than the stock app. Don‚Äôt compare dynamic range until you‚Äôre using mobile apps that support raw.

Not sure how often you view your comments Tyler. Great video and you seem to have done a really great in depth review. I wonder if you have come across an issue with red eye when using flash on low light situations with the X. I've seem several posts on forums with similar people that have the X having this problem. I never had this problem and some people feel that it can be due to the flash being so close to the lens. You're definitely a pro so I wanted to get your perspective.https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8234737 .   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8202465 . https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7ig42s/iphone_x_red_eye_problem_anyone_else_noticed_this/,0.7305,107
