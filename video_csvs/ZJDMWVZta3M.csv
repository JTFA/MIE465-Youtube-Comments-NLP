"I've been waiting for the movie as long as everyone else. However the trailer dissapointed me. It looks as it they just reversed the first movie with a bit of Jack Jack Attack. Of corurse  in this way, they follow the politically correct tendency of Hollywood, making Elastic Girl take the lead. Something that Pixar needs considering John Lasseter was accused of sexual harassement. So far not very original plot",-0.7564,77
