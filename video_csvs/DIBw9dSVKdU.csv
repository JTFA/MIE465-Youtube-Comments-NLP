"The thing about this vs. The Emoji Movie: When Wreck-It Ralph first came out, it seemed pretty original. Soon though, the Emoji Movie came out and decided to borrow many elements from Wreck-It Ralph, but in terms of the Smart Phone. Smart Phones have the internet, so The Emoji Movie went to the Internet. Wreck-It Ralph 2 decided to come out, taking the characters to the internet. But the internet world inside your electronics¬†has already been done by the Emoji Movie. But the world inside your electronics had already been done by Wreck-It Ralph first. So, Wreck-It Ralph is first, but the Emoji Movie beat them to it. Wreck-It Ralph 2 would not be taking off of the Emoji Movie if the Emoji Movie hadn't taken off of Wreck-It Ralph in the first place.",0.8705,152
