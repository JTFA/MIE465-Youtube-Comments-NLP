"Am I the only one who doesn’t remotely understand the conflict in this movie? 

They can just stay the fuck in doors during the day.... how is that such a problem for the relationship? Wtf... 

...which means that the crux of this movie is going to have to be whiny teenage insecurity around her not wanting to even tell him that she sunburns really, really easily. Which will make for a dumb movie with a forced miscommunication between the two of them and a contrived reconciliation at the end. 

I will be SHOCKED if it goes any other way.",-0.9518,109
