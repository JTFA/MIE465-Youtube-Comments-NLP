So I can type it all up if anyone's interested but basically the alternator belt broke and the mainsail was not able to go up as we would have capsized no doubt about it. So only the jib was up however that was getting hammered really badly. So cut a long story short we radioed the coast guard as we we where 4h away from port and asked them to stand buy for any major SOS messages that could possibly come through, it turned out that a navy vessel was doing patrol around harwich port and was tasked in assisting us if needs be as they where far closer and in a more capable ship.
