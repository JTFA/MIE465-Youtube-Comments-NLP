"Aaron Petersen A vocal minority of people are mostly finding this disrespectful because Prince made it clear to his loved ones that he never wanted his likeness to be presented as a hologram. It was rumoured that Prince would appear as a hologram during the halftime show and one of his family members (or close friend, I forget) opposed the use of the hologram for the reason stated above. Justin Timberlake and other parties then consulted with the family and got their blessing for how they would pay tribute to Prince and his legacy on stage. The vocal minority internet complainers (not Princes family or friends) are upset because they think that a 2D projected image is still a hologram and thus going against Princes wishes. But they simply don’t know what a hologram is. So people are getting upset on behalf of Prince for no other reason in that they don’t understand what a word means.",0.7964,172

You suggested the possibility that Prince said that he didn’t want his likeness to be used. To back that up, you provide no sources, yet maintain that he was disrespected. Fact checking your claim, I discovered that he did in fact disclose to loved ones that he didn’t not what to be a hologram. He was not portrayed in that manner here. Prince’s family, whom know Prince better then both of us, gave JT and other parties involved, their blessing to do what they did.

I thought it was pretty good, actually. And this is coming from a guy who was impressed with Prince since he 1st came out back in 1977-78 era, and have followed  him ALL the way thru to 2016. 
But of course Prince has an edge on virtually every performer out there in live stage shows today.
Of course it's his standout genius in poetry, song writing, concepts, and almost incomprehensible musicianship and his commanding prescence. There is something else to the formula. His unbeatable live shows. Once, when my wife and I asked him what his ""formula"" is for developing such riveting concerts, his answer revealed his humility and his mastery over the business.
""That formula that you speak of,"" he answered, ""Really isn't anything that you couldn't do with a handful of guests in the privacy of your own home"".
I objected because I can't play  a musical instrument to save my life!
""You don't have too, all you have to do is have your audience in mind when you invite them over, and get them to enjoy themselves"".
So simple, so logical. An answer you would expect from a dude who was one of the greatest musicians and live stage performers in the history of modern music.

Then why’d you come watch it?,0.0,9
There's a difference between a projection and a hologram. It's basically a projection of a youtube video. I highly doubt prince would care if people watched an old live performance of him on youtube. This is exactly the same,0.1045,42

"They will never be as good as the original, but that was pretty outstanding",0.8945,15
"This doesn’t go against his wishes. It as just a projection which Prince never said he as against. This is how most artist tributes go. Prince was not against tribute performances, just holograms.",0.1531,40
This is not news... no one cares,0.5978,8
"This was a fantastic duet between Timberlake and Prince.  Prince only cared about creating and evolving his music, which making a duet of this fantastic song is the ultimate homage to the legendary artist.",0.9042,37
This was a very touching moment on a good halftime show. The only bad part of this was that really wierd intro JT did coming out the club at the beginning. If you're not a fan of this you're drinking the Prince family koolaid and you would probably be the ones to say you loved this if Prince actually said he wanted a hologram in public,0.641,68

"When I say ""I'm"" That refers to me (Hurech Rough) and when I say ""Ignorant""  That refers to you (Daniel Bergeron.) You need to pay attention to the way the words are laid out or else you'll keep appearing to look like a dumbass.

Is JT paying you to type this garbage as damage control? The only way I'd come on here and try to look as stupid as you is if I were getting Timberlake money.",-0.7556,89

"Yenpoxdevotchka 

Why JT dressed like he auditioning for Duck Dynasty?",0.6289,11
Yenpoxdevotchka do you have any evidence for your supposed facts? JT consulted this tribute with Prince’s family and they approved it. They said no hologram and agreed on what you see in this video. Semantics are important. A 2d video projected is not a hologram. Thus they did not go against Princes wishes. If Prince would have that otherwise he would have said it. Price is not an idiot.,0.8568,79
Yenpoxdevotchka it wasn't a hologram it was a background video. Chill out.,0.0,14
"Yenpoxdevotchka sure as hell didn’t!! His friends as he called them ( because he didn’t use the term fans any longer, because he didn’t consider people that loved his music fanatics ) would see he was 100% against his image being used, even his voice. All they have to do is Google his interview!!! It’s amazing how people don’t respect the living or the dead. And his family knew as well. I put the blame on them!!!! Lighting up the city.. cool. But if he left his wishes, just respect it!!!!",0.9212,121
