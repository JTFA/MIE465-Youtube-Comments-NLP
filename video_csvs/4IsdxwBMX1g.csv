"You are one ignorant, ugly, asinine mother fucker, Mod Sun. I have never heard you do or say shit that ever helped anyone. You promote drug usage to children and dress it up as some bullshit, good natured, free love bull crap. You're a wanna be charles manson, but at least manson had integrity and admitted he doesn't give a fuck about anyone but himself. You're a scuzzy self-righteous stoner who makes horrible music and has to be high all the time just to maintain your bedlamite persona. Your girlfriend is the product of such airhead behavior and mentality and drug usage, and she should be working in sewage to help clean up santa barbara for being so insensitive and narcissistic. You're both disgusting narcissists. Maybe next time you can have your concert in a mudslide since you piggish people love to roll and eat dirt anyway.
