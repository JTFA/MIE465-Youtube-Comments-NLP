"""You know I want you 
It's not a secret I try to hide I know you want me 
So don't keep saying our hands are tied 
You claim it's not in the cards
But fate is pulling you miles away 
And out of reach from me 
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide 

That you're my destiny?
What if we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine 
Nothing could keep us apart You'd be the one I was meant to find It's up to you, and it's up to me 
No one can say what we get to be 
So why don't we rewrite the stars? 
Maybe the world could be ours

But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?
