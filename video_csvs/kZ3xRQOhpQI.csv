Up until they brought up the point why women weren’t on money, well here we go with either a Nother left this bullshit about Hillary Clinton or some other reason with the wage gap. And just to let everyone now it is illegal to pay a woman a lesser wage then a man the only reason the wage gap exists so to say is because women do not take on full-time jobs and take maternity leave as well as multiple other reasons. I hated how this video became political at the very end I thought it was educational but it turned out to be a brain watching video. I can’t believe this crap.
