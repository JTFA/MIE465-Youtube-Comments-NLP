"Alyssa, I absolutely love you. U should have millions and millions of subs. Ur videos are the best and I mean that whole heartedly. I like the content and quality of your work. Ur looks are flawless and beautiful.  I found u through watching a couple Jackie Aina vlogs and I was like let me see if she’s a YouTuber too. I am so glad I found u! I’m binge watching all of ur old videos trying to catch up. I love ur Brush Bootcamp series.  U r very refreshing. I’m learning that there is a lot of drama in the beauty industry (especially from YouTubers) but u seem to fly above it all. Keep up the good work.",0.9689,140
