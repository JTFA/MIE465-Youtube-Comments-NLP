We are very good at observing and pointing out the other's behaviour but seemigly not so keen on doing  the same with ourselves. It is so easy to be the judge of another's faults and childish responses and yet we fail to see our own. When will this take place? To be responsible for one's own selfishness, lack of responsibility, and so on? I read people here always blaming someone. But not themselves. Are we so righteous then? Most likely the people you are pointing your finger at will be pointing the finger at you. I cant be sure on this but this seems to be so often the case.

"I see daily patents in relationship's described in this video. Loneliness and failed relationships is one of the biggest problems of our times and from my experience what you describe in your video shows very well and accurately why. Obviously the biggest problem is the lack of self-awareness, many of the patents from childhood can be hidden so well that we simply don't recognise them. I certainly went through number of relationships which looking back were reflecting what I learned to expect emotionally from a relationship. The relationships looked completely different but today knowing what I know I can see clearly that on an emotional level they were exactly what I saw/felt between my parents. I respect your opinion about how to deal with this problem and hugely disagree also :-) I changed many of the patents I inherited from my childhood and my entire life has transformed. None of the men I was previously with would ever allow me to be who I am today simply because they were and are weak and no matter how great you learn to deal with weak person, they are who they are and they will alway affect your life (unless they choose to change). I have been now in the most incredible relationship for almost a decade. My husband is as strong as I am and since we met, we have catapult each other into a stratosphere in every area of our lives, because this is what happen when two strong and positive energies are in sync. Your advice is great for people who look for an improvement but not for those who are  are seeking the best possible outcome, which I personally believe should be our goal in 21st century.

It becomes difficult when one or both parties lack the skills to negotiate. One party mistakenly allows the other to be ""difficult"" in the relationship and the problems stagnate because you do not insist on their resolution.",0.2732,100

But it has nothing to do with love, it has to do with LEARNING everything! Parents and also friends, teachers, books and lots of movies and experience will effect the pattern behind choosing our partner!!!Never ever settle for anything less then mutual understanding, respect and sexual attraction.",-0.872,189
This is honest to god one of the only videos I have ever gone of out my way to hit dislike on YouTube and the comment section reflects that,0.4215,29
"This is one view on relationships, but I can say in my case it was true. 
I stayed in a very abusive and troubled relationship or over 4 years, and I can't only blame my ex partner.
I was childish and kept wanting different responses and attention from someone who clearly was only putting up with my for their own purposes. 
I blamed myself, for not being loved enough, for not being wanted enough, when none of that were in my hands.
But I think these relationships, even though makes us suffer, are extremely important in our personal growth and for us to have healthier relationships in the future.",-0.9288,121

"This video has some good ideas and probably some thigns that would work but he talks like this is how EVERYONE works. Which I guess is due to the style of the video.

I wince in fear when my partners angry at something and raises his voice, its almost never ever directed at me but i think its the association from my childhood. I feel lonely and/antsy when my partner spends long periods of time on the computer gaming because my mother was absent from us often when she was studying as a single mother. Wow its depressing to think that this is all still with me",-0.5864,106

"What a psychoanalytic bs! I know so many people who actively avoiding people, who have similarities to their ""broke parents"".

"What about if you're a loyal, caring, faithful partner to a pathological lying heroin addict? How do you reason with someone with that problem in the way it is explained in this video? I WISH the problem was that he is overbearing... I could deal with that. But when it comes to sneaking around and hiding his using from me, I don't know what to do and can't seem to leave after multiple attempts. How do you fix that kind of ""broken""?",-0.2404,93
"What about people who are attracted to others based solely on superficial traits? I have no shame in admitting this is true for me. It took me ages to realise that my relationships fail because I just like how a person looks, their body language, voice, intelligence etc, and then find myself stuck in a relationship because of my insecurities or confusion because I happen to also like their character. But that just means we're friends, and having sex with friends isn't a good idea :D

What I'm saying is that I'm obviously not drawn to people who remind me of childhood models... I'm not really drawn to people at all, as more than friends anyway. I'm drawn to their hotness, not them. Some people are sexually attractive but pursuing that tends to be more trouble than it's worth. So yeah, not at all convinced by any this. I never ""picked"" a partner. They just kinda... appear. And I can't be the only one. Am I?",-0.2077,189
