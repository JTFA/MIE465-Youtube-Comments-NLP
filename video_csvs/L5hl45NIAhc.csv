Christopher Michael to me that's the kind of stuff need to get over. If you don't like someone because of the race or the nationality man they got it all wrong. Look at Suarez he held off Truex on a road course for a stage win definitely a kid with balls. People need to leave it at the door and open their eyes it ain't about where you come from it's about who you are and what you do and can prove to the world.,0.2709,89
