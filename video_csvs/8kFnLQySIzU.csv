"+Johnny Irenchi in response to your comment: Yes, Josephus Flavius is the earliest non-Christian who mentions a Jesus. But he's not a contemporary source. Josephus' birth, well after the alleged crucifixion of Jesus, puts him out of range of an eyewitness account. Moreover, he wrote Antiquities in 93 C.E., after the first gospels got written and were circulating around! Therefore, his information could only serve as hearsay based on other non-contemporary accounts. That's no different than someone today mentioning Jesus in their writings simply because they read or heard the story from the gospels. Lastly, just as we have a brief mention of Jesus by Josephus in his Antiquities, Josephus also mentions Hercules (more times than Jesus), in the very SAME WORK! So should Josephus work be used to affirm the historicity of the character Hercules as a result? There are no artifacts, writings, eyewitnesses or contemporary sources about Hercules either.",0.2462,179

"Add this,  In  1994., Trump raped a 13 year old girl, in New York, who was trying to get into modeling.  She pressed charges but because he terrorized her and her family she and her parents,  dropped the charges.   He told her , he could make her and her family disappear.
HOW DOES A YOUNG GIRL PROVE THAT IN COURT.
 
Ask yourselves this,  if you were 13 , charging someone like Trump for raping you and knew Trump  had lots of connections and power, would you not have  dropped those charges. 
 If your family were in danger, you would have dropped it out of fear. Of course you would. 

Look up the New York times 1994, and see what I am talking about...and by the way no one talks about this anymore as if it never happened.

"Presuming someone is guilty before it's known to be true is also a sin in the Catholic catechism.

You waited saying these words till Roy Moore was actually condemned, did you?

Wait ... according to this wikipedian article he hasn't been so:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore_sexual_misconduct_allegations#Kelly_Harrison_Thorp 

Linking here to Thorp who believed Corfmann:

_""Kelly Harrison Thorp claimed Moore approached her asking for a date while she was working at a Red Lobster in 1982. She was 17 then and Moore was in his early 30s. Thorp asked if he knew how old she was, and she says that he stated: ""I go out with girls your age all the time."" Thorp denied his request. Thorp allegedly knows Corfman and stated she believed her story and was proud of her.""_

Note, in 1982 it would not in any way have been sinful for Roy Moore to try to date Kelly Thorp. She was past the pre-1917 canonic age. She was approaching the age in many states (if you marry sn on her 18th birthday, which legally you can, you probably knew her and dated her before 18).

The real problem is, in 1985, he married someone else's wife.

Why do I hear so much more of Catholics calling him out on some things he denied doing and using principles exaggerating guilt if done, and other things which would not even be guilty, if true, and ... no one calls him out for longstanding adultery? Is John Charles Heald dead?",-0.9748,281
