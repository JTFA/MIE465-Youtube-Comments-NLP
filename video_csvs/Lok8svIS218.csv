"Girl I'm 33 weeks pregnant with identical twins and I feel your pain. By ""pregnancy glow"" they mean ""oily and covered in acne"". I've learned that dairy makes it worse for me too, and I NEVER had a breakout or problem with acne except one huge pimple sometimes when I'd PMS, even as a teenager. Now at 24 I'm finally finishing puberty.",-0.7783,72
"Girl if you ever get pregnant so many things are going to happen to you that no one tells you about. Like I'm 33 weeks right now with identical boys, and no one told me that when you get past a certain size, it feels like your skin is getting ripped apart from the inside out as you stretch and grow, and that no amount of oils and butters help because your skin is just going to keep stretching and the skin on your stomach is numb so scratching doesn't even help (even though you shouldn't scratch). People also don't tell you how swollen you get down there because of all of the estrogen and it makes sex pretty much impossible (it feels like I'm losing my virginity EVERY TIME we have sex). I'm like wtf no one warned me about this but they will give me dumb advice I already know like don't eat raw sushi and stay away from nitrites.",-0.1779,173

Also a 5 year old Rotweiler/ yorkie mix (weird, i know) When we go hiking I want to try walking off leash but scared she'll just run off and leave me lol.. My question, is training necessary for off leash or would bringing treats to have her run back to me work just fine? I don't know if any of this made sense I'm just really jealous of how amazing Penny is off leash. I'm sure every dog will be different but wondering what you did with her!",0.8623,142
