"A couple years ago i discovered that the best way to get the most flavor and sensation out of chocolate is to let it melt in your tongue as aposed to munching on it like an animal. Chocolate is one of the few foods that will change from a solid to a liquid from temperature of your mouth. Not only is this a more delicious way of eating chocolate, it also reduces the rate that you will be eating it by. Typically takes me a week and a half to get through a 70% darl chocolate bar when i let it melt on my tongue.",0.9061,111

In nature, big doses of sweet tasting fat was rare and our brain rewards us for indulging in it. As long as we keep the doses in check and exercise, that pleasure isn't all bad.",0.872,102
