America has always been fond of raising cattle on open lands and raising the best quality and tasting beef for a pure, meat experience. While it's true that France and much of Europe and Latin America has taught America much about basic and advanced cooking, searing a well marbled steak and finishing in a hot oven or other methods really showcase the quality of the beef. New York also has been a steakhouse city given the meat packing district and business culture that is tied in with steakhouses.

Wagyu is sooooooooo good. But it's better in Japan imo. And unless someone shows me the paperwork I would assume all Wagyu in the United States is fake. I've read before that only 8 establishments in the entire nation actually get and serve the real stuff. Literally everyone else is fake Kobe/Wagyu.,0.34,59

"Well firstly what‚Äôs called wagyu whatnot literally means ‚Äújapanese cow‚Äù. I live in Asia so it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly‚Äù 7 hours flight to tokyo.

And like I said I haven‚Äôt tried kobe beef before. But I had a slice of miyazaki which ppl consider better if not the same as kobe, but I‚Äôm not entitled to give opinion as I was having a slice. But I can say miyazaki was way more beefy than wagyu A5+ that ppl call to be tasting more like kobe.

I suggest go directly to japan, cos they don‚Äôt have to freeze the meat. Cos once I thought wagyu a5+ is already great in my country, then it‚Äôs whole another level when it‚Äôs fresh",0.9346,146
