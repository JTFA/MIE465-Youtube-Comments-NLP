"My next vote will be based on two things :  gun control and taxes.  This new tax law primarily benefits the wealthy.  Looking at Berkshire Hathaway record earnings and seeing the headlines that Buffett is sitting on $110 billion in cash and can't figure out what to do with it, tells me they got it wrong.  As a divorced dad paying non-tax-deductible child support, all they did was double my deductions and eliminate my exemption, which is a net zero.  I lose almost 25% of my income to payroll tax, and state and federal taxes.  Then I lose another 6% to child support.   The new tax law will immediately inflate corporate earnings by 10 percent which means stocks will go up even more.  Who benefits? Well, certainly not the 60 percent of the population that does not own stocks in any form.  Businesses won't hire people they don't need just because their taxes went down.  CEO's and wealthy stock-holders will be the main beneficiaries.   My second issue is gun control.  Republicans are doing nothing.  We need to keep lunatics from getting them.

But like the chess playing pidgeon, they do not seem to be smart enough to actually get what is going on. They would do well to read some actual books on economics so they will know when they are being taken for a ride.

Lets just look at one of the issues being made fun of here, The Laffer Curve. It is constantly made fun of by the liberal left because they can't refute it, so they marginalize it, call it by alternate names like ""voodoo economics"" etc.. But the truth is in what actually happens when you apply these principals. For Example, look at Miami FL before and after the Drug Lords. When the Drug Lords started making it big there, cash was raining every where. It went into the pockets of the Drug Lords and then rained down on the rest of the community. 

Miami went from a sleepy retirement community to a powerhouse of wealth. Property prices skyrocketed. The city skyline changed. Gentrification happened along the beaches. Suddenly you had high end jewelry shops selling Rolex Watches and high end auto dealers selling million dollar cars. Suddenly everyone who wanted a job could find very lucrative employment providing services to the Drug Lords and then later the rich that were drawn to the new affluent communities. This is what happens when you inject cash into a community, much like what happens when you let people keep more of what they earned. Study the Laffer Curve.

Now I have had this conversation with many left wingers and that is why I generalize then as dumb, ignorant, or just plain prevaricators. They will never have an honest conversation about this, they will either get snotty and prevaricate the issues or they get bombastic or facetious. But they will never have a straight up honest discussion.",0.9608,370

"This video is so misleading. Everyone gets a tax cut and of course if you pay more taxes you'll see a greater tax cut. The tax cut for people ends in 10 years, but can be extended at any time. The ""Corporate"" tax cut is permmanent. This means all existing and new business will pay less taxes. The people who employee other people pay less taxes. Why is that bad? It will lead to more investment in the country and with the penalty for bring money back into the USA also cut, more and more corporations will be bringing money back into the United States. Lower unemployement means lower rates of people on entitlement programs. SOMEONE is always going to be the rich guy or the rich company. If you take, take and take from the people who employee others they will stop trying and no one will have jobs. Don't forget. The extra money that is being thrust into the economy is actually going right to the states. Example: If a state has a 6% tax, $1000 extra dollars only has to be spent 16- 17 times within a year to gain all the money back in taxes. The bad thing is that all that extra money in tax revenue will go to a bunch of corrupt politicians who will no doubt mismange those funds.",-0.9612,251

"You underestimated the Trump admin. That gap will certainly be closed by cutting off social programs for illegals and bringing in big companies' overseas profits. Apple alone has declared to bring back 300 BILLION in cash, which Trump mentioned in his state of the union speech. And that's just a start. He'll also use other tactics to sell weapons to the US allies, or maybe devaluating the US dollar so big companies are encouraged to bring back jobs and money as they can now exchange the same amount of foreign currencies into more US dollars.",0.0772,103
