"Again, thank you to the NSC. 
Tragically this wall will continue to expand until patients - and more importantly - opioid prescribers understand that a responsible, proven acute pain treatment option is available - and their peers have been using it for years.

Please become a beacon of awareness (and hope) by sharing what's working for acute pain treatment in Emergency Rooms, surgical centers, and private practices across America. Please, if you or anyone you know is going to be prescribed an opioid, visit https://www.painpack.co and click on the tab ""Click Here for Printable Version"" https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/a216ff_0ad439bc324f470b9950e8c6ec4bb1e5.pdf
There is no simple solution to this crisis, but individual action now may be the best way to proactively prevent this wall from expanding.",0.7224,147
