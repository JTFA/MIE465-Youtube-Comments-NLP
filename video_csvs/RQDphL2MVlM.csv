"Beautiful outfits but sister...this is not correct hijab. Hijab is not for display or fashion, its not to cause attention in anyway, is supposed to hide your feminine charms even if its loose ! Your hair must to not show. You can delete the comment but you will never delete the truth. Allah guide me and rest we all have something to correct.I have arab muslim friends and they love fashion they cover modestly without Hijab and they would be scared to start hijab and not do it correctly thats why they take time to make this decision. When you are ready for Hijab we must be ready to give up make up outside,ready to not need any attention from this world, ready to give up fashion and keep as simple as possible in colour range and all. Its not just about covering a part of your hair. And ready from inside our heart to know we do this for Allah. Look at the christian nuns they do it the best. I dont know what happened to muslims.",0.98,196
