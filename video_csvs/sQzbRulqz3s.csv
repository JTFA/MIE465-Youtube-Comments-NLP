"Leed los evangelios San Mateo a San Juan 10-15 minutos diarios 
 Así regresaréis a los brazos de Jesus.
Rezad el Rosario diariamente también, empezad todos los días
Con 3 ave Maria's hasta llegar a completarlo en un día.
Rezad a San Jose 7 padre nuestros, 7 ave Marías y 7 Gloria's 
Diariamente porque alcanza mucho De Dios. El papa Juan Pablo ll dijo la santidad es una gracia
Pedidla todos los días 
Ver testimonio de sor Faustina sobre la existencia del Infierno en Google.
Necio es el que pudiendo conocerMe no lo hace
Pero más necio aún es el que Me conoce Me abandona. Jesús 


 Follow Jesus thru the gospels. Read Saint Mathew thru Saint John
10-15 min daily and pray the rosary daily as well. You'll quickly return
To Jesus's arms. Start with 3 Hail Marys if the whole rosary is too long.
Pray to saint Joseph 7 Our Father's, 7 Hail Marys and 7 Glory be's daily, he is a powerful intercessor and sheds many graces from God.
Ask for the grace of holiness as Saint John Paul ll said it must be asked
For daily.
