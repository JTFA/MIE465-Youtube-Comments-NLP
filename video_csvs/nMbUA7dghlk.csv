You have many spelling and grammar mistakes in all your videos. Second and mainly you have no respect for the equipment. If you understood 1/100 of what goes into making these things you wouldn't be throwing them around and abusing them the way you do. That is so childish and arrogant to act like you don't care about the technology that has made you famous. It is unbelievably high tech engineering that deserves better attention than what you give it. And thirdly, grow up a little. You do realize that the majority of your fan base is probably less than 17 years old. You're funny but to a certain point. Try to improve in these ways and you'll continue to grow as you have.

"I love the idea of not having to be sure to point the camera exactly where I need it. I record jet ski rides and most times it ends up just looking forward like a dash cam. With Rylo I could easily get a shot of my wife on her jet ski, or get a shot of me riding without using two Go Pros. I also think this camera will be huge with mountain bikers, but like you said not the ""Pro"" guys since most of them use gimbals and the Rylo's video quality isnt quite at the level of GoPro. But, for a casual video maker I would LOVE stable video without having to wear some crazy gimbal rig that I could fall on and destroy in an instant.

"I think 360 cameras are the future in case of editing. Say you shoot a video in the city (like you do), you dont have to turn over and focus on something happening outside of your view. You could find it in post production. However, publishing 360 videos so the viewer can turn any direction, i dunno. To me the viewer may lose focus on whats important and look at the filmer the entire time or one particular subject. So, 360 for viewers: no. 360 for editors: yes.",-0.4215,103

I think That was bit too harsh line by u for startup that produced go pro quality at 500,-0.4404,19

They could have made a killing on selling batteries. I just bought a Rylo, and I can't wait to try it out. I literally just bought an Insta360 Nano a few days ago as well, and I love it, which is why I wanted to try the Rylo for it's awesome stabilization. I wonder if I should get the waterproof case.

I don't have experience with drones and filming, but I see a lot of benefits of not having to orient your drone and camera with respect to the object you would like to film; Instead it seems like you could just fly it somewhere close to the object you are interested in and care about the camera angles during the post processing. Of course under the assumption that the landing gear is not in the field of view. Sound wouldn't be a problem either, plus their might be weight savings in case a gimbal would become not necessary anymore.",0.9798,116

"Sorry Casey, I do not agree with your last statement about who this is for. I could see this camera being used by many users. I may have to buy one to play around with it.

You can still use these devices for professional use, like marketing or brand awareness, its not about the most stunning capture its about the experience that it creates. We use Samsung 360 for a lot of added bonus features in our business and truthfully they out perform the traditional camera shots when it comes to brand awareness. We shoot with Canon gear but the Samsung 360 has opened a lot of doors for creative content that users take notice on. General users are not that concerned about if it looks professional anymore, just look at Instagram and the images that are popular today. 30 years ago if someone posted what is popular today everyone would have thought they were a clown with a camera, the times have changed. 

This Rylo camera would be great for on the go shots and I would love to see them make it so you could pair a Bluetooth mic with it for better audio, that would make this item the perfect fit for a good range of users.",0.9934,225
