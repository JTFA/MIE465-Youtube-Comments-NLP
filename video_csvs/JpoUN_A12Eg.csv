"""I feel like no one complaining about the broom boy scene has ever seen a movie before.""

Well, that's kind of true. The over-saturation of Disney/Marvel movies has trained audience's brains to expect everything to be a set up for something else (like another film). The idea that an image can be there simply to evoke an idea or express a feeling or a theme is lost on modern audiences. Because I wouldn't call what Disney/Marvel does as being real film-making. People are just used to Marvel Studios' nonsense now. The fact that The Last Jedi felt like a real movie was a surprise and the main reason why I liked it.",0.8319,129

"+Marley James, I don't have a dog in either of those fights. I didn't care much for TFA and I'm not fond of fan theories. JJ's mystery box is what got fans talking in the first place. It's stupid and shows a man who doesn't know what he wants from a story, only that he wants people talking. Regardless, there are seeds planted. There's some set-up for Rey. The silly bit with Anakin's lightsaber calling to her is a good example. It implies there's something more to her, something we don't yet rightly know. Doesn't mean JJ knows where it's going, but it is there. This gets no payoff, the best we get is that she's a nobody. That's not really a payoff to the mystery, it's just a middle finger to fans that maybe wanted some answers. Snoke and Kylo have some set-up, there's little info we're given about how Snoke turned Kylo or why, yet that also goes without payoff. Snoke just dies and that's that. I dunno. Even as someone who wasn't invested in the sequel trilogy or the mystery box, these write offs of potential development seem pretty hackneyed, like Rian subverted expectations just to subvert them.",0.8426,228
"- Snoke was built up as a major character, some form of powerful dark side user who even Palpatine was potentially looking for. Disney have gone to loads of effort to build him up, his early and easy death seems like such a wasted character and such a let down, especially without any backstory he just seems like a plot device. As for the Emperor from the original trilogy, he seemed to play a much more darker role and his origins were fleshed out in the prequels and additional lore.

- Kylo Ren is not a scary villain, nor is the First Order and General Hux is a joke. Almost everyone seems to have forgotten their military training or leadership abilities or tactics/military doctrine seem to have gone out of the window since the end of the Galactic Civil War. Grand Moth Tarkin and Admiral Thrawn are good examples of methodical, disciplined and commanding leaders. Kylo Ren seems too much of a tantrum emo/scene kid for me to be able to consider him a threatening antagonist, especially when coupled with the First Order in general they seem like a non-threat given how much hardware and man-power they have lost in two movies for an organisation that does not hold nearly half as much resources the Empire did. Hux is a terrible commander, they don't follow any form of military common sense and in two movies they have lost a planet sized death star, a dreadnaught, many resurgent class battlecruisers and that mega class capital ship.... seriously what else have they got left to bring to the table at this point? ...

- Status Quo, I don't understand this one either really, all we know if that the ""resistance"" as it has been known has survived with seemingly less than 100 people and no ships besides the Millennium Falcon, but unless the First Order pull god knows what out of no where in the next movie I don't see what they have left to bring to the fight in the next film besides what ever star destroyers they have left.... However, what we do know is that this is supposed to be the birth of the second rebellion... this doesn't make sense within the already existing lore... The First Order was a group built up in the unknown regions, financed by weapon manufacturers and pro-imperialists, but they were not a serious territory holding power/faction worthy of note by the New Republic (which is why Leia formed the resistance private military group). During Star Killer's attack on the New Republic capital worlds only one of many Republic fleets was destroyed... so according to Disney canon, there are still Republic fleets out there, and the First Order have lost so much hardware and man-power fighting a small band of resistance fighters I'm not sure what this new ""rebellion"" is against. It is not stated anywhere that all remaining New Republic forces surrendered immediately to the First Order and all former Imperial and now New Republic territories have been ceded to the First Order without any form of resistance besides ""The Resistance"".... So from a story/plot side, this is not quite adding up.

- Rey, as far as a character backstory goes, she has none... it has been teased and talked about, hyped up more by the first film, actors and games... and the reveal is somewhat disappointing. Fair enough if she has nobodies for parents, but after all the hype, that was a disappointment for many. My problem with Rey is that she IS a Mary Sue. Almost everything she does is to help someone else, almost everything she does is better than pretty much everyone else, she does not really need help except for on two occasions, she has made no serious mistakes and ones she has made turned out to be a form of chaotic luck and worked out well in the end. She was able to hold her own against a (granted an injured) Kylo Ren in TFA using a lightsaber (FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER), she is also way too adept at using the force for a rookie. They have tried to change canon to explain her over-poweredness, even Anakin who is supposed to be a force being created through the force a lone took years to use such abilities. Yes you can use the force, but its more of a enhanced awareness, enhanced reactions and accidental powers. It takes time to learn to tame, to control which is why Jedi preferred to start training from young ages. Rey receives three lessons, if that, from Luke during TLJ and has somehow immediately fights and acts like a fully trained Jedi.

- Regarding Poe and the first fight in the film. Yes he disobeyed orders, yes lives were lost, but they took out a Dreadnaught which according to canon sources had roughly 200,000 crew on-board... on a military front this is a good trade and the risks were worth it. As for Admiral Holdo, considering that her and Poe are now seemingly the two most high ranking officers left, she shows no ability to even pull him to one side and explain the stakes, even if not giving away  her full intentions. Her treatment of him was not a display of good leadership forcing Poe to take action to try and save everyone, which obviously didn't work in the end.

- Rose... her decision to save Finn was selfish and her reason was completely idiotic given that by doing so directly puts the lives of everyone else they know at immediate risk.

- Luke, I hate how they have treated his character. This is the guy who against everyone's opinion and against all of the odds believed that there was good in his father, Darth Vader, so when he sense even a small amount of the dark side in Ben he nearly does a very, very  bad thing... given that Ben is Han and Leia's kid... and then despite his friend's lives being at risk, including his sister's and Han's death he refuses to help.... this is not what Luke stands for and I strongly believe that he should have survived until at least episode IX. Even Mark Hamil disagrees with how his character has been portrayed.

- Captain Phasma... better performance than in TFA, but still feels like a waste and seriously must now be dead.


To me Star Wars The Last Jedi was an enjoyable movie, visually. Great visuals, epic fight scenes..... but that's about it. To me the story is a problem as it contradicts a lot of what we already know, there are plot holes and Rey is still a Mary Sue.

JJ, Rian Jonson and Kathleen Kennedy say that disliking this movie makes us sexist. This is fundamentally false. None of us have a problem with the main character being female, none of us have a problem with Vice Admiral Holdo being female etc.. it's the way they are written, it's how good character development has been replaced by political agenda driven characters.

For example, Luke made mistakes, he struggled to learn the force and then when he did have his first lightsaber battle vs Vader, he lost, loosing both his hand and his weapon (which eventually turns up in TFA). He has to learn, adapt and overcome.",-0.991,1356
"... That isn't what people want in a villain.  Like at all.  Kylo Ren isn't a good villain because he isn't really very threatening to the protagonist, Rey.  Good villains are, in their relevant context, better than the protagonist in their competition.  The story comes through the protagonists trials/journey to overcome something they originally cannot.  The problem however, is that Rey had her whole hero arc in the 1st movie (very poor writing), and is now stronger than her main antagonist (Kylo).",-0.3119,99
"1 Snoke was lame, and killing him off was more interesting to you.
If he was lame, why did they put him in the movie at all?  You aren't setting your franchise up for success when your directors are ""fixing"" all the ""lame"" stuff that the previous director established.

Also, the Red Wedding comparison fails.  Game of Thrones his a huge universe with multiple characters and plot points, each one connected with the others however delicately, where one event happening to one of them has major ramifications for the rest of them.  Rob Stark's death effectively ended one plot point while launching several others.  Snoke's death was just thrown in because, OH WHATA TWIST!

You know what would have been a better twist?  If Kylo killed Rey.  I mean, she's portrayed as some invincible Mary Sue, so killing her would play with the expectations of the audience, right?  No, you don't have the same luxury that Game of Thrones has, because Game of Thrones has over ten times the number of important characters that Starwars does, and can afford to bump a few off to keep the story moving.  YOU DON'T KILL OFF YOUR MAIN BAD GUY IN ACT 2 JUST TO PROMOTE HIS SIDEKICK.",-0.9718,233
"10. Snoke isn't anybody. This is apparently a good thing. She's more excited that a villain who can't intimidate a fly is there rather than Snoke. Oookay? Why we liked them is since he was the only even remotely threatening thing in the Order. Now... they're a joke. Yay! Subversion! We all want potentless enemies, right?
OH GOD... The Emperor argument again. Yeah, cause it was totally not the second movie there with a well-established opposition (The Empire) compare to The First Order who just came out of nowhere 3 movies later when 2 movies ago we totally beat the Empire and brought peace to the galaxy. But totally the same thing, don't explain why we suddenly have a new Empire after our heroes won. That's good storytelling right? How can people not see this difference?
9. Kylo sucks as villain. Pretty much the exact same argument as 10, but let's roll with it. As apprentice he works fine. As main baddy, you need someone who can realistically be intimidating or lead an army. Kylo fails at both. He's a joke villain. That's the problem. Good for a secondary villain, not the primary. She poses what movies have scary villains. Why? Classics. Terminator (2), Alien(s), The Matrix, Star Wars, LOTR. Odd, ain't that? Moving on... Oh wait, we got HUX. Who's now a clown. TFA Hux, maybe. TLJ Hux, joke. And the knights of Ren! Did YOU see them this movie? Good job making your argument revolving things Rian just couldn't bother adding.
8. No story left, pointless since it's like ""a day after TFA where nothing happens"". Actually, both are entirely true. TFA left tons of threads for the story, all killed now. The ending left little interest or motivation for IX. It could be anything. Not exactly great for the end of a trilogy. Oh and apparently Rey beating a 15-year trained Jedi first battle was a good thing now. Uhuh. Kylo having no motivations is good. The enemy all crying is good. WHAT AM I HEARING?
7. Rey is nobody. Mary Sue confirmed. That's good now too. Wouldn't want actual backstories or logical reasons for power in this trilogy now would we. All we want is a reason for her to NOT train like LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE. Or train. Note we got neither.
6. Luke the Mass-murderer; Apparently the only reason he tried it on Vader was since he couldn't defeat him in combat. He could Kylo so, OFF WITH HIS HEAD. *mind blows* What am I hearing. What IV, V and VI did you see that makes you think Luke is a sociopath? ""Yeah, actually fighting wouldn't be what the good guy does. Killing in his sleep, yeah, that's good guy stuff"" (paraphrasing but she literally said that).
5. Leia in space. Visually it looked bad, yes. Story-wise as well. Once again, you don't suddenly gain Force Powers. You train. Rey doesn't, that was a major complaint in TFA. Why would anyone think it would go over better in much higher quantities in TLJ? TRAINING. You need to Train to be a Jedi. Anakin, Luke and Kylo all trained for YEARS. Rey and Leia not a day. You see why that's an issue?
4. Everything is Holdo's fault. Yeah, it is. Why didn't she told the plan. Being a terrible leader. Wouldn't be AS bad if the movie also acknowledged her being a terrible leader. Yet, it does all in it's power to portray her right while she's not. There's the fault people put at it. Also ""guy she just met""... with the Resistance being apparently like 100 people and she being a general... how is that possible? It's not. Only with bad storytelling. Also no, people didn't die when Poe ""found out the plan"" since he didn't. People died since he DIDN'T know the plan. Once he knew the plan he was like ""that's a good plan"", and that was it.
3. Ryan sets up his trilogy with broom boy. Sorry you missed the memo, but yeah... he totally did. Welcome to now knowing.
2. The B-plot was pointless since it didn't work. You forgot boring, preachy, had horrible characters, and contributed nothing to the end-result. Notice how Cloud City failed but nobody has an issue with that. Since it did ""failure"" right. Not just failure for the sake of failure. And you say ""they learn from this failure"". Since they don't, you kinda contradict your own reasoning for it having a reason to exist. If it paid off, it wouldn't be pointless now would it. And there would be less complains. But it's not, hence concerns. Also 3/4th the failures list every movies have. Since you added ""the bad guys plan got thwarted = failure"" in there. Such a never seen before concept. Not to mention you literally bring up your 4th point here. You can't complain about this whole thing screwing up Holdo yet ignore the whole thing didn't happen if Holdo just said the darn plan.
1. ""The film challenges you""... WHAT? What does that even MEAN? Oh, it means ""subversions"". Yeah, those were bad. A subversion can work (KOTOR), but adding 20 kinda delutes their purpose. Subverting a subvertion (Leia dies! Oh she doesn't!) even more so. All the end result leads to is you just get completely uninterested in the content since literally everything gets retconned, sometimes even minutes later anyway. Where's the tension then? If you can't add in decent tension, don't expect me to keep attention. Which they probably hoped for anyway with the many plotholes added in there you're supposed to not register.

But I'm glad our major story issues are just no problem at all and the real issue is snakes.",-0.9972,1167
"1: Superman Leia - Its obviously stupid, if she died in that scene it could've set up a lot more with Kylo, but instead they decide to bring her back (sorta) for some reason.

2: The whole plot is based around the galaxy's slowest chase scene - The first order didn't just get a few ships to jump ahead? Didn't call for backup? Didn't just let their fighters destroy the resistance? mkay..

3: The pointless Rose/Fin subplot - goes nowhere, adds nothing, is basically just filler.

4: Rose - pointless character with a line more cringy than ""I hate sand""... ""Save the ones you love, not fight the ones you hate""... Which is contradictory to pretty much the entire movie and is hilarious as the resistance last defense is being blown to shit behind them.

5: Fin's redemption arc ending with Rose crashing into him - not only was Rose nowhere near him when she appeared out of nowhere, she also crashes into him, almost dies and stops him from sacrificing himself to stop the first order, which would've completed his arc.

6: Admiral purple hair (I dunno her name) - Boring character thrown in for pretty much no reason. She's completely unlikable and really only exists for artificial conflict because she wont tell her fleet commander her plan... which she should tell him, he destroyed SK base, he's their commander, she should tell him... but she doesn't? Why? It doesn't make any sense.

7: I guess this counts as Rose/Fin subplot, but the casino planet - Just awful, basically prequel level of bad.
- Additionally they ""save"" the animals by letting them free... which means nothing as they'll just be recaptured and put back into captivity.
- Don't save the slaves, you think they would as the slaves are now going to be forced to clean up after their rampage.
- This whole segment of the film only exists for ""deep messages"" that are either contradicted or just don't make sense.

8: Rey is still boring and unlikable - I guess this is entirely subjective. But nothing about her is likable. She just exists and goes through events. Does she have goals? A direction? Not really, hell Luke asks if she does and she has no response, she just exists as a blank slate to project yourself on.

9: I didn't want to talk about expectations, because thats one of the big ""HA, YOU JUST EXPECTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO :P"" rebuttals that is as stupid as it sounds. But I will anyways - Luke is a completely different character in this movie, he's not even Luke anymore. You're telling me that Luke, the guy who tried to save his father, who was basically HITLER, from the dark side, tried to kill his nephew, because he saw a little bit of darkness in him? Thats just pathetic writing. His character in TLJ is just insultingly bad. 
- To add to this, since when did Rey learn to speak Wookie? And why did she translate Chewbaka for Luke? I guess its a nitpick, but its still so bad..

10: THE TWISTS AND PLOTS GOING NOWHERE! - honestly, I keep seeing people say ""you're just mad about Rian subverting your expectations!""... Like ok, I will admit I was annoyed about some of the decisions, sure, who isn't? But the thing is... even the things I didn't expect made no sense and went nowhere.
- Snokes death meant nothing, his character meant nothing, he existed, was powerful as hell, came out of nowhere and just died pathetically. Why? At least the Emperor served the purpose of being a generic evil villain that existed to be evil. Snoke felt like he meant something, had a story, had some purpose, but still died. It just feels like lazy writing. Easiest way to get out of writing a character is to just kill them off amirite?
- Rey's parents being no one of importance. This could've been interesting.... but it wasn't. Just another... why? Ok, so now she has no reason for being so powerful and being able to do basically anything other than ""well she has lots of light force energy"". Ok... so she's just a mary sue now? Thats basically what she is. She has no goals or motivation, she can do anything without needing help, she outdoes other characters who logically would have far more experience than her, she is liked by basically everyone including the villains. She's a mary sue, any excuse someone brings up basically confirms it, people desperately try to find excuses for it, you shouldn't need to, it should be at least a little obvious, but in this its like ""yeah nah, she's just good at stuff"".
- Fins arc (already explained above)
- Rose existing to... well... exist?
- Kylo/Ben, pretty much went nowhere, he's still just an angry kid, now he's an angry kid leading the first order. I had expected them to do something with him, maybe do more with his conflict, make him a grey jedi, make him turn good, make him turn bad but something else happens, but nah, he just becomes generic villain by the end. Maybe I just really liked his character before TLJ? I dunno.

11: If you wanted to you could watch Mauler's critique on TLJ, its pretty good, really long but covers every reason why its a bad movie.

12: Smaller logical inconsistencies. Before you say anything, yeah, SW is a movie about space wizards. Guess what? They're also spending millions on making the movie so you'd expect simple stuff to not be a problem, you'd also expect them to at least try and make stuff make at least a little sense.
- ""Bomber ships"", I love WW2 stuff, but comon, these ships make no logical sense whatsoever. Firstly, they're slow as hell, but they're also weak as hell, being destroyed with very few shots, what point is there to a ship slow and weak? Secondly, the hanger has no visible force field, you could go out of your way to argue that you just cant see it, I'd argue laziness. Also the bombs dropping makes no sense as the planets gravity isn't below the ship, there is no indication of magnetization or that they're launched. 
Bit of a nit pick, but just something you'd expect to be in there, especially as they seem to go out of their way to give the ships the WW2 bomber feel.
- Ship fuel. Don't think this has been a thing in SW until now... pretty bad decision imo.
- Hyperspace tracker. So Fin says he's never heard of it, Rose says its impossible, next scene Fins says he used to clean the room its in and Rose acts like she knows how they could shut it down with the help of a hacker? Mkay.
- Rey somehow mastering using a lightsaber. Dunno when she learned to use a lightsaber, Luke took like 7 years to get somwewhat good, Rey just is... because... well.. because. (No, you cant just get good with a lightsaber because you use a staff. Any idiot should be able to understand that logic).
- The dreadnaught not being able to take care of a single fighter. Ok, so, you can say Poe is a great pilot. Ok sure. But they dont really say that in the movie, they instead make the excuse the guns on the ship aren't meant for close range fighters... why? You'd think they'd have guns for close range fighters, that'd make sense... right? Mkay.
- Leia stepping through a door that leads out into the vacuum of space. They could've done something for that, but nah.

13: The force in this movie make no sense.
Ok sure, space wizards.
Ok sure, 30 years have passed.

- In the OT, the force was pretty straightforward. You can move things, sense things and shoot out lightening. Mkay, lighting is a dark side thing, sure, makes enough sense.
- In TLJ (not including TFA), you can now force skype calls and be physically affected by something, not even have to be in the same ship as a guy to throw them around like a doll and god knows what else they're planning on doing in the next film. 
Bit of a logic jump with too many questions that are unanswered (because they kill off snoke instead of keeping him to at least explain some of this stuff).

Because I know someone will argue about force lightening, allow me to explain:
Lightening makes sense as its something to be expected from an evil-doer. Generally speaking, you expect someone who is evil to use good powers in evil ways. An example of this is lightening, raising the dead or well, any good power that you could find an evil use with (raising the dead is basically healing put to an extreme for an evil purpose). 
With Snoke's powers, Luke as well I guess. It just kinda comes out of nowhere, with Luke it literally comes out of nowhere as he was ""cut off from the force"", but just turns it back on again and can use something so powerful?  Riiight. Feels like a plot device really.

14: To be honest, the force at this point really is just a plot device.
- In the OT and prequels the force was something mystical, it could be used like a tool, but wasn't treated as one, it was somewhat of a lesson that the jedi (luke specifically) learned from and had a greater meaning. If you look into it, the force is the human spirit. In the OT and even the prequels, there was a subtle message of machines taking over the human spirit. The force was a counter to this, hell Luke puts away a machine to use the force instead to blow up the death star.
Now its really just ""How to get a character out of a sticky situation? I dunno, force powers"".

15: This is more of an annoyance if anything.
The complete disregard of actual legitimate criticisms.

Just like this vid, people seem to push aside legitimate criticisms because ""muh haturz"" and other stupid reasons.
If more than 50% of the people who see the movie say its not very good, then maybe its not very good?
People seem to be brushing it off as a minority of haters... How?
People have done hour long videos explaining why they disliked TLJ but its still just ""random haters and trolls"".
Yeah sure.
I'm not going to say ""Muh disney shills!"" or something stupid.
But I am going to say that defenders seem to have some weird bias.
I'm not even a big star wars fan, I just like cinema and film making. I like the originals and prequels (I find them bad but not hate-able).
I dislike TLJ because its just plain bad. Thats all it is, bad.

"1:14 Oh god I hope you're not going to be one of those people who claims the movie is brilliant just because it subverts expectations. Subversions of expectations just for the sake of it don't work when the choices are absolutely awful and a lot of choices don't fit the characters or the lore.

1:25 Because it requires explanation to make sense in the larger context of the saga... You can't use the emperor in the original trilogy as an example because the context of the characters is completely different. In the OT it was still a fresh universe that wasn't expanded beyond the movies. Episode VIII takes place in a large established universe with established lore. For thousands of years there would only be two sith at a time. A master and an apprentice. Snoke was very likely alive during the OT. Where did he come from? How did he learn his power? Where was he during the OT? How come Palpatine never knew about him? How did he get to seducing Kylo? How did he take over the remnants of the empire? These are questions that need to be answered for his character to make sense in the franchise!

Also, the way he goes out makes no sense. He can mentally link Rey and Kylo without them being aware he's pulling the strings. Yet he can't sense a freaking lightsaber moving right next to his body? 

2:09 Yes, it would explain his FREAKING EXISTENCE!

4:39 Yeah Hux, who's been turned into a complete idiot. Such a compelling villain.

7:14 Here's the issue with that : 1) TFA made it out to be this big plot point that would be revealed later. Then TLJ just drops that plot point, just like it does with a lot of others. The director literally said it was the ""most shocking"" idea he could think of. And that just demonstrates the problem : It wants to be different for the sake of being different, shocking the audience comes first, the story comes second.

2) It would also be able to provide a proper explanation as to why Rey is just so goddamn powerful. She wins against the Praetorian guard while Kylo loses despite having zero training. She has insane force powers without any training. Then it turns out this random daughter of junkers has more potential than the most powerful Sith Lord ever, the person who was created by Darth Plagueis to be an excellent force wielder, one of the most powerful Jedi Masters ever, etc. Makes no sense in the lore.

8:01 Yes, that's a completely fair argument. Your mental gymnastics do nothing for me. It would at the most be a passing thought, Luke would never actually consider it and get really close. Your argument about him trying to kill Vader also does nothing for me, as that was his moment of being pulled to the Dark Side. It added to his character and he overcame that dark side to become a full on Jedi.

11:40 Yes, also fair. It's not all her fault, but a part of the blame is clearly on her as she should have been able to anticipate his actions. She knew he was a hothead, that he does not listen. Then she actively creates a scenario where without the proper context, it easily comes across as if she's betraying them. He did what the information he had seemed like the best chance at survival.
It is later revealed that Poe actually likes her plan ""yeah that might actually work"" or something in those lines, it's not a verbatim quote. So yes, if she had revealed to Poe what the plan was, he would not have committed mutiny. We're also not talking about the whole crew, just the one person who's most likely to screw things up...

13:48 The B-pot was pointless. Sure it drove the point about failure even further, but there were so many ways to do that. Instead we got plot convenience, shoehorned in-your-face morals and some of the easiest ""lessons"" (animal abuse is bad, slavery is bad, capitalism is bad, there is good and evil on both sides) and potential for a character arc that did not deliver. It just dragged on for way too long.

19:07 So you're not bothered by all the ways it breaks the universe, makes basically everything that happend in the OT pointless, and is filled to the brim with plot holes? How the whole setup of the movie, you know the chase, made absolutely zero sense? The writing in this movie is awful.",-0.9155,857

"Alright I'm going to try and address and explain based on some of these points, just in an effort to foster empathy and understanding between both sides:
1. Star Wars has never been Game of Thrones. A mildly-depressing, edgy, uncomfortable tone works great for Walking Dead, Breaking Bad and as you mentioned, Game of Thrones. This is Star Wars. Emphasis on fun, action, and a core with a strong spiritual/hopeful nature.
2. Snoke not being anything, is zero payoff. We can SEE, he's a big badass character. We're not guessing, like Steven Seagal in Air Force One. He's obviously badass. The Emperor also is a prime example. Payoff. He has MINIMAL LINES, so he could have been killed off, and he never did anything. Snoke was given SOOO much! And then, bah, nope, something to struggle and overcome? Nah. This film is worthless, you don't get that foundation.
What Snoke is, he's the hot person you want to talk to at a party but they leave before you can. I mean....we don't LIKE bad guys. We liked Robb Stark. Taking away our problems so easily feels just SOO cheap. Where's the payoff and struggle? It makes the entire experience feel so worthless. Meaningless films don't last long in the memory.
Also, I don't care if he's Plageuis. But it WOULD have told us something about him! It would mean he trained Palpatine, from that lore-building scene in the prequels. We'd have known SOMETHING, and something is better than nothing.
3. Alright you think Kylo Ren is hot. That's okay. But you want to reform....the guy who killed his dad in cold blood...??? Um....alright I don't want to say anything personal. But because that's a strange thought process from you personally, I at least hope you look at it. Geez I could kinda understand Walter White, but he DEFINITELY couldn't be reformed, and he never killed family or friends.
4. Luke's arc....he just needed more explanation. We didn't see his decline. We'd have been fine with him falling to the dark side. He was pathetic and underdeveloped. They introduced a new character and refused to develop him.
5. Carrie Poppins just looked stupid. That was all. No big deal, should have been less stupid looking.
6. Poe's demotion makes no sense. Those ships were always far too slow to do anything. He managed to do the impossible with severely under-strength equipment. That's worthy of the medal of honour. As for ""sensitive information"", if you don't TRUST, your brothers-in-arms, then you are FINISHED! She had no reason to withhold that information, she came across as an unstable person (most fans seemed to think she was a traitor), and in a court marshal situation, she'd be crucified for failing to delegate and unify her team. She's at fault, purely from a tactical command perspective, she acted like a dictator and suffered the consequences as the resistance is pretty much all dead. Burden of leadership and she was in command.
7. Snakes kill people and are sneaky. Pretty reasonable people would hate them. They call Anakin an Earthling in Phantom Menace, he's not from Earth.
Look bottom line we're definitely very far apart. I don't care why you liked it, your business. But I just think the reasons we DISLIKED it, shouldn't be picked apart as though we're wrong. You're right for your reasons for liking it. We're right for our reasons for disliking it. And we'll see how many of us are in the left watching in the same movie theatre for the next iteration. I hope it's a lot, but I have serious doubts. If you REALLY love Star Wars, you'll agree that listening to and attending to our complaints will keep the fan base stronger and legitimise the budget for future movies. Because if it can't be for all of us, there may well not be enough fans to make it for just you",-0.9955,775

To me it was just a well-executed genre film that took some risks and wasn't afraid to BE a genre film (aside some unfortunate overuse of bathos, a habit it must have picked up from being too close to Marvel Studios). Regardless of how great it was, it was just nice to see a movie that felt more like a classic genre film than what I'd seen Hollywood in recent years.",0.2997,173

"As a standalone movie, these two are good.  Well done, acted and such.  Placed into the Star Wars universe, they suck.  For me its the bridge from RotJ to TFA.  It was poorly written, done, and thought out.  Take Luke, I'm to believe that a guy who fought hard to get where he was, faced Vader twice (and yes he won the last battle) suddenly 'gives up'.  He tosses it all away to seclude himself over one failure with his nephew?  I need more development than what was given to believe such a turn.  Remember, Luke is a character who has killed thousands.  Now if they had brought that up, along with this, and he thought it was too much, maybe I could see it.

Also, they could have made Luke go to TALK to Kylo and Snoke caused an illusion to make it APPEAR Luke was attacking.

I'm fundamentally against the idea that Luke tried to kill his Nephew, in his sleep! That's a wuss move and I reject that as Luke's character.

So now that he's dead and Ray already bested Not Vader in Episode 7 with no issues what so ever without training, what is there for them to struggle against?  
Plus with the Emperor, he was built up in Episode 5, and can be seen as something more powerful then Vader, along it being safe to assume that he was the one that brought Vader to the dark side, especially with the conflict between Luke and the Emperor.  While the Emperor was also easily defeated, the way he was defeated was by Vader wanting to save his son, with his goodness overcoming the darkness within Vader.

That's how wars work. Leia could have called the bombers off at any time, but she didn't. She then bitches at Poe for what? Saving their lives? In a way that she could have easily stopped had she had a moral issue with? WTF?!!! It took ONE SIMPLE COMM TRANSMISSION. Purple haired chick then proceeds to tell precisely no one about her plan. I mean seriously. Faith must be earned, not just blindly given. Unless they suspected a traitor, which they never even established, there is no reason why you couldn't even say, ""it's ok. I have a plan.""  And why did it have to be the enormous ship anyway? Wouldn't a smaller fighter be both faster, have a smaller surface area and thus result in a greater splitting force?

"I like your list but I do have some replies.

10. Snoke isn't the same as the emperor. It's hard to say it when he's the villain in a sequel of a established universe, not a new series. The thing is this guy not only lured Ben Solo to the dark side, he also took control of basically the empire and its remaining resources. Why and how he did it are, in my opinion, legit interesting questions that while are not essential to the story, might have added a lot more to the setting of these sequels. 
9. I haven't heard many people saying this hahaha but I actually think Kylo is the most interesting character in the new series. So him being the villain is actually cool.
8. Haven't heard much of this critique either, but in order for a series to progress, the status quo has to be challenged and changed if possible. The problem is in the ""how"" and that is another discussion. 
7. I actually find it OK that Rey's parents are nobody. The force isn't something that belongs to a family or race, it's supposed to be around every living thing. Now, my problem with that is that it doesn't explain why is she so good at everything with the force without training. I think people where expecting here to be either a Kenobi or Skywalker in order to justify her talent, but it would still mean she gained every single possible force ability from... basically nothing. There is still something missing there.
6. Luke actually thinking in killing Ben for a second is not the same as taking his lightsaber, walking all the way to his tent, igniting his weapon and raising it to strike down his nephew, the son of his sister and best friend. Now, this idea itself is not bad if you have something that would push Luke to consider taking that action. But the film's explanation is very weak in that aspect. Its a vision and he doesn't seem to consider any other option. 
5. I like this one actually hahaha. I agree that the way it is shown it looks silly, but the idea itself does make sense. Why wouldn't Leia learn to do something like that? It's been 30 years (like you said). 
4. Poe destroys the dreadnought and saves what's rest of the resistance. So it was a big sacrifice that actually had potential for a good arc, but it was handled poorly. Holdo's insistence of not saying the plan to Poe is understandable at first (to a degree...), but I don't get why she doesn't say anything when he takes over. Shouldn't that be the moment when she realizes ""Ok, this idiot is about to f*ck up everything. Might as well calm him down"". And when Poe does learn the plan, he openly says that it might work! So it is really confusing why that whole thing happened. Poe could've had a great arc regarding how much is he willing to sacrifice in order to win or how many lives can he endure losing in order to save more. 
3. Never heard that one too hahaha. It was just an emphasis to say that the force is available to many living things and not a certain few. Maybe a bit whimsical in how it was showed, but that's just my own view.
2. The plot to Kanto bay or Planet Monaco as I called felt pointless not because of the failure of the plan itself. If any, it gave Finn a bigger purpose. He starts the film by wanting to run away and ends up wanting to openly fight for the resistance. But the political messages, the freeing of the animals and slave children, all that felt... it felt like a bad timing for it. They supposedly are against time, losing people on the resistance every moment they delay and then they introduce all this commentary. I don't think the commentary is wrong, but why now or on this scene when the story supposedly dictates an emergency that needs to be resolved. The failure theme you mention is again, a really good idea and a good topic to discuss. But many people didn't see it (myself included) because there were many things distracting us from noticing it. 
1. I haven't heard this either. I guess I follow a different set of haters from this film. If a film challenges you, yeah, that doesn't make it automatically bad... nor good. 

I do think the film has a lot of good ideas behind it, but my problem was with the execution of many of them. I'm glad you saw the Failure theme because it is actually very interesting and yes, it's definitely there in the film. Sadly, I couldn't see it like you did because I found other things to be problematic and some characters just didn't cut it for me. While I don't think this is the worst Star Wars film and there are good moments and lines in it, I think there were many decisions that just didn't work. (don't know if anyone is going to read this whole comment haha)",0.9953,973
"I liked Andy Serkis' performance as Snoke n his Force powers n crisp dialogue which left me wanting 2 see n know more. The filmmakers decided to keep it a mystery. Fair enough but there r 2 reasons why the Emperor is a far more superior character at present n why it's unfair to compare Snoke to him as n excuse for a lack of backstory. 1. The Emperor is more original. Snoke just seems like n Emperor clone that was thrown in cause the writers needed a bad guy. I don't think this is the case. I think he has a backstory n a story purpose greater than just being a fall guy for Kylo but cause we don't find anything out it appears to be lazy writing n u could argue it doesn't even make sense. There's a huge gap regarding Snokes relationship to Luke?, how he seduced Ben? how he came to prominence in the Galaxy? How he is so powerful both in the Force n politically? What r his ultimate goals bar turning Kylo into a new Vader-like servant which isn't that interesting n we've seen it before anyway. He seemed shoehorned in just to fulfill Kylo's arc n to make a point about hubris leading to downfall but unless it was a big misdirection it was at the expense of his character. Just knowing a bit would help the story! The Emperor was set up perfectly. U hear about how powerful he is first, then see him as a hologram n then u see Vader kneeling to him in front of a vast part of the Empire which brings me to the next point. 2. He upped the stakes. U get the greatest villain of all time in Vader n then in ROTJ u see that there is someone even more powerful n it made the film more threatening n actually gave it some stakes. Kylo is a fantastic 3 dimensional character but as a villain despite knowing some neat Force tricks, he's kinda lame. Hasn't Rey already defeated him? The last thing is the Emperor worked great as a story device n a character cause he didn't need much backstory. U knew everything u needed to. He turned Vader n wants to turn Luke. He's a Hitler-type fascist who desires control over everything. He's the ruler of the Galaxy n he destroyed the Jedi Order n turned the Old Republic into n Empire. It ties everything together so that u understand the plot n dynamic between Vader, Luke n the Emperor. The ST is set in the future. There is a history now n Snoke's backstory is non-existent in the film so it's confusing to the audience? We know he turned Ben n that's about it? But I will say that after the Prequels it did add to the ROTJ plot n it helped u to understand ROTJ even better so maybe they were leaving Snoke or at least his backstory for EP9. It might make things a bit more interesting then or at least help serve the story n the plot so that it finally makes sense! I liked TLJ. I just wish they'd have put more backstory n lore into it to help us understand the story, characters' motivation's n their relationships to each other better. The Luke n Leia scene was emotional n great n the Luke n R2 scene! But stuff like Han's funeral could have been so powerful n given the characters some humanity n emotion. U get Rose mourning for her sister so why not a beloved character such as Han? The film seemed to be making a real point about letting go of the past but they didn't have to sideline the old characters(barring Leia) to such n extent! It could have fixed TFA scene too where Leia blanked Chewie after Han's death! It's strange cause I think RJ does get SW n does know what he's doing regarding the characters n it's story but a lot of it was left out for some reason n it left huge gaps where there could have been so much more depth. Maybe it has been left for 9?",0.9906,751

"I wouldn't necessarily care about Snoke not having a backstory in every case.  Sometimes having unexplained vistas in a story can add to the narrative effect and make the world feel bigger and more mysterious.  

However, the problem with Snoke is that TFA created a background setting which didn't make any damn sense in the larger context of SW.  Where did the First Order come from?  Why was nothing accomplished after Episode 6?  Why is the Resistance the Resistance?  Shouldn't they be ruling and the First Order are the rebels?  

I was willing to overlook those questions after TFA because it seemed to be setting up some explanations.  

If the background setting of TFA had logically followed from Episode 6, I wouldn't at all mind to have a mysterious villain come from somewhere unknown and then die without being explained.  Sounds interesting.  

But instead of being interestingly mysterious, Snokes case simply makes it feel like the setting of the story doesn't have any depth.  It makes it feel like he was created without any thought, to look scary and be vaguely derivative of the emporer, rather than to add any substance to the plot. 

More background wasn't needed for the Emporer because a logical setting had already been created prior to his introduction.  There is a ruling Empire, there is a Rebellion.  It makes sense for the ruling Empire to have a leader.  I don't need to know his whole life story for the character to be believable and be a logical part of the story.  

But when you get TFA and TLJ, there has already been lots of background setting and context created by the previous 6 movies.  You can't just chuck it all out the window with no logical explanation.

If you disagree, hopefully this is at least an intelligent critique.  Btw, I didn't mind at all the lack of background w Rey's parents, because there wasn't anything illogical about that.  I thought it was awesome and her humble background is much more interesting to me than if she had been a Skywalker or something.",0.6467,378
"I'd like to have an actual civil debate on this. Because I liked this movie, I just wasn't in love with it. And the more times you watch it the wider the plotholes get. So...

Here is the thing...They made the entire First Order look like a joke in this film. It isn't just about Snoke or Kylo or any singular issue. Not one member of the order seems competent. I'll explain my thoughts on our bad guys down here as shortly as possible. 

Kylo blows up at the drop of a hat and destroys things. They keep playing with the idea of redemption but very few people actually want to see that moment. With both Han and Luke and Leia all gone now(they already said Leia wont be returning after Carrie's sad death) who is he going to connect with? Rey? That is an abusive relationship waiting to happen.

Snoke who can mind meld people couldn't tell his apprentice was about to off him in the worst way possible. They built him up so heavily and then let it fall flat.

Phasma(a commander of the troopers.) is knocked out by a single hit and taken prisoner in one movie. And is written out equally badly in this one. She was basically there to be used for trash compactor jokes and Boba Fett deaths.

Hux ignores the entire Rebel fleet to deal with what amounts to a prank call that ultimately ends in the destruction of one of their Dreadnaught Star Destroyers. He later calmly chases low fuel rebellion ships for 18 hours so the B characters can go off and have a side plot that actually accomplishes nothing. Seriously...You can say the learned from failure...But it kind of detracts from it if the -entire- movie is failure. Or that it takes 30+ minutes to do. That story serves 0 purpose and kills the flow. He could have easily jumped ahead 1 or 2 of their ships to catch the fleet. Or better yet? Shot the psycho(Ren) in the head while he was unconscious and taken control himself.

Knights of Ren who have had less screen time than Phasma and are all more than likely former students of Luke. Who would have been a GREAT addition...In this film...When Luke was still alive.

Now...Pair all of this up with sad storylines, butchering of characters and the biggest let down of a character return possible(Luke) and it is easy to see why fans are upset. People wanted a story to come full circle. For instance...Show Luke stand on the edge of that cliff and look at the X wing in the water. Let him look back at Yoda's force ghost one more time then show him raising the ship out unlike on dagobah when he failed. He can then go and confront Kylo in person at least.",-0.9907,540

"Marley James, where was this explained? At what point in either movie is it elaborated that she's the chosen one?

You want me to elaborate? Okay. TFA sets-up their master/apprentice relationship. Snoke orders Hux bring Kylo to him to complete his training after Starkiller base is destroyed. This does not get any payoff. There's no mention of his training or his completely abandoning the light by killing Han. Snoke instead berates Kylo for losing to Rey and mocks his helmet. That's it, JJ set-up that Kylo would complete his training and this is completely abandoned in TLJ. I forgot another one. The map and Luke Skywalker. There's all this guff about a map and how to find Luke and TLJ just ignores the why. Why did Luke decidd to leave a map to his location with R2, when he claims he purposefully came to ""the hardest to find place in the galaxy"", in order to die? Kind of defeats the purpose of not wanting to be found, if you leave a map showing where you can be found.

I'm not requesting everything be spoon fed, but we're not talking about Primer here or a David Lynch flick. We're talking about Star Wars, a fantasy series based on adventure serials. There needs to be some reason for the conflict and motivations and characters need some development. Killing a character who is presented to be grand and important, capable of turning the galaxy back on its heels, as Palpatine and the Empire did, is not good writing. And don't give me this subversion crap. It's subversion for the sake of it. If Rian wants to subvert expectations, the least he can do is be clever about it, not just throw it in because ""hey that's unexpected."" It's the narrative equivalent of a Family Guy cutaway gag.

But instead we get nothing; no explanation of what he wants or where he comes from. This is especially disappointing to most viewers because he was very mysterious in TFA and it hinted at a lot of backstory to come. For instance, his age; is very clear he is old. How Old?
Was he alive for the galactic civil war, or even the fall of the Jedi? What was he doing during that time? was he once a Jedi that went into hiding?

"My response to these reasons:

10. ""Snoke was just a clever misdirection."" As a writer I know that building a character up to be this big powerful character is something you don't want to screw up. And them just killing him off the way they did was such a terrible way, the least they could have done is give us some explanation as to who he is. Answer this simple question: Who is he and what is his back story? Sure you can kill him off in the second film, but don't have it in such a dumb way, at least have him die in an interesting way. And then you go on about the Emperor in the Original Trilogy. Let me explain why it was such a big deal. He was Luke's true test along side redeeming his father. And the reason it was such a great scene is because Luke nearly died due to Sidious's Force Lightning, and then Vader betrayed his master and killed him. It was far less expected and was an amazing story moment too. Where as Kylo killing Snoke was such a dumb thing, the only way they could redeem Snoke is have him come back but as an entity of the Force. Here is what I propose and what I've heard others say: Snoke is such a powerful Force user that his body can't handle his own powers, and with his body's demise his true power can be shown as a Force ghost (even though Dark Side users can't become force ghosts for some fucking reason. Explain how Darth Vader became a Force ghost after his death. -Fucking hell-)

9. Well...He was always the villain, I just saw him as a shitty Darth Revan wannabe. So you've got a good point there, I'll agree with you there. _However_, I would like to see the plot point in TLJ where Kylo said that MaRey Sue is actually inline with the Dark Side, and MaRey Sue said that Kylo still has good in him happens. I want to see that flip in sides happen, and then the final film involves Finn trying to redeem MaRey Sue and turn her back to the Light side. That would be a better story than what TFA and TLJ had.
Also General Ginger really isn't much of a character, and the Knights of Ren _really_ need to show up. Seriously, without them it just feels like the films are missing any real tension or mystery.

8. Uh...Literally nothing significant happened. MaRey Sue learned a few things in the Force, Snoke died, and the Resistance was fucking obliterated to the point that every member could fit on the Falcon. What. The. Fuck! You say you don't understand why people were interested in MaRey Sue being trained, but the fucking point of MaRey Sue going to Luke was: 1. To get him to come to the Resistance. 2. To train her. Seriously the fight in TFA between MaRay Sue and Kylo Ren was a joke because she had yet to have any training. As someone who's studied HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts. Aka sword fighting) I can tell you that knowing how to fight with a staff is nothing like fighting with a sword. So far she has had _two Lightsaber lessons_ and has beaten Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker. What. The. Fuck!.....Oh, and they established that anyone who's Force sensitive can use the Force without any training at the end with that slave kid Force Pulling a broom to themselves. 

7. We want an explanation to who the fuck MaRey Sue is. I mean ""Your parents were nobody, they sold you for drinking money."" is such a dumb line. Of course it could of been Kylo trying to manipulate MaRey Sue, but seriously, that is some lazy fucking writing there. I was behind the idea that she was Luke's daughter, which would have been cool. But a better explanation was that she was a member of the Jedi Temple Luke set up, but was taken away by her ""parents"" and then she was sold for drinking money. There you go, there is an explanation as to why she is Force sensitive. Infantile Amnesia would be the reason why she doesn't remember her Force abilities and the Mary Sue argument would be lessened.

6. Considering that he tried to redeem his father, and only fought back in episode 6 in self defense it's a pretty strong argument. _However,_ he only considered it for a moment and realized how terrible of an idea it was a moment later. It was a good character building moment. Also...I think you need to know a little something something about the Force...The Light Side of the Force is about resisting the temptations of the Dark, in other words: Resisting emotions. The Jedi tell you to distance yourself from everyone you're close to so you can not be tempted. And the Dark Side is embracing the emotions that come with being attached to someone or something. In the words of Jolee Bindo ""The Jedi, with their damnable sense of over-caution, would tell you love is something to avoid. Thankfully, anyone who's partially alive knows that's not true. Love doesn't lead to the Dark Side. Passion can lead to rage and fear, and can be controlled...But passion is not the same thing as love. Controlling your passions while being in love...That's what they should teach you to beware. But love itself, will save you...Not condemn you""

5. Do you understand how space works? If you do you should understand that Leia is dead, no argument about it. She is dead via two ways: One, the pressure of space would have forced the air within her out and force her throat. And two, water boils in a vacuum, and that means that Leia's blood would have boiled, and in 13 seconds her brain would have turned into mush.

4. If Admiral Purple Hair had just told Poe the fucking plan the mutiny would never have happened, and the Rose and Finn sub plot never would have been needed. You want to know what I would have done? The second time Poe asks for orders Admiral Purple Hair grabs Poe by the arm, drags him close and whispers the plan in his ear. We don't hear the plan but Poe looks at her conflicted for a moment, and then nods in approval. It leaves the audience wondering what the plan is, but it doesn't cause any complaints.
And also, remember Poe lost 30 people at the least, but killed 10,000 people at the least. #PoeDidNothingWrong 
*ALSO THE FIRST ORDER DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THE TRANSPORTS BECAUSE OF POE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FUCKING CODE BREAKER THAT FINN AND ROSE PICKED UP!*

3. My issue is that the kid has no Force training. That's all. I've not seen anyone saying that there will be a film of that kid at all. Maybe you should have shown a screenshot of where you've seen those statements because that's an anecdotes. You aren't giving a reliable argument by not showing any proof. You could easily be lying about this.

2. The B Plot? It's called a sub plot. Calling it a B Plot through me off to such a degree I had to look up what a B Plot is. And worst of all you didn't specify what the ""B Plot"" was anyways. Was it the Finn and Rose sub plot? The Luke and MaRey Sue sub plot? And then you go on about the theme of the movie. What. The. Fuck! Point number 2 was supposed to be about the sub plot, but instead of talking about it you talk about the theme of the movie. Make your bloody mind, jeez.

1. Ok...You want to know the issue? It movie went against the grain so much that it goes against it's core demographic: White Males. Every white male in the movie is either evil, stupid, or weak where as every female character is strong, graceful, and powerful. Do you see the issue? This movie is a fuck you to men, and that's why it has a 49% on Rotten Tomatoes. Seriously, tell me one character in TLJ who is a white male, and is a strong character? The only person I could say is, is Poe. But the movie does it's best to make him look like he did everything wrong, where it was really the other way around.",-0.9974,1619

I think the movie does challenge pretty much every preconception that the fanbase had. Just because you are not willing to be challenged and not willing to acknowledge the attempt doesn't mean the challenge is not there. 

Rey doesn't really need to get trained, because she has already shown she is a prodigy. But she does manage to learn some things from Luke despite his resistance. A lot of people didn't like that Luke was the way he was, but there has to be a very good reason he has been in exile on that island instead of off fighting the first order. And that reason makes the other option more likely, not less. 

Snoke not being the main villain is one of the preconceptions I'm talking about. The assumption by many is that he is the villain, like the emperor of this trilogy. But the reality is that the character was entirely a misdirection. Kylo Ren is the main villain, it's just that the character arc began at a point before Kylo Ren was ready to fulfill that role. The payoff of the real plot, not the misdirection, will be in the next movie, when he will be the Supreme Leader of the First Order. That's why it helps to reserve judgement until you can see the whole story.

I have heard so many complaints about The Last Jedi, and I have to say, the vast majority of those complaints are stupid, shortsighted, lazy and childish. The reality is that many people have failed as viewers. They want a simple formulaic story, like a live action version of Star Wars Rebels, which is a show written for 8 year olds. Many wanted something more like what they read in the atrocious EU novels. And thankfully, LucasFilm is not unwilling to upset some people to try to bring us something that has a chance to be far better.",-0.9576,389

Ok two things can make a character boring. one is poor writing and the other is ones opinion. Kylo being unpredictable doesn't make him more threatening or harder to over come. He is interesting in a wow what a crazy person kind of way but not as a main villain.     The writer is who creates a character so if the character is dull then yes the writer made him that way. If the writer intended to make snoke dull then yes that is poor writing. An uninteresting character = who cares. He was interesting in awakens so that means Rian made him dull and uninteresting.,0.6694,113
Okay first of all the reason people let it go about not knowing much about palpatine is because at the time George Lucas had announced his plans for 9 episodes. So everyone knew that the back story was going to be explained in a prequel trilogy. Snoke was good but at the end of the day he is a palpatine knock off and he should have gotten some type of back story. Just because the original trilogy didn't palpatine a backstory doesn't mean the same formula was going to work again with Snoke.,0.6542,97
"On #4: I don’t think this works, for a couple reasons: Firstly (more minor of a point), there was no way for The rebel fighters and bombers to disengage quickly enough to flee with the fleet, the retreat Lea was ordering was physically impossible, and the casualties they had sustained would have been lost in vain, Secondly it was stated that Holdo had won a major victory leading up to the mutiny plot, and that it had cost a great deal of life in order to do so; If this was the case how is Holdo any different to Poe?

"Regarding Holdo: I disagree that her actions were smart. Hiding not just the plan, but the existence of a plan, from an officer with loyal subordinates and a known history of acting impulsively is not a good idea.

BUT: First, it's understandable, because she got thrust into command during a hellish time, and half of the chain of command was floating outside in hard vacuum. That shit can get to anyone, she didn't want to deal with Poe and didn't fully trust him, and as a result made a mistake.

Second... every hero makes mistakes in this film. Luke gives Kylo the last push to the Dark Side, Rey thinks she can redeem Kylo by going to him, Poe gets a fuckton of people killed, Finn and Rose get the wrong slicer who betrays them, Chewie roasts a Porg which, as a sea bird, likely tastes just awful (imagine eating a seagull)... the Hero's fucking up and getting people killed is one of the major themes of the film. Why wouldn't that extend to Holdo?

He was also the primary obstacle for Luke turning Vader back to the light. Side note: Vader told Luke that together they could destroy the Emperor in ESB and then says that he must obey his master.  It's too late for him. Plot hole?  Anyway, Snoke is nothing but a plot device. Knowing his back story would add nothing to the narrative because it isn't integral to the story.

oh my god, she just said that fact that we don't know kylo's motivation makes him more interesting. character motivation isn't that important? Jenny, I don't think you care much about villains.

the reason rey's parents should not be nobodyies is because it was not set up that way in episode 7. You clearly don't care about structure or continuity, or logic, or star wars haha.

Villains Act, Heros React, but the Heroes seem too active, and the villains to reactive? I think that’s why Kylo comes off as a weak villain, he never has the initiative, except for the scene where he asks Rey to join him, which seems to me like his seminal moment in the film.

"The Last Jedi was a piss poor fan fic of a movie. The characters are now disposable, with no need to be disposable, and worse yet, they are introduced, but no gravity to their character is given. There is a big evil guy, aaaaand he's dead. In the original trilogy, the Emperor is seeded throughout, built up, and when he is actually on screen, there is tension and a sense of who he is. Snoke comes off who looked big in Force Awakens, then appears in Last Jedi, and the tension is gone. Snoke was a nothing-burger, and it was a let down and waste of character. Instead, we get a emo-man-child who will blubber and man-trum his was through the next film. The villain doesn't show menace, and that will reflect on the heroes, which is pretty boring now. General Hux is the closest thing to an actual baddie, but he's shown as a incompetent boob. At least Grand Moff Tarkin in the original came off as cool, confidant, calculating, and competent as a leader. 

A hero is defined by the villain. If the villain is easily defeated, it gives no boost the hero. There is no challenge, there is so struggle, and this makes the overall story weak. Negan doesn't come off as a whiny bad guy, he literally scares the shit outta people with his unpredictability, but more than that, his ability to follow through with it. Kylo Ren just fawns over Vader's mask and throws tantrums. Wow, very scary. He never shows any real menace, and doesn't make the heroes look good. 

As for the rest... you need to study the structure of good story telling. There was practically nothing in the film that was good story telling. Plots that go nowhere, and a throwaway plot that resulted in nothing. For what? The movie could have had none of the Finn/Rose subplot. It was a huge waste of our time.",-0.8096,378

Love and hate, good and evil blah blah blah. Love wins
 But, even if you were right. there nothing wrong with snoke getting killed soon. He was never suggested to be an important character of the franchize. Maybe you are confused: ultra powerful and ugly is not equal to important.
 And if it dissappointed you, maybe thats the point, he wasn't as smart as he thought he was, and he died because of that: he didn't learn from past mistakes (Palpatine's Mistakes). Palpatine was pretty dumb (he practically commited suicide with his ""trap"" for the rebels), glad we didn't have two of those.
 The only thing that may have been suggested as important for the sequel trilogy: is the idea of having a superpowerful being coming from unknown regions of the galaxy. Not Snoke, but the existence of something like snoke may be an issue to explore (either in movies or expanded universe).
 And there is what the girl in the video says: the idea of snoke is to mislead. You are angry because the movie missleaded you. So every movie with unexpected surprises are bad, just because. The problem is not that Snoke dies, the problem is that Snoke goes full dumb a second before he dies. He stops being interesting the second before dying.
 Palpatine was not an important character of the original trilogy, he was the ultimate goal; but the nemesis is Vader. Same here with Snoke: what is interesting is that this happens in a really different fashion in comparison to the OT, and in the second act of the second movie: which leaves a cool horizon to explore. Now we don't know what can happen in the next one.

Its important that us ""the audience"" think that Snoke is a big deal, so to subbert those expectations: he is a big deal for the galaxy, but not for our story (Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo story). You know, because this trilogy theme is all about ""lets talk about Starwars"". So they grow things in a way that looks like the OT once again, but its not. Kylo is not a vader 2, but a Vader cosplayer. Rey is not a Luke 2, but a Star Wars fanboy. The first order are young Empire revivalists. And snoke is snoke, everything told about him is just to mirror the emperor: he seduces guys to the dark, he is superpowerful, he is an egomaniac, he think he is on top of everything, he is superdumb, he dies a second after the audience gets tired of him as being this knowitall bad guy filled with exposition that he is. We don't need to know his background to understand this character and his role in this story.
   But no, there was actually nothing to be explained about Snoke. He is just the supreme leader, an all powerfull all respected (by the bad guys) old man. Thats all we need to know.
 In fact if you know about storytelling as you say you do. You should know that every information that doesn't work for the actual story and its characters, its not only redundant but also deviates and confuses from whatever the story is trying to tell. The story does not address Kylo and Snoke, it addresses Kylo and Luke.
 And you should do some kind of study about ""what expectations did the movie set up"". Because i only heard expectations about Snoke from fanboys and fan theorists; not by any casual star wars fans, or casual moviegoer. 
I (and so many others) didn't go to the theater with your questions. Those are questions that maybe an old EU fan can make. But not a starwars films fan: the galaxy is filled with adventure and unexplored areas. There was an emperor who also was a strong sith, there is a Supreme Leader that is also super strong with the force: no need for further info to follow and enjoy the story.

"There is a big difference between Snoke dying and the Red Wedding. The Red Wedding is set-up way in advance. Rob is warned about Walder Frey time and time again. Characters talk about how untrustworthy is and how concerned he is with respect and that he has long felt disrespected by the lords of other houses, particularly the Starks. Rob is warned that in breaking his promises he has cost himself the war. He is warned that his decisions are alienating allies. We are told endlessly of the cunning of Tywin Lannister.  We are told that the characters are relying on ""guest rights"" and tradition to protect them.

The Red Wedding doesn't confound expectations by executing a sudden change in the direction of the plot. It's a natural consequence of the actions and characters that have been set up well in advance. It's the same with Ned's execution, he's warned over and over again that he is out of his depth. He's told not to trust people. He's told that his ""honour"" will get him killed. There is nothing in the story that should make us think that Ned is going to survive for long in King's Landing. 

 The Snoke ending would be like Game of Thrones if instead of getting his head chopped off,  GRRM had Ned give a signal and the Hound and Ser Ilyn Payne suddenly turned around and killed all the Lannisters, and that secretly Ned had been playing everyone from the beginning.

I hope someone resurrects Darth Bane and have him kill Kylo, Rey, Rose and take over the First Order. He was a Sith that got shit done. Let's just say I fear for Star Wars at this point because of everyone saying garbage like ""Oh! It's subversive."" ""Oh! It's just Star Wars/a movie."" That doesn't excuse anything. Now, nothing matters in these movies. There is no plot to go off of. The big bad is dead and got replaced by a whiny brat (who was good in TFA, but is now shit). MaRey Sue is as OP as ever. Finn, Poe and Rose are pointless. Just what is this movie? Cuz I'll tell you what it isn't: good. You know it's bad if the fans hated it from Day 1.

"This vid's defense is as vapid and lacking in literary understanding as the movie itself.  She does not understand that she doesn't understand.  

For example, the ""status quo"" not changing.  At the end of Ep4 the rebels have the upper hand.  The empire is reeling.  Vader is defeated, the Death Star destroyed, and a new Jedi trainee has been found.  At the end of Ep5, the rebels have been routed on Hoth, the heroes have been defeated on Bespin, Luke has grown in his training and survived his first fight with Vader, and Luke has found his father.  Plus we can add that questions raised in Ep4 were answered in Ep5 and now we can't wait to have questions raised in Ep5 be answered in Ep6.    The sequels fail at this.  The status quo doesn't change much if at all between Ep7 and Ep8.  The Resistance goes from defeated to defeated worse.  The First Order goes from winning to winning.  Rey goes from Jedi Master to Jedi Master again (she gains/loses nothing).  Finn goes from failed hero to failed hero.  Luke goes from ""gone"" to (sigh) ""gone again.""  What did change was Leia gets Force powers for a second then doesn't use them again ever.  Snoke goes from mysterious mastermind to pointless meat.  Kylo is no more evil or powerful than before but he does take Snoke's seat.  So when people say ""the status quo doesn't change"" they're referring to the status of the major actors and situations.  And they barely budge in TLJ.  One of these movies is irrelevant now.  You'll be able to jump from Ep 7 to Ep 9--or skip Ep 7 and start with Ep 8--with only minimal gaps in story knowledge.  

And when people say TLJ changed things too much, they're not talking about the same elements as those who say it didn't change anything.  Completely different set of facts for each topic.  TLJ changes too much of what's supposed to stay consistent within a serialized world and changes too little of the current trilogy story which is supposed to change in a second act of a trilogy.  For example, the Force and Luke's personality.   I hope this helps.",0.0349,420

WTF relating snoke to the red wedding is very stupid. there was no emotional attachment!! REALLY?,-0.8485,20
"Watched this again just now, and now it kinda makes sense. Im not sure why I was so disappointed. Snoke didn't need a backstory, Leia-Poppins is fine, Kylo is cool as a mercurial villain, the status quo WAS destroyed, Rey's training isn't necessary to her being a jedi, Holdo was a part of the military command and didn't NEED to tell Po, Finn and Rose were ok, etc.. Low key, I STILL don't know why I am disappointed. I guess it wasn't my movie. But whatever the reason...its difficult to rewatch. 
If I had to dredge up a reason now... I think the irritating thing is the trope of Angel in love with a Demon (Rey's dramatic tension with Kylo feeding Rey-lo theories), is done very often and those fan theories are too easy/cheap. All of the Star Wars aspects I was expecting to see,  only being replaced with the quasi-romantic tension of the ""bad boy's redemption by the love of a good girl""..It felt more like fan-fiction than an actual movie. 
GRANTED that trope exists FOR A REASON. I love stories like Phantom of the Opera for that reason. I love the ideas of redemption/self-condemnation, the battle between two forces fighting against one another because they are drawn to each other by love. But its SO EASY to do badly, with movies like 50 Shades, Twilight, all painfully coming to mind. And while an argument could be made that TLJ was one of the stories that HAS done it well, the flop between a dramatic (yet sometimes cheesy) space opera like Star Wars to a story even slightly resembling a steamy WattPad fan-fic left a bad taste in my mouth.",-0.8434,325

"You aren't coming up with very good arguments against these issues, and you are over simplifying them in the process. Half the time you accidentally point out even more flaws. Like you basically saying ""Kylo Ren is so hot and deep that he doesn't need to be a good villian"".

Let me you a ""what if"" story. What if Luke saw the darkness in Kylo and was horrified, then went to talk to Leia and Han about what to do. Kylo Ren spies on them. Han says something insensitive, but not murderous, however because of Kylo hearing it out of context or because of Snoke's influence, he takes it the wrong way and goes back and kills the students. Luke returns and is heartbroken at what he finds (no everyone and their mother beating Luke necessary). Because of what he heard, this leads Kylo Ren to the point he is able to kill his own father.

Wouldn't that make more sense for Luke's character? I'm not saying it's great writing but it isnt completely OC like what they put in the story. And it develops Kylo Ren in the process.

Luke didn't have a ""passing thought"". He went full blown murder mode on a person he has known since they were born. A person that he has a relationship with, and a duty towards. Unlike with Darth Vader, where he voluntarily put himself in harm's way just to save his father. He didn't have to go to Vader, heck he could've killed Vader. But he didn't, and that was in the heat of battle.

Say, for an analogy, Luke is a person who would never cheat on his significant other. A passing thought (like a passing thought to kill Kylo Ren) would have been like seeing a hot girl on the street and thinking she was sexy. But what Luke did (actually going to kill Kylo) was more like getting his pants around his ankles and getting ready to insert, only stopping at the last minute. That would be completely at odds with someone who doesnt even normally think about cheating. You see the difference?

Plus, while I believe everyone should be allowed to enjoy what they enjoy, when Mark Hamill says he fundamentally disagrees with everything they did to his character, and when George Lucas equates the new trilogy (and selling to Disney) to selling his children to white slavers, you know you are doing something wrong.",-0.9959,463

"You're getting a lot of naysayers in this comment section, but I'm with you. In my mind, criticisms of The Last Jedi fall into two categories: Subverted expectations, and actual filmmaking problems. So many of the most common criticisms fall into the former category, and these are not valid. Luke being a flawed character does not a bad film make. Snoke's identity being unimportant is not to the film's detriment. The themes of failure are not a strike against it, and there's so many aspects of this movie that are exceptionally good. That said, there ARE actual complaints to discuss - Canto Bight being one, Superleia another. These are problems that persist if you allow yourself to view the film on it's own terms.

Rob and Catelyn like many classical greek heroes are full of virtues but have also great flaws in the end their flaws bring their downfall even when they were both strong and competent. The porpouse of the catarsis is to realize the value of good through the ultimate victory of evil, both Roose Bolton and Walder Frey won yet they are not portrayed as heroic or even redemable but rather it showcase their greed and pettiness, it is a cautionary tale against that sort of behavior. On the contrary Snoke has no background or distinc personality, he is ""lame""as you put it, his death just bring confusion to the audience and serve no other porpouse than to troll the viewer, punishing him for being emotionaly involved and that seems to be the case with many scenes in the film, its almost like Rian Johnson playing a joke to the audience and then lafting at them.
