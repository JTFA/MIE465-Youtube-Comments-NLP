"*LYRICS* 

""Whole Heart""

There's so much I don't know about you and I'm dying to
Tackle the recent obstacle that's keeping me from you
We were at the beach and you were hiding on your phone
You said nothing's wrong, but something's wrong
You know my insecurities are always there alone
And I can show my weaknesses, it's something to be proud
God, it'd be so beautiful to see that side of you
All the messy parts, every part, your whole, whole heart

So come on, baby, open up
I swear you won't be sorry
You know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry
Ooh, nah nah nah, ooh, nah nah nah
I want your whole, whole heart, give me that
Ooh, nah nah nah, ooh, nah nah nah
I want your whole, whole heart, lay it on me

There's something in your head that you can't seem to get around
Ghosts of past relationships that only let you down
Tell me all your darkest secrets, baby, try me out
I'll walk you through, just me and you
You doubt I could be your safety net
What now? Why don't you just love me?
And why doubt all all of my intentions?
You got my attention, my whole, whole heart

So come on, baby, open up
I swear you won't be sorry
You know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry
Ooh, nah nah nah, ooh, nah nah nah
I want your whole, whole heart, give me that
Ooh, nah nah nah, ooh, nah nah nah
I want your whole, whole heart, lay it on me

You doubt I could be your safety net
What now? Why don't you just love me?
And why doubt all all of my intentions?
You got my attention, my whole, whole heart
So come on, baby, open up
You know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry

So come on, baby, open up
I swear you won't be sorry
You know I never ever judge
I swear you won't be sorry
Ooh, nah nah nah, ooh, nah nah nah
I want your whole, whole heart, give me that
Ooh, nah nah nah, ooh, nah nah nah
I want your whole, whole heart, lay it on me

Whole, whole heart
I want your whole, whole heart",-0.9945,453

"Must admit, if just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Azerbaijan (I guess you even don't know where this country is). I do know that folks always make these comments, but I believe that I will be the one you'll be excited you decided to listen to. If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 3 minutes.",0.9815,109
