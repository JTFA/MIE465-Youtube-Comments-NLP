"I personally love the video. It is basically an emphasis of two songs in one, Fake Happy and Rose Colored Boy. (In case you see similar comments with this one, know that this comment is genuine and comes specifically from my observation) To answer why it was chosen as a broadcasting video clip or whatever is because what we see on screen is fabricated just to make people think they're ""fine"". Here are some stuff I can say about the opening. The name is ""Wake Up, Roseville!"" To me it says that wake up, realize that the world is like this, behind the scenes. Coffee is one of the emphasized points, as it signifies ""being awake"". Later on, Hayley Williams (I might spell it wrong) realizes that she is trapping herself in. And this is where regret comes in; ""Hayley, what are you doing?"" It's asking how or what the actual heck have you been doing all these years. Now we get this scene of Hayley asking what ""play us out"" is (note: it's actually a reference to a certain leaked footage or something) and so on. Goes rampant and does what she does, thus, becoming free ❤ 

This was pretty rushed though. Anyways I do hope there are more beautiful mvs to come",0.9665,254

"Little does everyone know when Paramore initially started that Taylor York was one of the first members besides Josh, Zac, and another friend of theirs. Hayley and Jeremy had been in a band called ""the Factory"" and heard that Paramore needed a lead singer and brought Jeremy along with her. After meeting the band Jeremy stated, ""we're gonna play with these kids?"". Due to personal reasons Taylor York and their other friend opted out of the band and so Hayley asker her Neighbor ""Jason Bynum"" to assume the role of Rythm Guitarist and so on etc.",0.8316,110
