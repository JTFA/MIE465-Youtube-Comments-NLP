"I wish my Italian mom could have watched your video.  She always had to mix foundations, Alexandra DeMarkoff, to get a color that wasn't red, she was very dark olive toned.  In the '60's women who were brown didn't have a lot of options.  Then mom married my Pops and he was like one chromosome away from an albino, and I am the combo kid.  In the summer, I am a nice medium neutral shade.  In the winter, I am like a pink olive.  We used to go to cosmetic counters to challenge the MA's.  There are so many skin tones, and companies like Fenty have made cosmetics that suit almost all skin tones.  I have to use two different foundations myself, and I have a light one for winter, and one a little darker in the summer.  I am 120 in Fenty in the winter and a 130 in the summer.  In between seasons, I mix accordingly.  My mom used to powder right after she put her moisturizer on before her foundation, and I thought she was nuts.  I saw you do it, and now it makes perfect sense.  My Gramma H taught me about ""setting"" your makeup.  Se would tap a little Coty Air Spun on her face, around her eyes, around her mouth, her nose and fore head and she would sweep off the excess.  She used a brush much like Besame's brush. Now, the kids call it baking It's so nice to see you ask about inclusion.  Perhaps now, cosmetic companies need to know that women who buy cosmetics are all different colors, just not the light complexions.  My mom would have loved this video and you for making it.",0.9716,326
