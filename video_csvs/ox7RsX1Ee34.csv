Damn, all of us

Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
(Another world premier!)
So give me a run for my money
Sipping bubbly, feeling lovely, living lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you

If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)
Keep it a hundred, I‚Äôd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothing

Ay, I got something (I got something)
Hol‚Äô up, we gon' function, no assumptions
Feeling like Tyson wit' it, knock it out twice
I'm with it, only for the night, I'm kidding
Only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean, I know what comin‚Äô over mean
Backstroke oversea, I know what you need
Already on ten, our money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don‚Äôt drought
This party won't end

If I didn‚Äôt ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothing

Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sipping bubbly, feeling lovely, living lovely

I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you

I‚Äôm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Popping your gum on the way
Am I in the way?
I don't want to pressure you none
I want your blessing today
Oh by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude for your nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yup

If didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothing

"Thanks. Sharing is caring .Dear friend ,ARE YOU SAVED ? IF YOU DIED TONIGHT WILL YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?
The Bible says: God is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect. God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven.
Have you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes .This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.
    The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.
 John 3:16 says: ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.‚Äù
So Christ died on the cross for our sins.
         
                        WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?
1- Admit you are a sinner.
                                    2-Be willing to turn from your sins and turn to God (repent).
                                    3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead. Romans 10:9 say: ‚Äúthat if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.‚Äù
                                    4-Now through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal savior.
                                     5- Pray this prayer of salvation :( Say it aloud)
Dear God, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again the thirth day.
I am willing to turn from my sins .I ask you to forgive me Father.
I now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Savior. Amen.
NOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                   
1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better.
2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.
3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.
4-Tell others about Jesus.
NB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.
