"Lyrics

I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Why, are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set? My arms, I stretch, but I can‚Äôt reach A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as Soon as I grab, squeeze I lose my grip like the flying trapeze Into the dark, I plummet Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark‚Äôs high Butterflies rip apart my stomach Knowing that no matter what bars I come with You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis I feel the ice cracking, because I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes It's the curse of the standard That the first of the Mathers disc set Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet Will this step just be another misstep To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark ‚Äôtil I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart Like, ""this shit is garbage"" God‚Äôs given me all this Still I feel no different regardless Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded If only they knew, it's a facade and it‚Äôs exhaustive And I try to not listen to nonsense But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence Mission accomplished I'm not God-sent Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes 'Cause I'm only human, just like you Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest A flawed human, I guess But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations And meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom? There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun Am I lucky to be around this long? Begs the question, though Especially after the methadone As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground And all that's left of my house is lawn The crowds are gone And it's time to wash out the blonde Sales decline, the curtains drawn They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind And everyone who has doubt, remind Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine 'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine? But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes 'Cause I'm only human, just like you I been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh If I walked on water, I would drown 'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike So me and you are not alike Bitch, I wrote ""Stan""",0.9816,785
