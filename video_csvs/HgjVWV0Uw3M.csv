"""Nostalgia and good visuals""... thats all SW is anyway. Throw a fucking lightsaber in there and we are done. Can't and no Jedi? Fine. Throw the falcon and a blaster and we're done. Thats all we need for SW. End of story. You either love the universe or you dont. Having that said, ofcourse we don't know if the film will be any good. It was a fucking teaser. Film can be a pile of shit for all we know. I personally am on the fence so far on the new Solo. Moments worked for me, others did not, some felt like ""copying"" a little the past, smirk smartass feel was a little off... or... something. Thats if I am nitpicking. Otherwise, teaser was bitching as far as teasers go.",-0.3628,157

"Didn't do anything for me. The visuals look fine and what one would expect from Star Wars. But the main actor I feel may be a an issue. I'm not exactly confident that even with the aid of an acting coach that he has the charisma necessary to embody the character of Han Solo. I know it's probably hard for a new actor to step into the shoes of a character played by someone else that technically exists in the same canon. 

Unlike Josh Brolin in MIB3 (who I liked in that movie)? We already have a precedent for a young Han Solo as Harrison Ford was pretty young when he played Solo.

"Great discussion on the solo trailer! Although I think Kristian doesn't wanna get burned by a disappointing film, his argument kinda just turned into an argument about film marketing.

But you can't turn the argument around and start telling people they're only hooked because of cool images, it's not really fair and can come across as a little undermining but I know Kristian had no bad intentions and is just passionate about Star Wars and wants this movie to be great like the rest of us!

"I totally understand withholding judgement on Solo until you see more. What I do not understand is the apparent hostility towards it when your primary reasoning is the divided opinions regarding TLJ when your review of that film was quite positive. It just smells like jumping on the anti-Disney-Star Wars bandwagon after the fact and I'm pretty sure that the others on the panel were thinking the same thing. I for one very much enjoyed The Last Jedi...I was not especially stoked about a Han Solo movie...But after seeing the trailer I am cautiously optimistic. Unfortunately I think it will not perform well due to the negative backlash towards TLJ and the short time period between these two films. They should have stuck to the pattern of December releases and given us one film every year. As it stands I'm guessing Solo will get bashed by the same apathetic ""fans"" and it will get lost in the crowd of summer blockbusters. By the time ep 9 gets here it most likely won't stand a chance either, no matter how well it completes the story arc and there won't be any more Star Wars films to whine about because they weren't what a few very vocal cynics would have written to please themselves. Speaking as a fan of the series who was there in 1977 to see the first Star Wars movie, I'm pretty disgusted at the negativity aimed at the series right now. It isn't justified and it may very well ruin it for the vast majority of Star Wars fans who simply enjoy the movies and are grateful that they are still around after all these years.",-0.9687,296

"This channel  is simply a bunch of shills for Hollywood. They are totally afraid to speak any real truth about crap trailers and movies. Obviously, they are afraid of ,owing their connections to Hollywood.",-0.0772,39
"This guy is not Han solo, they need to just scrap this movie. Honestly they just need to scrap Disney so all of our beloved properties can stop being mutilated by corporate agenda..",0.6249,36
This looks fabulous. Our actor looks better as Han than I thought. I‚Äôm still incredibly hyped from the last Jedi but I‚Äôm extra hyped now!,0.5334,32

"Trailer looked fine to me. Whats the big deal. ""Problem we have is Disney know how to make great trailers look at TLJ"" TLJ was a fantastic movie!",0.7959,33
Trailers with too much info is part of the problem. Why does Harloff need everything spelled out constantly? I don't want to know everything about the movie or the plot.,-0.4445,33

"Yes. We have to compartmentalize the films now. Original trilogy and rogue one films are top tier, prequels are next and then the ass cheeks edition of the new trilogy on its own.   The anthology films will likely end up in the top tier",0.4767,48

actually it is important that he does not look like Han. Feels likes fan fiction. Even if it is good. Not Han and not Star Wars.,0.8629,30

"is this gona be the first film from star wars I don't go to the cinema to see.  yes.  Sorry but I don't want a solo movie and I certainly don't want a obi one movie, loved rouge one but enough is enough lets have new stories new characters without any of it linking to old characters lets do them with different genrues too.

no overwhelming desire to see this...wanted an immediate reaction to Han..didn't get it. Not edgy enough for me...seemed a bit too nice and innocent!,0.7177,32
not a good sign when fans argue the entire time about how excited they are. lol  Different than when they really are excited and talked about the exciting scenes like with the Force Awakins. This is what happens when a studio cranks movies out this quickly and without even a script in place.,0.8173,56

"wtf? It looks terrible and to the point made about not expecting the actor to be Harrison ford like but he has to be Han Solo like and¬†he did not make me think of Han solo at all, not one frame said Han Solo to me. I honestly think they made a terrible casting choice. That kid from Baby Driver looks like a young Harrison ford. Remember Harrison was 31 years old in Star Wars, so this takes place 5 years before that? give me a break.",-0.3839,96
