"Love you Anna....but WENDY... why must you ALWAYS come across as a bitter, mean hag that loves to start evil, non-issue, stupid CRAP!  Throwing shade is talking about someone gaining weight, acting like a diva.  You brought up a moment between two FICTIONAL CHARACTERS to make it seem like Meghan is trashy in REAL LIFE!
I thought you said you were 'over' the whole royal thing, that it wasn't your cup of tea, that you weren't interested in that story, and that you were moving on...then why are you making shots like that?  It doesn't make you look like a Queen...it makes you look sad and angry.  Your total and COMPLETE dismissal of talking about Meghan PERIOD is much more powerful than low grade garbage flinging.. You KNOW this Wendy!  You are the MASTER at this game! That was a freshman move.
What has she ever done to you? Why do you hate her?  So what, she wanted to be on your show, or work for you, or whatever the heck you meant by that vague comment...AND?!? Even YOU had to start SOMEWHERE!
C'mon Wendy!  Yes, I adore you and you irk the HELL out of me at times...that means you are doing your job...and well, I might add, but that right there was trashy.
Have your peeps looks at all the crap people are slinging at the woman, yet she keeps going.  She was and will be OUR GIRL FIRST (USA)...at least you can use your platform and position of power to support Meghan, not sabotage her.",0.6536,311

Jesus LOVES  you! He is not angry at you and neither does He hate you!

The Lord came down, in the Person of Jesus Christ to die and rise again for all of us! He did this to redeem us, so that we could enter Home again, and be there eternally with Him! Hallelujah!

So friends, repent and put your faith in Jesus! Receive this Free Gift today! Call upon Him, and you will be saved!
(Romans 10:13)

The Lord will wash away your sins, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth!
He already took our punishment on the cross. He already defeated the devil! Hallelujah!
All you have to do is accept this Truth into your heart, and let it change you! 
Mustard seed faith and sincere words from your heart is what He is looking for!

Jesus will help you in whatever you are going through, because He truly, truly loves you, friends.
John 3:16 (paraphrased) says that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have life everlasting! 

Jesus also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so come to Him today! (John 6:37 paraphrased)

Shalom, my friends.",0.9876,265

Time 9:05AM Sat 2/10/18. I still don't believe Meghan applied for a job at Wendy's talk show. Don't get me wrong I love WW talk show. But to me maybe Meghan probably doe not remember meeting Wendy. Or Wendy could be making this up I don't know If she is. But who would have thought years later Meghan will soon marry the late Diana's son prince Harry.  I seen the first episode of 90210. Iam excited about this royal wedding of 2018. I have not seen a royal wedding since 2011 which was Kate & Williams wedding I only see a little bit of It.  Meghan is one lucky woman to marry a real-life prince. What Wendy did was not right at all to throw shade on Wendy. Good job Annalynn Mccord for saying mean things about Megan.,0.9307,153
