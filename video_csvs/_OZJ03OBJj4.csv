"1. If tikka knew how to speak English why did she even bother warning them in elvish 
2. Why put a CENTAUR in the movie and not mention them ever again
3.why are the orcs hated when the elvs had a leader called the dark lord shouldn't both be hated just saying this movie is ...it just fucking sucks",-0.9432,62
"1. Leilah needed and assassin to kill Tikka because she is her sister and she didn't want to have to do it herself.  2. She gave her most prized possession to kill her because Tikka had betrayed the group and was actively working against it and could endanger their mission.  3. The orcs knelt to Jakoby after he was brought back to life because being brought back to life makes him a chosen one according to prophesy.  These things were all discussed in the movie and you should already know this.  4. Why wouldn't the entire world speak Elvish since they are wealthy and powerful?  It is normal in many real life societies to have different dialects or languages among different social strata or castes.  5. Getting an Orc expert on the stand is not going to make any difference to a racially biased jury in this world any more than it would in our world.  6. No, not everyone can use a wand, but no one knows if they can until they pick one up and the lure of nearly limitless power will drive people to do really crazy and stupid things.  7. Why didn't Tikka just use the wand instead of telling Daryl to shoot?  As we see a few minutes later using the wand in such an enclosed space can cause a lot of destruction and they still needed to get Tikka to the pool to heal at this point so destroying the entire building right then would not have been helpful.  8. Also the Dark Lord was mentioned but never shown in order to setup for a sequel, which is already in the works.  There are probably more points I could make but I have only seen the movie once so far and am going just on memory of that one sitting.  I agree that more world building was needed, there were many things discussed that were never fleshed out, but it was still a pretty good movie and I look forward to the sequel.",-0.9741,365

Besides being a Nordic Combined athlete i am also a small time film maker and a love all things movie related!  Id love for CinemaSins to do an everything wrong with Eddie the Eagle and in some way be a part of it.  Besides the obvious sins that you guys would find, from the continuity errors to just bad movie making.  There are countless historical errors, and more importantly technology errors and sport inaccuracies.  SINS ON SINS!!!!

"I'm honestly sick of the ""it's not original"" excuse when nothing is really that ""original."" It's the same crap people came up with after the tide started to turn against Avatar. No one went to see Avatar because of its plot. They went to get high and see the pretty colors. At least I did. And it delivered on the pretty colors. I mean, it's like going to a typical macho-man action movie and complaining none of the characters seem very deep. Yeah.... Because it's about watching the main character kill a bunch of people in a bunch of exciting situations. If you want intellectual, you go to a film festival. Worst, despite genres like macho-man kills stuff, you never hear people complaining ""Oh, this has been done before!"" Why is it when a movie brings up ""issues"" suddenly originality becomes important? Meanwhile, it's a countdown to the next superhero movie, which is precisely the same as the last superhero movie. They just switch out the superheros. 

I don't know. I won't say this or Avatar was a great movie. But when you look at amazing shows like Game of Thrones... I honestly wish there was more fantasy on TV. Your options for fantasy is essentially GOT and Lord of the Rings. That's it! But if you like sci fi, you get a never-ending list of shows to watch. I guess my main problem with critics of this movie is that I'm a huge fan of fantasy. But if you want any fantasy, your only options are GOT, LOTR, and books. Sometimes I just want to watch something on Netflix. And every genre has more than a few bombs before it gives you any diamonds. And the smaller the genre is, the fewer diamonds. And honestly, the bombs are worth it if you are a fan of the genre and just want to turn your brain off for a bit. Again, how many bad sci fi shows are out there, and the genre just added a billion more shows tomorrow for the fans. 

I mean, with a billion some cop shows, romantic-comedy movies, sci-fi, etc. forever, it is really too much to ask for some freakin' fantasy once in a while? And with every single person going on about Shadowrun.... Man, with the never-ending tsunami of medieval stuff in fantasy... Infuriating to say the least! Any fantasy that tries to make its own world is a win for me. And I love medieval stuff for the costumes! But for all the people complaining about ""the issues,"" I'm sick of medieval misogyny in every single story. My favorite genre, and all I ever get is being smacked in the face with ""this main female character must overcome a ton of misogyny to save the world."" Would love more shows that feature original  species and original worlds. I would love for fantasy to start moving away from medieval misogyny. I would love to see a show where an original species is not an ""alien."" But a creature native to ""Earth"" (or whatever) that we have always been with. This is why sci fi ends up with so many amazing books and shows. Because they actually make original species and worlds. And again, I have to say that ""originality"" still isn't 100% original, and this never seems to be a problem until people can't deal with ""issues.""",0.9899,657
