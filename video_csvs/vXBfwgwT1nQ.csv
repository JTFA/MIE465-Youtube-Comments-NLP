"Mark Rober 

This might not necessarily be true, there's other things you should factor. There is a phenomenon with arcade switches and programming called negative edge, as negative edge describes the action of a function being activated on the release of the button instead of the press of a button. To me this anomaly sounds quite plausible as there's three actions, the compression of the button plunger, the activation of the micro switch and the release of the micro switch and plunger, and that would give you an error margin of exactly -1 or +1 light, the activation of the micro switch being 0. So the error might be in the button on the machine its self, which is technically an extension of your equipment until it presses the micro switch, not the programming of the machine ripping you off. Sometimes the plunger might be stuck making -1, sometimes it might activate on the micro switch 0 and sometimes it might activate on the release of the microswitch +1. Just my 2 cents.",-0.9445,192

"Mark Rober: I've worked arcades for over 20 years, and yes, Cyclone is set, not so much rigged or cheating. It's not much different than a slot machine. It's changed over the years that most games of ""skill"" are computer based and less chance/skill based. All the modern machines have settings so that the arcade owner can set the machine up so that X amount of money goes in before the 'chance' of winning is higher. That can be turned off, but when you work for a corporation and their main goal is making as much money as they can, then you have to use the company standard settings or risk losing your job. There's a handbook from the companies that I worked for that tell you what each prize/ticket machine is to be set to, in order for it to make maximum money, while not seeming impossible. So many times I've had to lie to people and tell them nothing is wrong with the game, when in fact if they wait until play X, they can win. Arcade games are no different. People think they really won that racing game or fighting game, when in fact there are setting for that too. During the 90's, arcade games by Midway, like Mortal Kombat and NBA Jam had setting easy, medium, hard and impossible. RAW THRILLS Shooting games have timers, that let you play X amount of time before killing you off and having you insert more money to continue. This is American games mind you. Japanese games still have you rely on skill for the most part.",0.9458,306

(JACKPOT DIFFICULTY)
To make the game easier or harder to win, this
option should be adjusted. The value displayed is
equal to how may milliseconds the “WINDOW” to
win the Jackpot is open. (A millisecond is 1/1000 of
a second.) A setting of “1” is the hardest and a
setting of “20” is the easiest. The default value for
this mode is “3”.

(JACKPOT WINABILITY) 
This mode adds a valuable feature to those
locations that have large variations in age groups.
Under the normal circumstances, the operator sets
up MODE 34 for the best payout for his location.
However this may be difficult for some age groups.
There are also circumstances where the operator
may want the jackpot to be won on an average of
XXX amount of games. This option will allow for
that. When this option is selected, no matter what
window value is chosen in MODE 34, the game will
open the window up to 20 milliseconds (easiest)
every XXX games. Every XXX games, is the
number you choose on this setting. A setting of “0”
turns this option off. The default setting for this
option is “0”.",0.9839,267
