"Jeremiah 10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.

5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.

6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.

7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.

8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.

9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.

"This man actually changed my life. Since i was a teenager i was desperately searching for the perfect man to step in my life. I dated men i knew i would never start liking (didn’t sleep with them tho just 1-2 dates) and i would ask all my friends if they knew some guys that fit me. I would annoy everyone and myself either with that stupid hunting. A few weeks ago i watched step up the very first time (yea i know lil bit late tho) and i got the hugest crush on Channing Tatum. I started loving Jenna too so basically i was obsessed with their perfect marriage and i was obsessed with that tall, strong, handsome, loving and caring father. Then i realized something. I want someone as perfect as him. And then i realized Jenna did not search for a Tatum. He just stepped in her life when she did not expect it to happen and then it just happened: the perfect man for a perfect woman. So why desperately searching for the Tatum? One day the perfect Tatum-like man will step in my life when i least expect it just like it happened with Jenna. You can’t force love. Everyone has a soulmate and if you keep jumping on everything that is good you will miss something which is perfect only because you had no patience. This is why i stopped dating and searching for the perfect man. The next time i date will make sure it’s a man who could fit my standards and not just someone who looks good but his lifestyle is completely crap or something. I will just calm down and concentrate on things that are important for my future life and that would definitely not be a man. You don’t need a man to be happy. Make yourself happy. Thanks for making me realize this Channing Tatum. Thank you very much.",0.994,358
