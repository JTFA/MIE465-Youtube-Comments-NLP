"‚ÄúThe reasons behind his apparent suicide are yet unknown.‚Äù

Honestly it‚Äôs not very unknown, the Kpop industry is extremely hard, many Kpop fans are aware of this which is why we always tell idols to eat what they want and stay healthy. Kpop fans are aware how unforgiving the industry is. Jonghyun must have been suffering for many reasons, but all mainly because of his position. I can‚Äôt even imagine the stress that comes with being an idol and producing music like he was. Kpop idols are always so hard on themselves and never think they‚Äôre good enough(hence extreme dieting). When all the stress piles up and is kept inside(which is how most idols seem to handle stress cause of the industry) is so unhealthy. He probably thought it was the only solution which makes me want to cry because we all love our biases so much and appreciate idols but they don‚Äôt appreciate themselves. I wish he could see how amazing he is and that he is worth it and not beat himself up over it. He was amazing in every way it‚Äôs the tough Kpop industry‚Äôs fault for causeing this pressure on him and making him stress over several things at once. My bias group is bts and I cant even imagine the pressure and stress they must have felt recently. Being the first Kpop group to break records and go to Billboard and AMA imagine how stressful that was. Like they were almost representing a whole genre I want to cry when I think about how idols stress out over being not good enough. I hope Jonghyun is worry free and happy somewhere where he doesn‚Äôt have to think to hard about how he looks and just enjoys himself. I hope he‚Äôs making music he loves without any pressure somewhere. Remember kpoppers, love your idols for who they are. Remind them constantly to eat healthily and never starve themselves and not to beat themselves up if they can‚Äôt get a dance right. I hope the fandoms can learn from this tragic event so it never happens again. We should all be just a bit more appreciative for how amazing they all already are and make agencies aware of that. Sleep tight fandoms, take a minute to just appreciate your favorite artists hard work. Gn
