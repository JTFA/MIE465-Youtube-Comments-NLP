"Andrew Ortiz I did submission grappling before I know how much skill it takes & how exhausting ground fighting can be. What I’m saying is the best boxers are MASTERS at what they do. Most of em been boxing since 5 competing since 8-9yrs old. Most mma guys don’t have the level of mastery in any certain discipline that a boxer does because they have so many things to focus on. And they’re not paying attention to the little things & being hard fundamentals & staying technical. Not to mention it comparison to boxers mma guys don’t have better footwork, head movement, punch variation & output, fighting angles, cutting the ring off, fighting off the back foot, inside fighting, etc and dare I say better chins. Again STAND UP fighting boxers have as legit a chance as mma guys even with kicks, knees, elbows allowed but mma guys lose in the boxing ring when it’s just hands. If a guy has better hands than you & can negate the extra limbs. Plus you can catch kicks definitely want to check them more but a boxer could time a kick & feed you a right straight down the middle that’s another thing a boxer could use to their advantage both feet are always on the ground so they stay balanced you get caught with punch with one of your legs in the air your losing position",0.6686,265

Doesn’t matter how fast the sport developed, he still beat a former 2x champ at the old age of 48. You talk about Sylvia being out of his prime. What was Mercer? At least Sylvia was 33, that’s 15 years younger and plenty of fighters have a lot left at 33. 

Funny... You make excuses for Tim Sylvia but he was younger than both Toney (42) and Mercer (48). Not to mention Tim Sylvia was in his own sport where he had been champ twice before. So if you say Sylvia was “past prime”, so was Toney and Mercer. They couldn’t even compete in their own sport at the time they went to MMA. Be consistent",0.7059,171

"Dannynorw What’s the real point? I just gave evidence to dispute your claim that “no boxers would win against any mma fighter”. Then I disputed your lies about Mercer not being 48, and your excuse that Sylvia was out of his prime.

I could care less about how boxers do in MMA. I like to watch boxers boxing at the highest level, and MMA fighters fight at the highest level. A 5 year old could figure out that somebody that only trains one discipline would get their ass beat in MMA. But if they’re a top boxer, it means nothing, they’re training to be great boxers the good ones don’t give a shit about MMA until they’re Mercer and Toneys age.

Neither combat sport is superior, it just contains athletes with more training and experience. Is MMA “superior” to BJJ, wrestling, kickboxing, boxing, Muay Thai? No, not really they’re just different variations of combat sports. I’m sure if the guys at the top at each had dedicated themselves to learning multiple disciplines they would be good. But it’s not their desire, of course if you hypothetically put them in the ring with no other training they would lose.

"Not Blake James toney was fat af & way past his prime that’s tired. Plus that fight went the way it was supposed to a decorated wrestler dared not stand with the boxer & opted to take him down. On the ground ofc boxers don’t stand a chance at grappling, but every fight starts on the feet & depending on how close two people are a boxer can get off a 1,2 quicker than an mma fighter can get a teep or roundhouse in. Within punching distance boxers would do damage. Go look at the Charlo twins they fought at 154 you know what they’d do to 155ers if they connect? A lot of boxers could fight above their weight class too a Errol Spence fights at 147 but he’d KO most if not all MMA 155ers. GGG 160 but he’d sleep 170ers & 185ers, etc. Again grappling is an automatic L for boxers but IF they can keep a fight on the feet they fare better in the cage then MMA guys do in the ring. Silva, Diaz bros, Garbrandt, Masvidal, Gustafson, etc have some of the best boxing I can remember seeing in MMA but in a boxing ring at best they’d compete at mid tier level meaning state & maybe national titles no world belts. They’d get beaten by top boxers. Oh and I like Michael Page but he’s going to get knocked the fuck out when he fights a worthy opponent.",-0.886,279

"Well ur stupid mind wouldnt comprehend it. But thats easy. First of all vasyl is way more talented and athletic than floyd is.

And his style fits mma WAY more. .he has much better footwork, he uses realistic defence for mma that also can be used with smaller gloves, he has better power and makes his opponents quit. He PRESSURES people, not just backing up using a useless boxing defence that wouldnt work in mma(that floyd uses).

"Yeah they stood by Pacquaio's side against out of prime fighters cause he was a humble good guy character that wasn't no show off including he has nothing to lose cause he already took losses. Floyd was a undefeated villain character that people wanted to see get taken down. When the young 2009 Pacquaio first fought Oscar people were scared cause they thought Pacquaio was too little for Oscar but, when Pac took over the whole fight at stoppage they felt that Pacquaio was a huge threat to Mayweather. But, fight got held back cause Pac didn't want to take a blood test. Mayweather was going to be hated for fighting out of prime fighters cause he was undefeated villain that people wanted to see him lose just one time. Guess Castillo just didn't do enough for judges but, Mayweather is at the top now and people are willing to see him get exposed no matter what. So if Terrance Crawford knocked out Mayweather or Lomachenko moved to heavyweight knocking out Mayweather it would be put in a huge Boxing docemuntary story the Floyd Mayweather that carried the whole world around all got crushed from a knock out. Floyd has everything to lose when getting beat. Holding that 0 for all these years is what makes him The Floyd Mayweather and made him different then any other fighter.",-0.9623,240

"Zybatsu I’ve pretty much followed both sports for 12 years and I’m familiar with most of the guys that crossed over. Neither boxers going to MMA or MMA fighters going to boxing have been very successful. For obvious reasons, they’re just not well rounded enough for boxers, and the MMA fighters aren’t specialized enough. Not too many have done much in either case.

“But to think Boxing takes more skill and is more real fighting than MMA is just not a statement based on reality”

I’m sorry, but did I make tha statement? No I didn’t so don’t put his sentiments with mine. They both take an immeasurable amount of skill and are both equally difficult to succeed at the highest level. What is “real fighting” doesn’t concern me I watch competitive combat sports. Today’s MMA isn’t early pride or Vale Tudo, and those were the closest to “real fighting”. But it’s just not sustainable for a entertainment sport industry. 

Oh and to dispute what you two are both saying about the Mercer fight. The gentleman’s agreement was thrown out before the fight, don’t believe me? Rewatch it and you’ll see Sylvia throw a low kick early. So he didn’t box Ray Mercer, not that it would’ve mattered.",-0.8676,266

"corey thomas You see, what they are talking is MMA. Floyd’s style just doesn’t work in MMA where there are less restrictions and more fighting styles. Vasyl has footwork rare in boxing AND MMA; his style works perfectly with it. He also has a decorated background in grappling, which floyd does not. I agree that floyd has an apparent perfect defence. You know exactly why I say apparent. He will not do as good as vasyl in mma.",0.4572,92

"jpkp012345 Why does every boxing fanboy believe it only takes ""1-2 years to train kick and grappling defense""? There are many wrestlers and grapplers in MMA that have trained damn near their whole life to take other grapplers down. Standup clinch fighting is also something you must train to avoid possible knees and openings for takedowns. 1-2 years of MMA training is not enough. James Toney was the prime example. There's a reason Holly Holm started training BJJ(She's a blue belt now).  A smart MMA fighter would know not to keep a fight standing against a boxer like Terence Crawford. Crawford would have to train in an actual grappling art extensively to make his mark. And at that point he really isn't a ""pure boxer"", but a fellow MMA fighter whose focus/specialty is on striking.",0.2942,155
"jpkp012345 huge what if for all we know the amatuer mma fighter could land a head kick and ko's him or picks him apart with leg kicks, and you're very ignorant if you think learning grappling for 1-2 years is enough what this tells me is you've never trained in grappling at all, also really he can sleep every 145-170 pounder in UFC if the fight remains standing I'm not doubting he could ko a fighter but an extremely ridiculous and ignorant claim you act like no mma fighter has any talent on the feet some of these guys have trained muai Thai for most of there lives and some even have legit kickboxing resumes the only thing you managed to do is make what if scenarios and a few ridiculous claims and read my last comment on Floyd striking in a mma fight",-0.8199,147
