Black Panther is an incredible movie and a juggernaut at the box office so not surprised it held in it's second week.  But you have to give it to Marvel/Disney for placement.  It's up against nothing right now.  It has no real competition at all.  I think they have everyone else scared stiff to release a major movie anytime close to when Disney drop a Marvel or Star Wars film now.  Usually a movie such as this at the moment is usually guaranteed at least two weeks with nothing to cut into it's profit and that's where Disney are making all their money.  They probably don't really care about week three drop off (although I'd be shocked if it wasn't still number one next week).,-0.8933,136
"Black Panther is middle tier MCU for me. The more I dissect it, the more it drops a little bit. 
It's very similar to the first Thor, but not as good. Wakanda is very much another world like Asgard, and it deals with Kings and Princes and battling for the throne, but Loki is more developed and present in the movie than Killmonger, and there's no meandering plot with useless missions to catch some random bad guy in Thor. And the final sequence is more impactful in Thor since the characters have a history with each other. Whereas Killmonger is a guy who just shows up and everyone just bows to him conveniently.
Killmonger should have made it to Wakanda MUCH earlier, and he should have interacted more with the main characters. The whole thing with selling Vibranium and trying to catch Klaw was completely unnecessary.",-0.9295,160

He can gleam Joy out of sorrow, Peace out of adversity. Only a Friend who is the King of Kings could accomplish this divine alchemy.

The friendship He offers you is practical and down--to--earth, yet it is saturated with heavenly Glory. Living in the presence of Jesus the Christ means living in two realms simultaneously: the visible world and unseen, eternal reality. Jesus has equipped you to stay conscious of Him while walking along dusty, earthbound paths. Jesus Christ is patiently waiting with loving open arms for you to accept Him and give you life to Him. Accept His free gift of Salvation RIGHT NOW!  Repent and turn away from a life of sin and turn to Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

T‚ÄôChalla was on a straight forward mission: find the man who blow up the UN netting, therefore killing his father (T‚ÄôChaka). I feel like in BP he didn‚Äôt have this straight forward mission, giving that seem of disconnect, you could say.

The timeline seems to be slightly messy as well. Because (as you said) ‚ÄúT‚ÄôChaka has already established that Wakanda was going to... start reaching out to the world in Civil War‚Äù then in the end scene T‚ÄôChalla announced this again. I suppose this end scene could‚Äôve to confirm this, bc of the events in Civil War.

But they had to ignore that in order to play up the ""sins of the fathers"" element, and they painted T'Chaka -- even the spirit of T'Chaka -- as a hardcore nationalist, and that T'Challa was going to right the ship... even though T'Chaka was the one to start righting the ship.

If it drops big over the next few weeks in the US, it should still make at least $150m more.  I'm assuming it will at least cross the $600m domestic mark though.

They shout online how great their films are but certainly aren't showing up to theaters. Wonder Woman was okay; entertaining scenes but not at all memorable as far as film is concerned.

DC have a plethora of other, more qualified women they can get to help make Batgirl.  Gail Simone has tweeted a bunch of times that she'd love to do it. She'd be an amazing choice imo. She has experience writing Batgirl and tonnes of other properties in the DC universe, she's even written episodes of DC animated series like JLU and BATB.

"Wow a Star Wars book fan wants the book writers to write the movies, nothing new here. Claudia Grey knows SW better than Rian Johnson? What the hell does that prove? He's still a far better storyteller. I just read a couple of her books, and while they were well-written the stories were not particularly inventive or original. What made TLJ great was not how much nerd stuff it got right or how many characters were connected to other characters we knew, but how it was Johnson's interpretation of Star Wars. It was a highly personal film for him, and before anyone says ""It should be SW, like it always has been"", get used to it. We're in the era where we're getting at least one a year, I'd rather they be passion projects rather than navel-gazing factory flicks.
Same goes for DC. Patty Jenkins is no comic writer, just a talented artist near the top of her field who was given an opportunity to do her thing, her interpretation of WW. And Coogler & his co-writer (to some extent) with BP.",0.9431,206

So I say give these up-n-coming female or black or hispanic Directors a shot, white dudes have had their opportunity for the past 80 years or so, and there will always be more work for them.

"yea i just found out about that, happy kevin¬¥s alive too :).

the view report. everything but theatre movies counts views.... weird. blah! with the money, it¬¥s not exciting....
ticket prices could be a factor also as to how much more movies bring in nowadays. fewer moviegoers but more expensive?
in general, sometimes you get a lot of people out despite the prices. 

territories perri?.. yes it¬¥s a bit of a shame annihilation¬¥s not gonna be in theaters apart from in the states.
maby oscars matters more to them than viewers. nothing¬¥s a territory of the states other than alaska and embassies i guess.
perhaps parts of wherever you¬¥re causing a ruckus presently... yes schnepp starve yourselves to watch movies, good idea...
f#¬§% safe endings :), fire those producers. probably the bastards that pulled it from theaters. you¬¥re fired....

dc could just shut down their movie division and give the arrow verse all the characters.

i¬¥d love hamill in guardians 3 :).

star wars needs to get a grip on canon 1st...

budgets could go down. lower but stable wages with potential million dollar bonuses if they feel like they need that...
less marketing. f#¬§% these million dollar wages up front before the thing¬¥s even made...

5 mill for 5 scripts and you¬¥re just using 1¬¥s wastefull to. just do 1 for 1, preferably less than 1 mill.
how about 1 month pay? and a bonus after the fact. if it takes more than a month to write then you¬¥d get a bit more.
all extra costs goes out over moviegoers right? lower budgets lower ticket prices right? more moviegoers?

i don¬¥t belive that joss didn¬¥t have ideas for batgirl either. who looks bad here? wb/dc right? joss would¬¥ve made a great batgirl
though after everything perhaps he wasn¬¥t doing it at all... wb/dc just won¬¥t stop misleading everyone.

still think disney can do all the books, comics and games to live action streaming movies,sreies and mini series.

the beach is ok.

not sure yardie¬¥s my kind of theatre movie.

i want ben to be batman :), i want others to never work again. i put that mess on wb/dc.
did wb/dc try to make joss look bad? it¬¥d be nice with joss to star wars, firefly or 
to something new in the mcu :).
