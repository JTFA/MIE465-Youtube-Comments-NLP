Don't believe what NASA tells you or any other agency, research it, and then believe it ! Because after 10, 15 years NASA is going to tell you - we just send the first humans to Mars and they are starting the new human colony there lmao, and you gonna be watching this in front of your little computer screens and believe it, when this is going to be just another VR crap ! Research ""Flat Earth"", don't dismiss it ! And most importantly think with your brain what is rational and makes sense ! For example according to NASA as I am writing this - the Earth is spinnig around it's axis with 1000 mph, while orbiting the sun with 66 000 mph, and at the same time the Earth with the sun are both racing around the Milky Way galaxy with 483 000 mph, while the whole Milky Way galaxy is flying through space with 1 300 000 mph and all the other galaxies are flying away from each other with who knows how many millions and billions mph...or you are just walking on a stationary flat plane ! What makes more sense to you ? I guess walking on a flat stationary surface sounds way more outrageous than flying through space on a ball  with millions mph in 10 different directions.
