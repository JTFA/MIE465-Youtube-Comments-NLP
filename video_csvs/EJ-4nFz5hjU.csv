And I really wish my mom were here right now and in the future. Because I'd want to sit down with both of them one day like this and just talk and bond.
I'm glad you have your mom for support. Sadly I don't have mine though, She died last year and I haven't seen my dad in 10 years. I almost don't want to see him either.. But idk. Maybe one day I'll be as mature as you and I'll be able to talk to him. 
Because, Shane, this takes so much courage. And I know you'll probably not read this but you're incredible. You're so amazing and funny and brave and you're honestly my hero. Thank you for making these videos about your past, I know it's hard to talk about but thank you so so much.",0.9894,223
