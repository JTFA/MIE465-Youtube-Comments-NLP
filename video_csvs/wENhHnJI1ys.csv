"Hey ! great job doing this map (and all the others), I'll just make two minor corrections/additions : 
- pharmacology doesn't just study how drugs have effects in the body but how every chemical (including nutrients like sugar, proteins or potassium for instance or even poisons like lead or arsenic) affects the body :) 
- You could've included epigenetics which studies the modifications in the genome without modification of the DNA sequences and how it affects genetic expression, it's a major study field in genetics !",0.8217,95

I LOVE watching your videos! can you make a map of psychology as well?? it would be a great help!,0.9411,24
"I believed there are number of corrections that need to be done on the map and explanation. First Biology has two main pillars that you need to emphasize clearly: The theory of evolution and the central dogma of the molecular biology. The first pillar is important since ""Nothing in Biology makes sense in the light of evolution"". The main ingredient of life diversity is natural selection through evolution, and systematics is the discipline in charge to study the biodiversity and how distant they are,, which means how far or close are related two groups of organisms. Currently there is an entire debate about what is the best approach to do so and to draw the three of life, which ""Evolutionary biology"" works so intense. One approach relies on the molecular fingerprint of all organisms, our DNA. The central Dogma of molecular biology tells us that DNA contains the information of all the organisms, which is transmited via transcription to the ribosomes and translated to produce proteins. Proteins are studied by biochemistry to understand the underlying chemical complexity  and the interaction with the other biomolecules of life: lipids and carbs. Molecular biology has also discovered that this central dogma can be violated, when RNA is catalytic (just like enzymes) as it occurs in some microorganism such as bacteria, studied by microbiology, or when proteins can also behave as information carriers as prions, which can induce conformational changes in the structure of proteins, which is studied by structural biology, a branch of biophysics which offers a span of methodology to study life and also create other cross-disciplinary fields such as biomechanics and quantum biology. The molecular level can be scalated to the cellular level, where we can find all the processes that allows cells to work: respiration, homeostasis, glucolisis, and of course celular division. This is the foundation of other disciplines such as physiology in charge to understand how different organs, composed of different cells, orchestrate the homeostasis of multicelular organisms. Anatomy is well explained, and then I would suggest to explain the ""individual level"" studied by ecology in charge to understand the complexity of organisms with their enviroment going from species, populations, comunities, ecosystems and the biosphere. Populations is the subject of genetics in charge to understand the heritage laws and the dynamic flow inside populations.  The analysis of many genotypes inside of populations is sometimes difficult and require the power of computers, algorytms and mathematics. Bioinformatics helps us to understand the structure of genomes of different species, and how we can use mathematics to suggest models of genotypic expression. This is applied in systems biology, biotechnology and other fields suchs epidemiology as you explained. Last but not least, bioethology is important for ecology, since it tries to understand the behaivour of organisms. I do not want to brag about but I believe as a biologist if I want to see my own field in a map, it should be like above, but of course I am also subjected to corrections from my colleagues. Anyway, good job nobody actually really cares to do it , and it is a huge task what you are trying to do.",0.9714,586

"“The Overriding Supremacy of the Myth”
  In recent years some scientists have raised serious doubts about the viability of the theory of evolution as expressed by Charles Darwin. This is especially true of molecular biologists.
  In his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, Michael Denton, a researcher in biology, wrote: “The raising of the status of Darwinian theory to a self-evident axiom has had the consequence that the very real problems and objections with which Darwin so painfully laboured in the Origin have become entirely invisible. Crucial problems such as the absence of connecting links or the difficulty of envisaging intermediate forms are virtually never discussed and the creation of even the most complex of adaptations is put down to natural selection without a ripple of doubt.”
  He continues: “The overriding supremacy of the myth has created a widespread illusion that the theory of evolution was all but proved one hundred years ago . . . Nothing could be further from the truth.”—Page 77.
  “If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.”—Origin of Species, Charles Darwin, page 154.
  “As the number of unexplained, irreducibly complex biological systems increases, our confidence that Darwin’s criterion of failure has been met skyrockets toward the maximum that science allows.” (Darwin’s Black Box—The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, Michael J. Behe, pages 39-40) In other words, recent findings in the field of molecular biology raise serious doubts about Darwin’s theory.
  “The result of [the] cumulative efforts to investigate the cell—to investigate life at the molecular level—is a loud, clear, piercing cry of ‘design!’ The result is so unambiguous and so significant that it must be ranked as one of the greatest achievements in the history of science. The discovery rivals those of Newton and Einstein, Lavoisier and Schrödinger, Pasteur, and Darwin. The observation of the intelligent design of life is as momentous as the observation that the earth goes around the sun.”—Darwin’s Black Box, pages 232-3.",0.8433,414
