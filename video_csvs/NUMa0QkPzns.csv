"A tip for those using greyscale on iphone: you can set the accessibility shortcut to disable or enable it by pressing home 3 times. 

I never used greyscale because I sometimes need colours for work. But now I have it on, because I can quickly disable it for when it's needed, then re-enable. 

Greyscale: settings --> general --> accessibility --> display accomodations  --> color filters --> grey scale

Triple click: accessibility --> scroll to bottom --> accessibility shortcut --> select color filters

If you find yourself disabling too much you could set a daily reminder to check if it's enabled. For me, this let me actually use greyscale! Very happy.",0.3367,122

"I just want to say ""addiction"" is by definition a behavior which you do repeatedly to get some psychological or physical reward but hurting yourself at the same time.  Heroine is addictive because it incapacitates you, makes you not think about anything else, injures your body over time.  Looking at your phone is not addiction, unless your baby is dying next to you or you can't properly hold a job down because you are too busy playing bejeweled.  I'm concerned we throw this word around too much.

Having said that People not thinking about their lives and goals is a problem we've had for centuries even before electricity.  Companies taking advantage of people to distract them into interacting with their apps and taking their focus away from other things is a problem.  But it's not addiction.  We have an opioid problem in the country right now and that's real addiction.

Facebook is taking advantage of you, keep that in mind, but Facebook doesn't have a key to ""addiction"" worked out to a formula.  It's a tool and it depends on how you use it.  But this isn't a drug designed to get you to stay on your couch for 24 hours a day.  People said the same thing about Radio, movies, TV, computers, and now phones.  Society is going to go on.

Language is important because i wouldn't talk to an ""Design Specialist"" to talk about Addiction.  Designers know how to capture your attention and how to work against tricks designed to capture your attention, but they don't deal with true ""addiction.""",-0.7002,295

"This video is great. I especially enjoyed the hint to somehow make your feeds update about 3 times a day or less. I've been thinking about similar stuff myself recently - why would I need to know all news right now and how is that different from learning all the news once a day? I found out for myself that there is no difference. Two months ago I started spending a bit less time online due to home maintenance stuff I help with, and I found out that there is no difference if I check feeds all the time or once in a day or two. I stay informed and up to date anyway. I also guess that subscribing to only essential sources, like 1 to 4 news sources, 2-3 sources for your hobbies, 2-3 sources for your trade/profession is more than enough to keep you up to date on everything. Think about it.

Once I started be online less I discovered that most things I cared for online dont matter

As for notifications, strangely, but I always felt irritated, not engaged, by most of them. I only use vk for social networking and I have deleted their app long ago due to low space, I get there via browser and so I practically get no notifications from apps (and none from browser) except google's account warnings. These warnings are not automatically purged, they annoy you each time you boot and so I've been looking recently to disable them. What a coincidence lol. But for those using apps I also recommend deleting apps and check your sources in browser. You'll see, when you dont enable browser notifications, then web will be less addicting than apps for you.

Just trying to share what I found out for myself and be helpful.

It's not the first time I see such anti-social networking news and videos lately. I guess we (humanity) are on the edge of some consumer revolution, that will render social feeds and constant online engagement obsolete very soon. How - we'll wait and see.",-0.1251,381

"well, i kinda ""hack"" my phone so unless i'm really bored, i'll not check the damn phone.
1. i have 1 phone and 1 tablet, i'm only fill data plan on my phone, the tablet only can connect via hotspot tether from my phone, all thing that's constantly updated the content (like chatting, social media app), either installed on my tablet or uninstall it (if i already have no purpose having that); in this way, i'm too lazy to checking my gadget frequently, because my phone have no content that's updated frequently and my tablet isn't easy to use, because i need to turn on hotspot, etc.
2. but there's still browser in phone that's can access frequently updated content; well, i'm just use harsh way by unfollow all pages, people and group that's frequently updated unnecessary content that's i like, so i spend less on social media because there's no ""new"" content like every second and i'm got bored.
3. how about game in phone?, i'm only install casual games that's not really easy to accessed (because not 1 tap play like most of offline game), neither takes long time to complete a game; in short some online game that's doesn't need long time to complete a game (like uno) because online game need to find other player to play, so it's not easy to accessed and it's not use much time, because 1 game is just like 3 minute, and good thing, because the game kinda repetitive, i never spend so much time play that.",-0.8084,300
