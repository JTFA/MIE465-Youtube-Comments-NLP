"Angry Alan Rants In this century, change is happening. How many movies did they make already? Donâ€™t you think eventually with all the movements that thereâ€™ll be a change in cast? I get what you are saying, but this could be the movie that changes something. Already you guys canâ€™t see pass his skin color. Also, saying the character isnâ€™t allowed to black or supposed to be black is like saying that the play Alexander Hamilton shouldnâ€™t use black actors to play people who were white.  Not to sound like the typical person, but thatâ€™s just prompting separation.",0.8823,121

He is just trying to see pc no one really wants 5o see any bond movies anymore let alone a woman cuz James Bond was a womanizer so is the female one going to fuck dudes up then go fuck a dude she just met  then go fuck some spy dude who then fallow her around the rest the movie like the females do in the male Version an a black one there's really no point to it but it's more believable an if you do make a black one he should play it cuz he's English an a action star but don't reboot an old James Bond make him the new an improved bond,0.1406,115
I don't give a shit what the world is ready for that has zero to do with anything. James Bond is a white British man and that's the way it is.,0.6623,33
I think the world is ready for a transsexual Muslim Republican but that don't mean I think he should be James Bond nor a Chinese woman should play Black Panther. If you want Black characters then create new Black  Characters.,0.7876,42
I want to see an attack helicopter bond.,-0.4215,9
"I would love to see Elba in that role.  However, casting a woman as James Bond does not make sense since the character is simply not a woman.  Additionally, somebody can go and write a Bond-esque character who happens to be a female.  Atomic Blonde is a good example.  I only feel that making creative decisions based on politics is where things go wrong, and by that, an agenda becomes the focus and no longer what should beâ€”the story.",0.6908,90
I'm actually not interested in James Bond at all. The movies are kind of boring and repetitive. A new take could be interesting.,-0.4855,26
I'm all for equality but one thing is sure i will never watch a female Bond,0.4497,16
"I'm gonna agree with ya, been preaching that my damn self. Eon Productions is a family run business who owns the Bond IP essentially, they've produced Bond pictures since the 60's. The character is an iconic one with tradition and history that so happens to be white, just like Superman, Batman, etc. I don't want to see a male Wonder Woman, three dudes playing Charles's Angles, or a white Black Panther. You see what happened when they made The Ancient One (Doctor Strange) a white female (Tilda Swinton)... Let's just make new characters and new material... Cause switching a white Bond with a black Bond doesn't feel progressive, it feels forced. Barbara Broccoli (Eon Producer) said she'd go for a female director which would be cool. Let's rock with that. PS... I'm a black guy....",0.291,162

But 007 is not a black guy itâ€™s not a woman. Thatâ€™s like saying Blade should be a white guy!  Or shaft should be a white woman.   Or storm should be a white male.
