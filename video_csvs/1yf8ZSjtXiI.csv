+Fickleheaded Yup! I've got a library of videos I have been stacking over a period of time. Will be putting out a bunch of videos in the near future hopeully.,0.0,34
"+Geo C Yeah this video is pretty much a stress test for YT compression. So much variety in texture, with heavy amounts of chromatic aberation, and very little gradient between the shadow and light. Haha My original 1080p screen shot for the thumbnail was actually too big for YouTube in it's lightest compression because of the extreme amounts of texture variation so I had to basically select a different section of the video to screen shot and add a lot more contrast beween the light and dark regions to reduce the amoubt of detail being rendered. It was a challenge finding the right balance between quality for the thumbnail and hitting the right filensize.",0.802,121

"+unalx Good thought! However we know it isn't a boundary effect because we can see the impact spread fully isolated from the edges of our screens. The effect also starts the same way no matter where we hit the screen. Each of those shots was impacting a whole different part of the screen, but cut together for continuity. Plus the star shaped shockwave's diagonal corners are essentially rounded off in a logorithmic curve that becomes more dramatic the further it deviates from the vertical and horizontal elements of the mesh pattern. It is all very different behavior than for instance the ripple in a square bucket of water when you drop a pebble into it.

There are a lot of tell tale signs that the effect is caused by the mesh rather than the frame.",-0.7174,144

Did you delete my comment about video pixelating due to compression? Pretty weird that you will decide to delete comment which basically explains why video pixelates right when slow mo starts.,0.3612,33

"I would be really interested to see the pattern if the screen was installed at a 45 degree angle to the frame, instead of a [near] perfect 90.  I also believe that the pattern would differ, slightly, when using a square frame vs a rectangular frame.  Both would be great follow-ups to further examine the results.  Another test would be to pull the screen tight in a more diamond-shape over a square frame, rather then keeping the mesh perfectly square.  This would likely differ greatly between a square and rectangular frame, as opposed to the square mesh, which would be a more subtle difference, if any.",0.9432,120

"Not so sure about the explanation, they should do the same experiment with a circular frame for the net, to make sure it's not a boundary effect.",0.6353,30
