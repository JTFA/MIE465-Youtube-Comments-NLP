There are two real issues, 1. Contempt of public proceedings and 2. How much the teachers are paid and why.

1. This public proceeding is similar to the court‚Äôs system where if you are told to be quiet by the judge and you don‚Äôt listen, then the judge puts you in CONTEMPT has an officer escort you to jail until you make bail or until you see a judge. I wouldn‚Äôt want this teacher teaching my kid, she doesn‚Äôt know how her own school processes work and after being told to ‚Äústop‚Äù a number of times, she persists. If you don‚Äôt listen to the officer right or wrong, that‚Äôs resisting arrest. Because Obama didn‚Äôt enforce the law, everyone thinks they can just say anything they want when they want, which isn‚Äôt the case. There is a procedure that must be followed. The same with these people that disrupt Congress, technically they are in contempt and should be taken away to jail. 

2. The way my school district works is the people living in the district vote to elect the School Board officials. The School Board then decides how much the people that work for them, like the superindent, get paid. In this case it‚Äôs a contract between the School Board and their employee, the superindent. 

The School‚Äôs budget is usually a yes or no vote, voted on by the people living in the school district, prior to the school year. That budget after working with the Teacher‚Äôs Union is proposed by the Superindent and the School Board. If the budget isn‚Äôt approved, the School board along with their employees like the superindent go back and propose a new budget. Then that new budget goes up for a vote until it passes. 

In that budget there is a total number for teacher‚Äôs salaries. It‚Äôs not what each individual teacher is paid, that‚Äôs decided by their union contract. School Board approves all teacher pay (a lump sum) for that school year, the School Board and the superindent have nothing to do with the individual teacher salaries. That‚Äôs the union. 

Public school teacher‚Äôs individual salary IS NOT decided by the School Board or is voted on by the people. Those salaries are bargained for by their union in their individual union contracts. The Union represents the teachers against the School Board. 

Public unions contracts DO NOT reward the best workers and they certainly do not reflect what the people voted for.  

To me the Teacher‚Äôs Union is the issue, these teachers are upset with.

My solution is school choice. You take the taxes allocated to the school district and divide that by the number of both private and public students in the school district. That‚Äôs the voucher number for each student. Each school gets funding based on the number of children and then they have to make up a budget. 

It‚Äôs how universities decide on what to allocate money to. If school can‚Äôt get students to come to their school, the school goes bankrupt. To me that‚Äôs the fairest way to do. Then each parent basically votes with which school they let their child attend. 

The reason the unions do not want this (See Detroit as to what happens when the public union workers are paid unsustainable wage-pensions are decreased and jobs are lost) is that there would be no union and each individual teacher would be paid on what they are worth. 

Bottom-line it is NOT the teachers that decide the budget it is the democratically elected school board that does. We live in a democratic Republic and that‚Äôs what the School board elected officials reflect. 

These are teachers. Not everyone can talk at once or talk over people and that‚Äôs what the teachers do.",-0.4995,794
