Good video but everyone (in Britain at least) who loves Rowan Atkinson knows that truly his greatest comic creation was Blackadder.

"Hey Nerdwriter1, can you do a video on how Stewart Lee writes a joke? He is possibly the most original stand-up comedian alive today with a style all his own. He often de-constructs a joke whilst telling it, even alluding to exactly how the audience might react or begrudging them when they laugh at parts he believes to be poor. Think Pen & Tellers Ball & Cup routine. To really admire Stewart Lee it is best to follow his stand-up from the start and understand how his routines evolved in complexity. I recommend his shows 'Stand Up Comedian', '41st Best Stand Up Ever', 'If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One', and 'Carpet Remnant World', in that order. His BBC TV show 'Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle' is also good and has some complex routines such has is Paul Nuttall/Beaker People routine where he takes a premise and repeats it to its logical and absurd conclusion. A lot of clips are here on YouTube but the shows really work best as a whole.

Now with that said and the fact that my Goofy wake and bake videos and Golden Era throwback 1990s hip-hop tracks do not compare at all to your videos, I was originally (after reading the title of this particular latest video) going to leave a very smart ass comment about how even though your videos are great they're starting to become very Captain Obvious. Meaning and (I'm sure you can figure this out) that if you just take your videos at face value look at the thumbnail and read the title A guy like me considers myself to be well-read and of the type that would make videos like yours would think like ""no duh"", like Norm Macdonald is the greatest comedian or Alfred Hitchcock master of suspense you know Steely Dan writes a good song LOL I'm paraphrasing now but you understand the point ,so then of course I'm smart enough to watch the video before I leave the comment. I have to say this is probably one of the best f****** videos on physical comedy and just comedy in General I've ever seen in my life I'm not even that big of a Rowan Atkins fan I've only seen a couple mr-bean things my biggest exposure to him is his role in Rat Race. this video not only taught me some stuff but it was extremely funny while you were trying to point out what was funny about it.

"What you bring up about Rowans acting style, how he himself talks about how the awkward or even insane qualities are just acted out visually, how there's a truth to it is exactly what I had been thinking when I watched Watemote.

Its an anime, yes (And just for the record the subbed version conveys tone better than the dubbing does). But the main premise is around the main characters perspective. She's antisocial, but has a wild and isolated view of the people around her. The show often animating her mental fits of outrage, fear, anxiety or spite as it appears in her mind. You might be talking to a person whom you hate greatly, but you don't show that to them. Instead you rant in the back of your mind. In Watemote's case that back of the mind ranting becomes a distraction for her, and instead of being JUST a narration is fully animated out from houses burning down or other characters being grossly exaggerated in the aspects she hates, even the ones in her self.

The visuals would other wise paint her as a lunatic, but in the end she's still a shy and antisocial character struggling with her own demons. The aspect that takes over her outward character, even if she hates her self inside. If we had most of our thoughts and feelings  in reality animated out over our heads for us to see our selves, we would probably look and sound like crazy people out in the open. Buut. No matter how extreme or weird it seems, it is somewhat true. Its relatable. As Rowan mentions.
