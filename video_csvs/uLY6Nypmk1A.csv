It’s funny how dumb black bitches will defend KIm K for the same things they denigrate K Michelle for. I’m starting to realize that black women hate each other.

"We could’ve had a global revolution if mf would let black women say how they fukin feel. Don’t stop her. Don’t slow her down. Don’t stop her shine The industry ain’t been fuckin with K since day one But turn around an make Cardi B #1 The industry got being a hoe trending. Chose wisely industry heads you got rebellion giving you an ear full but won’t get behind her because she’s too rebellious like fr fr dead ass “kiss my ass” rebellious. This is why shit never get off the ground and never take flight because mf that ain’t visionary always trying to steer the wind. Let her say what’s on her mind and blatantly stop disregarding the emotions of the millions of her fans that relate to her. Mfs need to stop making black women bite their tongues and shhh them put other race of women on pedestal put black women down and drag them them then turn around and promote pure whore-ism booty shots and sponsor pussy. It’s clearly a mans world and if shit ain’t looking right for example, Our currently 1st lady, (no offense and all) then line up men and take blame. They won’t though. They place blame on the female counterpart because looking in the mirror is to damn hard to do these days. smdh",-0.9875,264

"this is great!! but just a question...Kim is mostly white but also Armenian, right? so, how does that work in terms of cultural appropriation? like, obviously she's not black, and thus she is wrongfully appropriating Black culture in unoriginal, knockoff ways, and getting praised for it while Black women are shamed and marginalized.

BUT i'm interested in the idea of how sometimes white or mostly-white people aren't white-passing. for example, my friend is full first-generation Italian and looks to be of some kind of middle-Eastern descent. he had an issue w/TSA that was probably assumed-race-based once, and people always assume he's not white. (which isn't bad obviously, just interesting.)

so basically i'm just curious if anyone has thoughts on if white privilege still applies to non-white-passing white people. (sorry if any of this comes across as super ignorant, i just was interested and couldn't find anything about the topic online)",0.9851,178
