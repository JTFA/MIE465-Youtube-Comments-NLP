"A true Heisman would have done what he did on the field, and left it as that. Not do the filth he did in front of women and children that watch. If you condone it, you are part of the problem. Seems like most of your fan base is just as trashy. Hope he plays Clemson so we can crush hid dreams again.",0.8591,70
"Anna Kat - Saban is a whiny little bitch who failed miserably as an NFL coach. That's the only reason he's at Alabama - so he can be a control freak over college kids. When he got in the NFL players faces, they would tell him to go f**k himself. He couldn't handle it so he quit and walked away with his tail between his legs.",-0.9108,74

"I would have dropped the f-bomb on the Kansas players as soon as they didn't shake my hand. Respect goes both ways, don't disrespect someone and wonder why your getting cussed out. Baker, didn't do anything wrong as far as the Kansas team went, they are trash. He went wrong by putting his school, coach and team mates in a bad light. So lets forgive, forget and go win a Championship.",0.8967,81

Johnny Clemson - You're calling Mayfield a closet queer? Just because he lets you suck his dick doesn't make him a queer....it's just that you are really good at what you do best. #johnnyclemsonswallows,0.2944,38
Johnny Clemson - You're clearly struggling for a decent comeback and with life in general. It's not your fault though; your parents are actually full blood brother and sister so there's no way you could not be severely retarded. Just stop sucking Mayfield's dick and licking his ass until the Championship game is over. It's distracting him. You can resume once he's drafted to the NFL.,-0.484,72
"Johnny Clemson -That's your best comeback? Pitiful, just downright pitiful. Ease up on Mayfield, the poor guy can't even take a good dump because your tongue is always in his asshole. There are plenty of other guys in need of your outstanding tongue and deep throat skills. #johnnysucksandtonguesreallygood",-0.4226,55

People react different ways. Can't change that but I wouldn't curse them out and do the other gestures because I didn't get a hand shake. I would just laugh and say oh well loser. You got a future career in the NFL. You don't want your stock to drop because of silly antics,0.302,57

"Somebody told those little kids not to shake Bakers hand. What kind of example is that to set for those little ones? Dirty hits (one player should have been ejected) and trash talk on Baker all night. Baker lost his composure and was wrong. I repeat...he was wrong; however, he isnâ€™t the first to get caught on camera or a hot microphone. He owned it and apologized. 
Its okay Kansas. Iâ€™m sure all players on your team get a participation trophy. Whoâ€™s ever heard of OU offerings a scholarship to an athlete that would rather go to Kansas and play football? Kansas Football, the road to the NFL (meaning not for long) period. They used to get my sympathy vote, but they wonâ€™t anymore. Go K State!",0.392,157

"this faker said and did, and those ou fans taking a stand to give his antics a free pass clearly show how low this faker and those ou fans can go and he and all of those pity ou fans don't deserve any respect. ku players were right not shaking hands with this faker bum. who knew what he grabbed with that dirt hand before then.
even without justified points, to decide not to shake hands is civilised way to demonstrate disrespect to say the most and could be the best way for 'greeting' those well 'deserved' object, but grabbing your junk publicly and shouting swear words is nothing but showing low, slow and uncivilised, as well as really stupid.
oklahoma university should open some classes to civilise this faker guy and those thug fans.",-0.7029,149
