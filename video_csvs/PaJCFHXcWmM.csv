"Los conciertos de U2 en Barcelona han sido considerados uno de los acontecimientos musicales más destacados de este año en nuestro país, pero es verdad que un nuevo disco de la banda irlandesa ya no es un hecho trascendental, como podía ocurrir hace una década. El lanzamiento de un álbum de la banda de Bono ya no es un fenómeno mundial de masas, las cosas han cambiado. No se trata de que éste sea su decimocuarto trabajo y que haya cansancio, la cosa es que la industria musical ha cambiado, el consumo y el mercado está abarrotado de permanentes novedades. U2 tampoco son ya los mesiánicos personajes que fueron tiempo atrás. ""Song of experience"" es una colección de 13 canciones que mantiene los clichés del grupo hasta el punto que se convierte en una continuación de ""Songs of innocence"", de 2014, con textos de denuncia y ritmos similares, de baja intensidad. La América de Trump, el drama de los refugiados, la muerte... se convierten en las preocupaciones de sus letras, con referencias continuas a La Biblia, incluidas al Evangelio según San Mateo (“bienaventurados los arrogantes (…) los pobres (…) y los ricos” es su versión).
La grabación ha sido extenuante, casi interminable, se han utilizado numerosos estudios: los Electric Lady Studios y Pull Studios de Nueva York, The Church y Assault and Battery de Londres, el Shangri-La y The Woodshed de Los Ángeles, el Strahmore House de Dublín y un estudio móvil en Vancouver. Cómo negarle tantos placeres a Bono, un maniático de los sonidos, que ha llegado a utilizar a nueve productores y quince ingenieros que participaron en la grabación. Como resultado un sonido sin sorpresas, tópico, bajo la perspectiva de lo previsible, sin riesgos como prueban ""Love is all we have left"", ""Lights of home"", ""American soul"", ""Summer of love·"", ""Landlaly"" o ""Red flag day"" que al menos anima con esos riffs, pero en el fondo tantas manos han dejado el producto sin sustancia, con sabor a pastiche o bollería industrial.
