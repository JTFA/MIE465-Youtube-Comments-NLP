"Hiccup cure - hold your breath, but you have to do it for 30 seconds (or until you have a strong urge to breathe again, basically). Hiccups are basically a leftover reflex from in the womb, exercising the diaphragm without aspirating amniotic fluid. When you hold your breath, I'm told, the CO2 build-up in your blood tells the vegus nerve to stop the hiccups so you can breathe.",0.3919,78
