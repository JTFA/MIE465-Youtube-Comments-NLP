And they're changing the dynamic similar to voltron with switching around the lions and the pilot a a bit since the original. As for the art work I wanna wait till I see it in motion cause that is what counts. We won't really get a feel until the first episode for motion and writing. Nothing is sacred.

Of course the new generation loves and enjoy cgi cartoons, but as an artist myself, and because ive grown with them, i will always prefer hand drawn over cgi cartoons
Ive experienced them all my life and like many other people, i still LOVE to watch them, and because i draw and will continue to draw until the day that i die...hand drawn cartoons will always be a million times better than any cgi cartoons in the world, im really sad to see them disappear, thats something that really gets to me
