"Intro: Chloe]
Beautiful people of the world
Halle's fake sleepin'
Can you tell?
We have a new song out!

[Chorus]
Watch out, world, I'm grown now
It's about to go down
My heart beatin' so loud
Mama, look, I'm grown now
(I'm grown!)

[Verse 1: Halle]
I can't sleep, I'm wide awake (Wake)
I've been up since yesterday (Day)
Scared 'cause I know it ain't a game ('Ame)
Like, who am I gonna be today? (Day)
Tell your homeboy what's good ('s Good)
I'm tryna fit in your hood (Hood)

[Pre-Chorus: Halle]
Got the weight of the world on me (Me)
But no regrets, this is what I say (Ay)

[Chorus]
Watch out, world, I'm grown now
It's about to go down
My heart beatin' so loud
Mama, look, I'm grown now
(I'm grown!)
 

[Verse 2: Chloe]
Learn something new everyday (Day)
I don't know so imma feel my way (Way)
I'm taking one day at the time (Time)
I think I'm handlin' just fine (Just fine)
No, I can't lie I make mistakes (Mistakes)
But I know I'm gonna be okay (Okay)

[Pre-Chorus: Chloe]
Got the weight of the world on me (Me)
But no regrets, this is what I say

[Chorus]
Watch out, world, I'm grown now
It's about to go down
My heart beatin' so loud
Mama, look, I'm grown now
(I'm grown!)

[Bridge: Chloe & Halle]
(Oooh)
(I'm grown!)
You can tell me nothin'
(Oooh)
(I'm grown!)
Like a heart, I'm stuntin', babe
(Ooooh)
(I'm grown!)
You can tell me nothin'
(Oooh)
