"Sam Smith Lyrics
""One Last Song""

Maybe one day
I won't sing about you
I'll sing a song about someone new
But right here, right now
You are on my mind
And I think about you all the time
I'm sending a message to you
And I'm hoping that it will get through

When it was good it was bittersweet honey
You made me sad 'til I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me
So this is what I will do
Maybe you're listening
So here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

And I hope it makes you feel
And I hope it makes you burn
And I hope it reminds you of how much it hurt
I'm sending a message to you
And I'm hoping that it will get through

When it was good it was bittersweet honey
You made me sad 'til I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me
So this is what I will do
Maybe you're listening
So here's one last song for you

In case you hear this
Then know you're the love of my life
Want to tell you I'm sorry
I miss having you by my side
When you were mine

When it was good it was bittersweet honey
You made me sad 'til I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me
So this is what I will do
Maybe you're listening
So here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you",0.972,275

"So pure, so honest, so open... how could someone bring pain to something so beautiful. Thank you for taking us on this amazing musical journey. I respect you and your craft on many levels. The unloved, invisible, taken for granted, overlooked have a true voice in this world now. People don’t like to hear the realness of this complicated world and choose to shut you down and give you the negative stigma. But FUCK THAT i won’t hide my truths. Pain surrounds my life and won’t release me. Love hasn’t been a visitor hardly ever but I’m still surviving and standing.",0.8835,125
