"Colin Webb how do these not do VR?? If they can project an image over the entire lense then ya it's capable of vr. Think about it for a split second. If they can make it look like a hologram is infront of you then they can do that same thing with an 360 video or environment. 

So what makes you think this ""can't do VR"" ?",0.6848,74
Colin Webb why can't you have a VR experience with this headset? What a stupid comment. You sound like an apple fanboy who has no idea what he's talking about.,-0.4767,33
"DVD box? No. VHS tape, which is bigger than a DVD case.
At arms length? No. Half arms length.
That's a pretty significant difference, and I keep hearing it everywhere from people who either skimmed the article where that information came from, or just got it from other people.

"I hope people realize that this is going to have to use the same concept of 3d that 3d movies use.  Sending two different images to each eye to give you the 3d effect.  Many complained about the 3d causing nausea, so wouldn't this be the same problem?  I never had that problem with 3d movies, but wasn't that why 3d kind of flopped at the theater, and 3d tv's also?  Then there was the group that said they might like 3d at the theater or for tv if you could get rid of the glasses.  I don't know,  it just sort of sounds like something that again, is going to turn a lot of people off.  If they can't handle a simple 3d movie at the theater and don't like it and don't like wearing the glasses, how are they all going to handle this?  As for me, it sounds very interesting, but like I said, 3d movies at the theater didn't bother me anyway, I like them just fine.",0.9781,189
I love how Rony dressed up for the occasion.,0.6369,10
"I think Rony's point is that it is not just a screen that you are seeing like all other AR devices.  It's an entirely different form of display technology.  I agree it is still technically AR or Mixed Reality which ever term you prefer.  It's about product differentiation.  If it was your company/product and you were making a completely new type of vehicle and someone called your product a ""car""... I'm sure you would try to explain the differences to make sure people don't dismiss any news about you as ""Oh, it's just another car.""",0.8225,108

Most of the people who'd want to watch the games via Magic Leap simply won't even be able to afford the headset. It's going to cost way more than most people could manage to pay. I'm the rich folks out there will be real happy though.,0.802,49

"Rony, enough of all the marketing spiel hyperbole--it's basically just a variation of augmented reality that you're making. It's a pair of glorified ""AR"" glasses (with a small wearable computer unit supplying the main processing) that project a fake holographic image in front you (apparently by beaming some kind of light field directly onto your retina or something like that)--currently shown inside a tiny windowed view area about the size of a DVD box held at arms length away from your face (according to hands-on reports)--and a basic controller for one-handed input. Stop using marketing spiel to try and make ignorant people believe this is more than what it is, especially right now with some of the big limitations it has like the tiny field of view.

I do not like this Rony guy: He is like a mix of an insidious marketing man and NLP master using very abstract and confusing wording so people never really quite know what he's describing and therefor have no proper opportunity to critically judge how good or bad it is at doing what he kinda isn't really ever describing very clearly in the first place. 

The people getting hyped about stuff like Magic Leap basically want to see cool 3D objects and information projected in front of them, be it a game of basketball of a Pokemon standing in front of them at the supermarket or whatever, overlaid onto the real world in this case, and you're basically doing that by using suped-up AR glasses (albeit using a light field method to project the image and within a really small field of view). Just say that, and stop with all the jargon and manipulative crap!

PS. The interviewer I like, because he calls it exactly as it is and isn't afraid to ask the hard questions or point in the some of the very real truths at this point. Kudos.",0.9413,350

"The NBA was an early adaptor of not just VR but actually perfecting virtual reality capture inside of stadiums. It's not nearly as simple as capturing a concert with simple 360 cameras compared to when you have to follow fast-moving action with multiple camera angles and render it all into something compatible with all types of headsets. Live action Volumetric capture combined with Motion Capture is several orders of magnitude more difficult than VR, so it's really a big pat on the back for Magic Leap that they are the chosen tech partner.",0.1927,97

"Well said but this is the point in many technologies being developed. Almost certainly the need for further development and actually ramping up some income flowing into these companies is the reason for these partnerships.

"What an utter waste of this technology! Why work on a local entertainment service (basketball mostly US focused) when it could be used for useful international uses such as wayfinding, education and science?. The entertainment is one way to sell things but that space is infamous for being transitory (I won't mention the P word here but I'll include that). I know this tech and know what it's capable of - which is amazing things, but Rony really is believing his own BS on this and needs to get more Elon in terms of working out how this is REALLY going to change the world.",0.9143,116

Some people even insist on calling their initial tech demoes fake, to which I call bullshit. It was perfectly clear what state of the technology those demoes were recorded through if you just tried looking for answers. In either case. I'm out, you can either say yes or no to my previous question. Any other response get us nowhere.
