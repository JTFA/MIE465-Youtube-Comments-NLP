"It's too bad BTS wasn't selected for the closing ceremonies. But given their huge exposure already. 

The Korean Olympic committee may have thought EXO a better fit don't know.  I mean I can completely understand CL being selected however. 

As who else really to represent Korea than the queen bee herself!! I get teary-eyed just thinking about it. 

But BTS and CL would have made such a legendary performance. But at least one Russian figure skater will be extremely happy to see them lol.  :b",0.8904,95

"master 
Actually, 2 of them can play piano and 1 plays the saxophone. 3 members are songwriters as well as record producers who also write all their songs & produce a lot of them as well. And they're not a band, they're a group of dancers, singers & rappers so they're not supposed to play instruments, even though half of them actually can play some. On stage they give outstanding performances where they dance and sing live at the same time which not many people can do & is also way more difficult than playing instruments. Also, most fans are in their 20s (including me) but they have also tons of fans in their 30s, 40s, 50s and even 60s with 20-25% of the fanbase being male.",0.7805,142
