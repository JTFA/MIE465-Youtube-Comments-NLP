They will be severely punished if they are caught doing so as in the case of Michael Slager's murder of Walter Scott. U.S. Law Enforcement are also not allowed to cross the border into a foreign nation to chase, apprehend, or kill suspects without the permission of the foreign nation's government unless it is a nation they are at war with.

We also live in a nation where there is presumption of innocence until proven guilty. You keep throwing out hypotheticals that the fleeing solider could be a criminal fleeing authorities for legitimate crimes instead of thought crimes. But there is no evidence of such, and thus he must be treated as any other person.

Free societies allow citizens to leave at will, don't have police or miltary execute people who are unarmed or try to flee, and treat everyone as innocent unless proven guilty.",-0.9627,182
