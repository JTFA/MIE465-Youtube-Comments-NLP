Jesus loves you! 

The Word says that God so loved the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16 paraphrased)

Friends, The Lord is not angry at you and neither does He hate you! He came down from heaven in the Person of Jesus Christ to die, and 3 days later, rise again for all of us! 
Hallelujah!

The Lord is not against us, He is FOR us!

Repent and put your faith in Jesus!

He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him! (John 6:37 paraphrased)

So come to Him today! 
Call upon Him, and you will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

He will forgive you, make you new, and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

All you need is mustard seed faith and sincere words of the heart. 

Shalom!",0.9932,190
