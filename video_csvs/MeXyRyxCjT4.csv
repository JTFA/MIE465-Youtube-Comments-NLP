"Dogs are so pure, most Humans are living in the fast lane to get money, and cheap temporary happiness. (Things, food etc)
Dogs, they just want to relax, walk, bath in the sun, sit, walk around, and just be with their family. They are living life in the moment, not trying to climb a ladder of numerical success. 
They live far shorter lives than we do, but do their most to make every moment count, and that is a beautiful trait of the species. And that is something more humans should do, something other than being another statistical cog in society.",0.9022,121
