The Tessa ball isn't giving electricity I think I think what u see is plasma ðŸ¤”,-0.2584,16
"The electricity was different colors because of the mediums of contact. The tiny burst of plasma causes the contact areas to rapidly oxidize, or burn. When you use your finger, it burns your skin amd the oils contained therein",0.0,43
"The main reason that the jar didnt charge sometimes is because you didnt hold onto the foil. That is why the whole thing works. The foil is grounded by the person touching it and so it gains a relative negative voltage compared to the water. This means that the water pulls more current into it and so the cycle repeats until the water cannot hold anymore and discharged through the plastic or through the air

Also a cool thing to do with these jars is to connect lots of them in series and charge the whole system. This will produce a much greater effect. This also works with lemons if you want a different experiment - run a light bulb/LED with lemon power",0.4728,130
The plasma ball is AC and doesn't charge the capacitor,0.0,10
The plasma ball would over charge the layden jar causing ot to leak to the aluminium foil and self discarge,-0.34,20
The reason (i think) for the diffrent colours of the spark is becouse of the ion's of the material that is touching it. Al makes white/blue and you body's ion's like Na give yellow/red sparks.,0.5267,43
"The reason the plasma bulb doesn't charge it is because it's producing ac voltage at a very high frequency 35,000 Hz , meaning it charges it positive one cycle then discharges it and recharges it to negative 35000 times a second.",-0.296,42
"The reason the plasma globe did not charge it is that the plasma globe is high frequency alternating current. You need a dc current to charge it. So, build a Van de Graaf generator!",0.0,38
"The spark between that metals was blue mostly because of the emission spectrum of gases in the air and that is mostly blue color. But when you were touching it with your finger the color changed due the ions from your ""burning"" skin. :D And the plasma bulb didn't charge the jar because it outputs high frequency AC voltage so it was something like charging and discharging pretty fast. Maybe it could work through a rectifier.",0.8918,82
