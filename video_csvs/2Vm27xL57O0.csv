Are you sure the flicker was caused by the LED's ? Big Clive tore down a flickering LED and finally found out it was caused by a bad diode in the power supply - you can skip to end of his video to when he finally finds the culprit after trying everything else https://youtu.be/UerFD3AgJHE,-0.296,54
Cree bulbs are crap they lasted a week. we’ve had ge ones that have lasted 4 years so far .,-0.3818,23
"Designed to operate right on the edge of thermal specifications to guarantee a short service life (and revenue stream for the manufacturer). I mod mine down to 5W or so (by changing the current setting resistor), they run significantly cooler and last much longer.",0.25,51
"Don't know why leds need to be in bulb form, just to be compatible with old fixtures. If you would go for new lamp, light or whatever, it would be better to have led on larger area for cooling reasons",0.4404,44
"EXACTLY! Plus, because the LED lights can last for many years if designed properly, there is no need to keep them in the easily replaceable, but limiting, form.",0.1007,34
"Edin Fific, If you have a product that should last 4-8 years can only last a few months or a couple of years (when there IS the tecnical expertise and tools to have them last MUCH longuer) then, or they do it INTENTIONALLY, or they are INCOMPETENT. If the product is Phillips or similar (when suposedly quality is reflected in the price) then it should be CRIMINAL as it is a CON. But we are used to be fed with programmed obsolesence as a norm (be it hardware degradation, outdated software, new technology that is barely better or fast paced fashion).",-0.8677,115
"I do exactly the same. Cut their power down to a half or a third, and they should last much longer, as far as the heating issues are concerned.
I just don't agree that they INTENTIONALLY make them short-lived. It's simply the issue of manufacturing cost vs. profit, plus there isn't much ""wiggle room"" with the standard light bulb sizes to allow sufficient cooling at above 5W.",0.1506,77
I have GE LED bulbs that have also been working for almost 10 years now.,0.0,16
"I have not used GE before, will keep that in mind when I buy more LED bulbs.",0.0,19
"I really appreciate your videos! Especially the ones on the topic of RF, but this video covering a light bulb is also interesting to watch.",0.7039,28
I will check out some newer ones and see how they stack up in the long term.,0.0,18
"I'll never buy Cree again. The 2 ~10W dimmable bulbs I bought admittedly ARE dimmable, but make horrendous noise when dimmed! Unbelievable.",-0.6476,27
"I've generally had good luck with Cree.  Overall the build quality was good for this unit, too.",0.8316,20
"I've had very good experience with the newer Osram/Sylvania products.  Not that I use them all over the house, as I prefer incandescent.",0.4927,28
"It´s possibly to almost definitely the dimmer. You need a true sine one. The sine chop ones are horrendous, they emit noise of all the RF spectrum and and really bad for the input diodes and capacitors of the LEDs.",-0.5245,46
Mine makes noise too. It could be dimmer though. But some bulbs arguably make less noise with the same dimmers I have.,-0.25,25
"Some of them you can, I shopped around locally until I found some that were both easy to open, used a quality unpotted switched-mode supply and were still relatively inexpensive at around 4€ a piece. They used screws to hold the LEDs and front heatsink plate and the circuit board connected to the socket with contacts so it could be easily pulled out with pliers.",0.5106,70
Thanks!,0.4926,2
That's impressive!,0.5562,3
You can't easily open up most of these bulbs though.,-0.2584,11
me too :),0.4588,3
near the end of the video the metal plate you attached the leds too is from the bottom of a microwave oven the covor for the turntable motor. ;),0.2263,30
