"A bit crazy and insane, I love it.  I'd say I've seen more about boats on YouTube than any other source. Not tha I wouldn't be able to learn a lot from the two books I've found out about on YouTube, recommended by sailors world wide, which are ""Boatowner's Mechanical and Electrical Manual, Nigel Calder "" and the engine manual coming from Nigel . A few things I've resolved to learn are, learning about various engine heat exchanger systems, rigging rebuilding, and Nigel starts wit chapter 1 , ""Establishing a Balanced Battery üîã Powered Electrical System"" because, no batteries, no radio, lights, can't start engine,ect. One lady with a YouTube channel, WhiteSpotPirates Nike, I've watched her entire adventure, which we would call a ""School of hard knocks"" meaning, learning from what happens to your equipment when you do not know where preventative maintenance should be done ( fo her engine, replacement of a rubber timing belt, and a friend, heat exchanger, impeller, ect). One boat has gone down , thru hole maintenance . Good luck",0.8481,207

Check out  channels 'MJ sailing' and 'learning the lines' for more advice on this.
Best advise is to use the boat ( does it even have a mast?) and learn what works and what does not and fix as you go and try to do it in a marina with lots of other friends doing the same. You need lots of support to do a multi year project like this.

"Justyna, Your boat is a good find, I wouldn't worry about the age that much, my sailboat is Turandot she is a 1963 Choey Lee Robb Yawl 35' built from Burmese teak. The land lovers over here in the US are afraid to haul her because the older boats made from pine don't do well being hauled, and the marina personal won't let me stay on her because I don't have the insurance for lability and since I had a bilge pump problem last time out the US Coast Guard black flagged my boat that was 6 months ago. I added a automatic sump pump that If she loses power from shore she will sink. So a gas generator to run the sump pump I moved her to where she is now. To get insurance on her I need to get hauled for a survey, but I can't get hauled without insurance and the Marinia can't untie her and set her free or be found liable by the coast guard.

"This is quite a surprise seeing my home country in this video.  I  come from a boat building family and I built boats myself and  often sailed around Malta.  I was born in Malta and apart from 15 years in Britain, I lived on the island and I know every square inch that was shown in this video including the quarry.  Yes. I fully agree. that Malta and its harbours are amongst the best in the world with the added advantages that we have some very historic Bastions all around the Harbour.  The weather in Malta is kind through out the year and perhaps December, January and February could be a little cold, but it never snows so that will give some idea of what we face.     That boat seems to be made of steel and nothing that a little welding could not fix.    This young lady is to be admired and I do not think that it is beyond her capability to get it all trimmed to  take to water.  
Malta is not the place it used to be.   About 80 years ago, it was a remarkable place where we could build the traditional boats without too many restrictions. We built the traditional, Luzzu, Kajjik, Frejgatina, Dghajsa, Firilla,  and others.
The El Farouk which exploded at the dockyard, I know the full story as though I did not cover the court investigation, I did cover many court cases during the last 50 years, including death at the local Dockyard and industry.  Dockyards are wonderful places as far as technology is concerned and joining the Royal Naval Dockyard in 1954 was such an exciting time working on all types of Naval craft including gun control  and secret coding machines and torpedoes. I proceeded with all this at Chatham Dockyard before I went to Newcastle upon Tyne, where I even played with the models Parsons made and also climbed on the Turbina the first steam turbine ship. That had nine propellers, three on each shaft as they had trouble with cavitation with the high speed turbines.      
Well good luck to this lady,   coming summer I shall try to look her up as see how she is getting on with this venture. Any way , Congratulations for her courage.",0.9912,411
