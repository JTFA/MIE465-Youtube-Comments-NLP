"Been snowboarding for over 15 years, went to Chamonix and got stuck on a t bar that was the only way out back to our car at the end of the day.  Granted this thing was probably over a mile and super steep, but I  tried around 10 times and kept falling 3/4 of the way up at a turn that was super steep and banked.  Finally made it out but that was probably the most stressed I'd ever been.  So yea those things are rough.",0.5204,92

Jesus Christ is the biggest piece of shit on 2 feet. Please do not worship this piece of crap. With all the violence and terrorism going on in today's world you must come to realize religion is a waste of time. Christ cannot do a thing for you he could not even save himself from the cross. He was nothing but an overrated piece of shit magician. All religion is designed to keep the week in control. Stay away from the piece of shit name Jesus Christ.Thank you.,-0.9672,95
