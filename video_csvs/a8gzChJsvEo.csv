"I don't really agree with the sin at 13:33, the whole point of Louise and Ian's job was to figure out a way to communicate with the aliens, as to get the real reason they arrived in the first place; hence the argument for teaching them kindergarten words. If Louise had managed to communicate enough to start understanding their language, I think it would be safe to assume she had managed to teach them enough to understand ours as well. 

Although, since we find out the Heptapods don't see time as linear, it would probably be safe to also assume that the aliens did in fact know english (and all other languages) from the very beginning. However it seems as though that would've made it too easy for us. I think the idea was that the Heptapods wanted us to actually LEARN the language, not just be given it. And of course to inevitably work together to finish learning the language. After all, they needed humanity as a whole to help save them in the future, not divided as they were.",0.806,199

To everyone else, the general for example, yes they have lived the past.. but she had yet to live the past and the present yet. It‚Äôs like things were explained right the beginning.. the aliens form entire complex sentences starting at the beginning and the end and meeting in the middle, filling in the exact space needed.. this is how she lived her life.. this is why at the beginning of the film we are seeing her past whilst she sees the future even though she has not yet started to learn the language that give her the ‚Äòpower‚Äô",0.8807,191

"I have a theory for 10:01 the soldiers in those suits are paid, and are covered medically, by the DoD, Louise and Ian are not. They are putting themselves at potential risk by not remaining covered (even though they obviously don't experience any arm). The Army is not going to allow a soldier to create unnecessary risk that would potentially harm them and take them out of action. Commanding officers would have to authorize the removal of the covering and alter their SOP, and for that he would need substantial evidence that they wouldn't be harmed by the environment; something that clearly isn't on his list of priorities.
