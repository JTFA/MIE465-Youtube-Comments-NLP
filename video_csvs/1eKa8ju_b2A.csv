"If you ever want to know why men refuse to date and prefer 2D digital pictures/drawings, or porn, to actual real relationships, well look no further then this. Generally speaking, accusations follow with trials, judges, a jury, evidence, and people actually trying to discuss whether a wrong doing has occured. Innocent until proven guilty is there for a reason, and not to favor criminals, but to ensure that justice is actually enacted and not an injustice. ""Me-too"" has been Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Did some people get justice? Absolutely. Did some people get falsely accused and have their lives irrevocably damaged? Absolutely. One thing this has definitely achieved is a toxic environment for men who want a relationship. It is no longer safe for a male to make any sort of first move. Legally or socially. This has created an environment so toxic, that it makes being single forever a more favorable option. Companionship? Get cats/dogs. Sex? Everyone has hands, and there's plenty of toys on the market that are better then the real thing for both men and women. Kids? Adopt. Relationships? Hell no to the nopity nope nope. People driven by logic and rational thought cannot justify the risk. I am fully aware that women risk their lives every time they date, guys do to and always have. Is it swayed one way vs the other? Yes, always has been. Does that mean ""justice"" is swaying it to the other side? Not at all. If women were justified to point out the inequity of power when the needle swayed too far on the mens side, then men are entirely justified to point out when that inequity of power shifts the other way too.",0.9858,337
