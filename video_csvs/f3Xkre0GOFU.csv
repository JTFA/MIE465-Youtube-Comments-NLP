And no guarantee that any of these meds, will be beneficial at all..(your best bet is to eat right& get all the vitamin& minerals your body needs to stay strong. Of course wash hands& keep hands off your face, use/bring sanitizer when going out. Cough into a tissue if you can, or your sleeve.. Hospitals have those masks you can wear to avoid spreading& or picking up any new germs..   Just basic common sense. Nothing complex) They offer the masses MORE shots, MORE Big Pharma Meds that don't guarantee any benefit. And the side effects are endless. Yet so many still suggest taking them.. Imagine doctors used to suggest smoking for anxiety. Today we know this is an insane suggestion. Same deal). And this woman can't possibly believe her advise is 1size fits all. Ridiculous. Should the few that lost their lives to this man-made flu virus,, stay home too? Not seek medical attention? Poor advice.. They tragically took ill advice& paid with their lives.. I'm sure most people don't want to go to ANY stinking hospital. As their filthy on the best of days. But you know your body best.. Don't ignore the signs of more serious issues that can come up, when your body is already fighting a flu virus.. Too many of these nurse's are ignorant to others pain(1of these is too many)..

Offering shitty advice to the masses on a yt video.. Every patient is different.. Talk to your doctor& don't let a psyco like this, try to minimize your condition..

Sneezed into their hand and then opened up a door to the mess hall. Grown adults sneezed or coughed into the air like toddlers and others walked through the paths of that in the air. One person even blew their nose into their hand. Picked at what came out on their hand and then wiped their hands together as though that would make that whole mess magically disappear as they walked. I. Was. Mad. 

Luckily I only got a cold later. And that was after sis was already out of the hospital (i wore a face mask when i drove her home)for a few days and I had sequestered myself to my house so I wouldn't give it to her. People have NO clue.",0.25,209

"The antiviral drug Tamiflu has been touted as effective in reducing complications of flu such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Sales of the drug skyrocketed during the hyped bird- and swine flu pandemics of 2006 and 2009. But some of the evidence supporting its use has turned out to be based on fraudulent and/or missing data. 

Two employees of a communications company admitted they were paid to ghostwrite studies where the conclusion specifically had to be in support of Tamiflu‚Äôs effectiveness.

Side effects of Tamiflu include convulsions, delirium and delusions. The death of five Japanese children and seven adults has been linked to the drug. Disturbingly, a 2009 study found more than half of all children taking Tamiflu experience side effects, including neuropsychological effects such as altered behavior and nightmares. Other rare side effects such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and blindness have also been reported.

While antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu have been used with greater frequency, the traditional first line of defense against the flu has been vaccines. The evidence against flu vaccines is rapidly mounting as well, and in recent years, a number of damaging studies published in the medical literature, negating the claim that flu vaccine is the best form of flu prevention.",-0.9001,227

"The flu is also spread by the actual vaccine. Millions of people are suffering from vaccine induced injuries.

""If we take the combined figure of flu and pneumonia deaths for the period of 2001, and add a bit of spin to the figures, we are left believing that 62,034 people died from influenza. The actual figures determined by Peter Doshi, then at Harvard University, are 61,777 died from pneumonia and only 257 from flu. Even more amazing, among those 257 cases only 18 were confirmed positive for influenza. A separate study conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics for the flu periods between 1979 through 2002 revealed the true range of flu deaths were between 257 and 3006, for an average of 1,348 per year.

As it presently stands, it is not sound medical science, but primarily economic and political motivation which generate the immense pressure behind mass participation in the annual ritual of flu vaccination.¬†

It is a heavily guarded secret within the medical establishment (especially within the corridors of the CDC) that the Cochrane Database Review (CDR), considered by many within the evidence-based medical model to be the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic value of common medical interventions, does not lend unequivocal scientific support to the belief and/or outright propaganda that flu vaccines are 'safe and effective.'

""Influenza vaccination seems to be ineffective at any age. It is therefore strange that people still attempt to prove that the useless vaccine is safe.""---- [2006] Flu Vaccine Safety: Creating a Myth by F. Edward Yazbak MD¬†

""Imagine... the gullibility of a public that not only believes that these companies give them a safe and effective product but that they give them the credence of a god that two years in advance when they start making these serums they know which particular kind of influenza is going to be causing the epidemic two years later. I mean you know these people have the utter gall to tell people that they can do it because they can‚Äôt.""---FLU VACCINE: Interview of Dr Eva Snead by Gary Null

I always know when it's flu season. First, the media begins its usual role as hyterical government press secretary, uncritically trumpeting the same cooked numbers about the coming flu epidemic. ... NBC's Today Show (10/6/04), warn that the flu kills about 36,000 people every year in the United States. .....It's a crock, a lie, and a sham; a conspiracy to generate fear and stampede people to use a vaccine of questionable effectiveness to the benefit of pro-immunization bureaucrats, and big pharma. Sounds harsh, but follow the math and the money. ¬†When the major manufacturers of flu vaccine get together with the CDC in a closed door summit with the sole purpose of figuring out how to stick 185 million doses of a questionable vaccine into a population in which less than 1,000 people a year die, what should we call it? Yes, Virginia, it is a conspiracy. Luckily the conspirators are foolish enough to believe that their website is safely hidden amidst all the chaff of the Internet, or else, are so brazen in their contempt for the general population that they think we can't do a little math and conclude ""The vaccine doesn't work, and the flu is a flim-flam!"" ¬†The CDC should concentrate on finding ways to lower the spread, working alternatives to vaccines, and ways to minimizing the severity of the flu, rather than pumping out fake numbers, creating an aura of fear and hysteria, and shilling for profits to huge pharma companies. The Flu Scare Game by John Keller

''The CDC has large numbers of vaccine scandals buried in their files. One of them involves a vast over-exaggeration of flu deaths in the US every year. As researcher Peter Doshi noted, years ago, the old canned figure for annual flu deaths, 36,000, was a gross exaggeration. One year, the actual number of confirmed flu deaths in America‚Äîwhere the flu virus was positively identified‚Äîwas, wait for it: 18. Of course, the CDC uses those flu-death stats to convince Americans they must take the flu vaccine.'' ¬†[2016 April] Former NBC boss asserts his grandson damaged by vaccines by Jon Rappoport

""The flu vaccine gets the most-useless-vaccine-of-all-time award. Now the CDC is recommending the vaccine for children under two years old and all adults over 50. Don't fall for it.""---Randall Neustaedter OMD

""A week-long inspection by the FDA last summer into the production of the flu vaccine Fluvirin at the plant found Medeva had failed to: ‚Ä¢ 'clean, maintain and sanitise equipment at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunction or contamination'; ‚Ä¢ maintain systems to prevent unacceptable levels of toxins and bacteria contaminating the production process; ‚Ä¢ ensure batches of vaccines 'conformed with all established standards, specifications and characteristics'; and ‚Ä¢ prove that vaccines on doctors' shelves would be free from 'bacteria and fungi'.""--Media
