Darling
Don't cry snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby

I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'll miss the snow 'till death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero
And hide from the sun
I love you forever
Well, we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now it's Christmas, baby

"Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
울지마요, 내 눈사람, 내 앞에서 녹지말아요

Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling
당신이 날 잡지 못하면 누가 당신의 눈물을 닦아주겠어요

If you can't catch me, darling
당신이 날 잡지 못한다면

Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way
녹지마요, 내 눈사람, 날 이렇게 떠나지마요

A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
물이 되버리면 나와 함께할 수 없어요

Can't hold me close, baby
날 안아줄 수 없어요




I want you to know that I'm never leaving
내가 떠나지 않을 거라는 걸 당신이 알았으면 좋겠어요

Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
당신이 나의 영원한 집이에요

Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey
다리가 없으면 누가 날 데리고 갈 수 있겠어요

Without legs to run, honey
달릴 다리가 없다면 말이에요

Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
울지말아요, 내 눈사람, 눈물을 흘리지 말아요

Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby
당신이 귀가 없어지면 누가 내 비밀을 들어주겠어요

If you don't have ears, baby
당신이 귀가 없다면요

Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me

I want you to know that I'm never leaving

Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons
