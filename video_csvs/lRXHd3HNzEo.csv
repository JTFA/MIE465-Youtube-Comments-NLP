1/4 wavelength wave is best.  Load with an inductor (coil) in series for a shorter physical antenna.,0.6369,21
"A monopole should be 1/4th the wavelength (longer is never better; shorter is acceptable but worse) - but this assumes you have a large ground plane. If you don't have a large ground, then a dipole (i.e. a double monopole, L/4 to one side and L/4 to the other, so L/2 total wire-length) would be best, shorter is okay, but longer is never better. 
Think of it as if you have a sinusoidally varying electric field. You want to sample the highest and the lowest point (with say a superfast multimeter). Where would you put the leads of the multimeter? The red wire at the peak and the black wire at the valley - this is essentially the dipole --> L/2 distance between the peak and valley. If you go shorter with your leads (dipole antenna) you'll get a smaller measured voltage (signal strength). Having longer wires will never be better, as then you  would go ""downhill"" again.",-0.0183,197
"AM sucks balls, but that was cool.",0.296,9
"Aditya Mehendale sorry I couldn't get to reply earlier. In theory, multiples of 1/4 wavelength is better in some aspects, including better gain and directivity, in practice not, specially frequencies less than 1 Ghz which tend to have quite long wavelengths. Earth or soil, can be used as a ground plane but be sure to isolate the feedline center/positive/antenna from the soil/ground.",0.6908,76

"By definition, it would become a coil-loaded ""whip"" antenna.  Inductive loads may be used for other antenna designs (dipoles and more exotic designs), but the simplest version is for a single wire, which most often is vertically oriented -- horizontal, long-wire,  (etc.) antennas often have tunable inductive elements that are used to match the physical portion to the frequency even more precisely than fixed coils.",0.0,80

"I take it you personally are not one of said people to pass the test to opperate a ham radio. It's probably good practice to actually know  the laws prior to falsley accusing someone of breaking them.
What you are saying is akin to ""well my golly, you have a 3.5mm to AM transmitter in your car, well you better have an amateur radio license to be broadcasting garbage from your phone all over random frequencies that no one outside of your car can pickup!"" That makes no sense right? Nor does you bitching about him creating a radio broadcast that can only be received within the confines of his own home. Which, by the way, is perfectly legal under part 15 of the FCC's rules regarding low power AM and FM transmissions, which states that unlicensed transmissions, both AM and FM are permitted with an effective service range of no more than 200 feet so long as they accept interference from any other devices. So, are you going to try and report someone for breaking laws that only exist in your head or what?",0.9145,202

"IIRC the theory... you always want the best aerial on the transmitter and then it matters less what aerial you have on the receiver. This is to do with getting your desired signal further above the 'noise floor'.
So maybe borrow the AM loop seen at 2.53 for the TX and use the wire (or a ferrite out of a junk AM boombox) for the receiver.
Might also be possible to tune the loop (which is inductive ofc) using a variable cap across the twisted pair feeder.",0.873,98

"Really enjoyed the video, awesomely simple solution.

I like sharing the following because I found it interesting when I discovered it:
Having done some research for a paper I wrote, hiding under a desk from an atomic bomb is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Just like regular bombs the damage is worst at the center and gets weaker as you get away from the center.  Essentially if you're at a distance from the detonation that you could see a flash and react to it (""duck and cover""), you're at a distance where the initial blast/heat isn't going to kill you, but the heat flash could still burn you and the flying debris from the incoming pressure wave could hurt you, so putting something between you and that debris/heat can actually prevent a lot of injuries.  

Also, while you would receive some dose of radiation, if you're at a distance from the epicenter where ""duck and cover"" would make a difference, it would not be a life threatening amount of radiation.  With the nuclear weapons currently in service around the world, if you're close enough to receive lethal radiation, you'll be killed in the initial blast anyway.  Interestingly, at these ""duck and cover"" distances the heat wave can still be strong enough to cause 2nd and even 3rd degree burns, but it's so brief that clothing and even something as thin as a sheet, tablecloth, or even newspaper can stop it from hurting you.  

So no, if you're near the center of the detonation it won't do you any good, that much is obvious.  But we're talking about a bomb that can have an effect on many square kilometers of area, and there is a significant portion of that area where ""duck and cover"" could quite possibly save your life and/or prevent injury.",-0.8895,346
"Richard Grier yeah, fair enough. The inductive ballast will help. It's just a long way from a quarter wave. May as well call it a whip antenna",0.8074,31

That indeed is quite interesting. What kind of radiation is involved? I guess alpha and beta are probably blocked by the air at the distance you survive the blast....,0.2247,32
"That's pretty awesome, you should buy a cheap wideband RF amplifier (you can get miniaturised ones from eBay and such, also they run on 5V), then link it up and see what the range is like afterwards.",0.8689,43
That's why a loading coil is used.  It matches (as closely as is practical) the impedance that the transmitter sees to that of a 1/4 wavelength antenna -- allowing a much shorter physical antenna to be used.,0.0,42
The AM transmitter made using an Arduino UNO is very electrically noisy. It broadcasts on a very wide range of frequencies without passive band-pass filters. How come this one isn't as noisy as the UNO?,-0.5497,38
The a tank filter centred at the Fc would work. But you could also use a switched capacitor filter and drive the clock with an output of the computer clock.,0.0,32
"The antenna length for a radio transmitter is generally some multiple of 1/4 wave length.  But that's only part of the story, the transmitter's output impedance should match the load impedance of the antenna.  This load impedance differs depending on the type of antenna you use.  I suspect that if you were to cut a wire the same length as the antenna and attach it to ground, you may get better range.  This wire is called a counterpoise and gives the antenna a ""ground plane"" to radiate from.  Or if held inline with the antenna wire, you'd have a dipole, though for a much higher frequency than intended. Also you could add a coil to the bottom of the antenna to add some inductance to it, which makes the antenna appear electrically longer to the transmitter. Good Luck!",0.6996,153
The point is to show what's possible with no components at all.. but how would the filter look like?,0.3919,21
"The warning should always suggest laying down with a paper bag over your head.

"This antenna is known as a monopole antenna, it's linearly polarized, so it must be aligned to be parallel  with the receiver antenna as much as possible specially with such low transmission power. It should also have a ground plane connected to the ESP32 ground and the antenna should be normal to it. Ground plane dimensions are not very critical, at least not for this, it's best if it's circular though. The antenna length commonly used is 1/4 of the wavelength or a multiple or fraction of that. The feed line, the yellow in this case, is best if it's shielded and the shield connected to the ESP32 ground as well as the ground plane.",0.8905,128

"the antenna type that you want is a monopole antena, that type require a length of 1\4 wavelength, but that requires a counterpoise to work properly. also an antenna do not works just by length, tha shape and position takes a good part of the data to characterize an antenna, also your transmitter do not have a constant output impedance so a precisely shaped antenna will be worthless. in this case coil up as much wire as you can and you will be fine :)
