Oh my indeed.
So taxes get taken from your check also? Or your unemployed/ tax evading which makes you the scum bag and not the country?
Also I find it hard to understand what your trying to get at, I mean are you calling the citizens bad or the country because like surely your being slightly hypocritical stating that you shouldn't live in the US but then you do live there.
Also I'm genuinely curious what is the dream country in your extremely rational and valid opinion, and also where you are originally from if not the US
My guesses: your dream country is like Spain or some other country in Europe (or maybe some country ran by communist but I'm not sure because your all about peace such as  anti gun violence and no racism which is fair but then you disagree with taxes. So I'm also slightly curious what you are left winged/right winged? )
And I guess that you're from Mexico and you illegally travelled to USA and now your slightly angry because you're not welcome and maybe some people were being racist.

+Coma White I thought the argument was on the moral justification of the USA killing civilians while in war time and peace time.,-0.8074,25
"+Coma White Its only logical that an invasion of a country will result in higher deaths for both sides of the combatants. The nukes used was to destroy Japan's capability to continue to wage war by targeting highly industrialized cities. America just happened to be the first country in joint with UK, and I believe Canada to devise the nuclear device. If the Soviet Union had a nuke available during the war then sure as hell they would use it. As so every other country during the war. The Americans faced one very serious problem. They knew for sure that the Japanese would defend their territory with zeal and that American casualties would be high – probably too high for the American public to accept. 

http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/
Politics play a role in every conflict world wide. Such with the Vietnam and Korean Wars. The invasion of Japan would have killed many Americans and if the public learned after that the USA had a weapon that could limit a lot of those casualties then it would be a total riot.

The American casualties were projected to be in the hundred thousands in the event of an invasion of Japan. Close to 700,000 American Deaths.

"+Coma White Nukes on Japan were justified. We warned the Japanese populace to move and relocate from the mainland cities but they didn't listen. What we did was horrible no denying it, but it was a war. If 2 countries are fighting each other and its becoming a draw then something is definitely wrong. Japan murdered millions of Chinese people and thousands of Philippines. Hiroshima was a city of both industrial and military significance to the Japanese and after we dropped it the Japanese refused to the surrender terms of the United States and was willing to still go to war. 90,000–146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000–80,000 in Nagasaki.
http://www.aasc.ucla.edu/cab/200708230009.html
China lost 3-4,000,000 military deaths and 20,000,000 civilian deaths by the Japanese.

"+Tuan Anh Hoang The second nuke dropped on Japan was because the Japanese Emperor did not accept the unconditional surrender terms the USA wanted. And the Emperor said he will continue fighting. If you had a chance to win a fight with a tool that is super effective, cheaper, and quicker would you use it? War is not meant to be fair all country have killed civilians because it lowers the manpower, industrial, and economical capability of the target countries. USA was just one of the countries that killed civilians. Great Britain, France, Soviet Union, German Reich, and every country in the war including the Canadians killed civilians. Is it good? Hell no. But to blame a singular country for civilian deaths is foolish. Hopefully nobody is hurt or misrepresents my comment as I am just exercising my perspective on the war.",-0.9757,161

Russian spy would be unqualified to be a President in the first place. If you're not born in the U.S. or have U.S. citizenship by the time of your birth, you're barred from becoming POTUS for the rest of your life. 

And there are a lot of measure to prevent U.S. nuclear arsenal from ever be used against itself. The POTUS can't set ICBM's target on a whim, and it can't be re-targeted quickly. Once ICBM crews received the launch code, they'll input the preset target in (but they don't know the exact target location). SLBM and bombers crews knew and can set the target (on their own discretion), but they can chose not to attack if they deemed target unreasonable, such as attacking the U.S., allies, or neutral countries. POTUS only give out launch order, there's no such thing as ""big red button,"" or ""President's nuclear computer.""

In addition, POTUS can't launch first strike without approval from other high-level officials.

Russia too has a similar structure. It takes their president, the head of military and the head of party to activate launch authority.

If you want to have real worries though, it will be countries in the Mideast and Asia Pacific that are the bigger problems. Many of their threats are within their theater. From detection of launch to impact is mere minutes. They have little time to decide if a real missile has been launched or some other event has occurred fooling their instruments.

Each base has 150 ICBMs assigned to it. These ICBMs are house in a LF, or launch facility. Approximately 15 LFs to a MAF, or missile alert facility. The MAF is where the officers with the corresponding launch codes and consoles are housed. Along with the security forces personnel to protect them and the LFs. There are no actual keys, only buttons, switches and codes. A MAF gets the signal from the Pentagon with the presidents codes. The officers open their locked briefcase with their corresponding launch codes and enter each into the computer. The officers arm and fire an ICBM. At one of the LFs, it's lid it's blown off with explosives, propelling the lid across a track and opening the silo. The ICBM is fired into space. The missile, a minute man III has the ability to be disarmed at any point during it's trip. The rocket is propelled into space, once in space, it's guided by another propulsion system to it's target, released, and given a spin for stability.

"who creates ""the challenge code"" and the ""biscuit"". How does the receiver of those codes know they are the correct. Who's in charge of that? Can there really be a ""secure"" line to call military? What if a highly specialized con team exploits and fakes a call. If everything is top secret how can those people involved know they are not being conned. I see a lot of workspace for manipulation. Correct me if im wrong.",-0.7691,90

"😂 US is one of the globalized business hubs in the world. If he nuked to North, China would get a better chance to get stronger in business than Donald. I am not worry about it because my country is just next to China. We need not to make much time to travel for business with coming along World No.1.  Donald Trump is a businessman. He thinks like a billionaire from the inside whatever current his status is. Americans voted for him because American Business is making free falling because of Obama whom he only knows politics in 8 years. China has 3 trillions. Americans have 3 trillions in debt. He only wants to sell his American made weapons. That’s all. He has no intentions to do so. Even he did like a Bush, then Asian bushes would be lined up for refugees like Mexicans, Syrians and other passive persons and third party would come join that club. Americans have to take care of them again with allies on behalf of UN Chairpersons by using tools like “Humanitarian activities”. Because they did. They have responsibilities. Even a man made a girl pregnant, he needed to take care of her because he did. His responsibility. So, American business will be delayed again. Everything is fine. US President wanna make an adorably good at marketing like Qatar and other Middle East countries affairs. Crystal clear. He doesn’t want anybody get hurt. He just wanted to sell his products before Russia and China. Literally, no-can-do because we live together. Think like a human. Think like a 2017 person. I have no clue for a Northern War.",0.9833,315
