"Clearly edited and or a glitch on the phone. But regardless is a ridiculous video as you would need the person's freaking face to even start building the mask. I think at the point someone kidnaps you and creates a mold of your face that could fool your phone you would probably rather be dead and could care less about your phone being unlocked.

Dumb marketing ploy and also a stupid video. ¬†Face ID works well and keeps people out of your phone. Nobody is walking around with masks especially since they don't know whose iPhone they are stealing.

They are MORE likely to pull a fingerprint off the phone itself if it was left behind and create a rubber fingerprint mold (which has been shown to beat Touch ID very easily). ¬†Your face isn't left behind if you lose your phone.

So what are we proving here? ¬†That if you spent godless amounts of time and had free access to your own face to map and scale a mold of your face that you could unlock it with a mask? ¬†Stop feeding the clickbait.",-0.9282,198

This underscores the fact it's possible to defeat the security with a low-cost but persistent effort. It won't take many generations of improvements for someone to find a similar hack method that works reliably and on a wider scale.
