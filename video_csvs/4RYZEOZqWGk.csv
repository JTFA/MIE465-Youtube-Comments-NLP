Yes, it's true that in northern Italy we have a longer history concerning the consuption of meat because northern Italians were richer, however the traditional ""poor's cuisine"" of northern Italy is largely based on vegetables too, think about the most famous northern Italian dish (polenta), consist just of corn flour and hot water.
The only difference between southern and northern cuisine is that in the north they eat more rice/soups and meat and use more cream/butter while in the south they consume more pasta, seafood and use more olive oil.
Both the north and south have sausages and cheeses, the regions with more sheeps/goats are all located in the south.",0.836,130

And please, go to therapy. You're an extremely aggressive being.

"Valerie Mc Phail 
Saying that you know something about the traditional cuisine or habits of the people of northern Italy just because you own an house in Rome (which is a huge city in central-southern Italy) it's like if I said that I know the culture of Michigan's countryside just because I own an house in Los Angeles.",0.5859,61
"Valerie Mc Phail 
Venice, Florence/Tuscany, Milan, Genoa and others have been some of the richest and most important states for 1.000 years until a century before the unification of italy, they had colonies and banks all over Europe while southern Italy was a Spanish/Arab/French colony for longer time, so northern Italians had more access to richer food and spices like saffron (one of the most expensive spice) which is extremely common in northern Italian cuisines, many northern italian dishes are original from that time.
It's true that north-eastern Italy was poorer between the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century, but that's because this land nedeed time to recover after being sold to Austria by Napoleon and being highly taxed by the new born country of Italy.
Friuli is an autonomous region and one of the richest part of Italy and probably the cleanest part of the country, people in northern Italy live on average 4 years more than southern Italians because they earn more, they have better health care, are more educated and eat better food.",0.9777,201
"Valerie Mc Phail Obviously the food traditions of northern Italy have to do with the climatic, territorial characteristics and with the ancient history of these lands, not with wealth. Po Valley and Alps mean cultivation of corn, pig and cattle breeding, and then the production of cheese, meat and cured meats.
Friuli is one of the ""poorest"" regions of northern Italy, however its per capita income is higher than the European average (Friuli ‚Ç¨29,900  EU ‚Ç¨ 28,900)",0.0762,90
"Valerie Mc Phail Valerie Mc Phail which part of ""personally I really like..."" didn't you understand? And about italians and Americans... american style and culture is realky strong here, so yes: generally, italians love americans. I've never said that is good or bad. And you don't know me, so you can use ""dummy"" for your friends, thanks.",0.9422,72

actually no matter how rich you are it is a tradition to be a good host which in her case was her husband`s mother-and thats shows an affection towards Jessica the fact that his mom was putting food on her plate and not somebody else  shows that her mother in law cared about her. wtf how come you think its weird what world are you living in.

Also, staying a lot of time at the dinner/lunch table only occurs during holidays or like, special occasions. We use it as an ""excuse"" to socialise and get to know other people. (In Spain they have something similar and call it ""the sobremesa""). Good thing is, however, if you're invited and the dinner drags on for a few hours, and then you take your time, eating, drink coffee afterwards, have a chat... chances are you're considered really part of the family! :)
