"""Pay a lot less tax"" what he's not telling you is that's only for a short time period then your middle class tax goes up and upper income earners stays low. Just a move to allow him to propose it that way and if not be a flat lie.",-0.1531,53

"""Trickle-down economics"" = bullshit - and here's why.  

During the Reagan years (which the economic conservatives luv to point to) the US economy was vastly different from today.  There was considerably more manufacturing base than today while those companies were mostly domestically owned.  Look at the stock market from the years 1950-1980 and see that the number of US businesses which were publically owned was fairly static.  Yet from the mid-1980's to the mid-1990's we see a huge jump in the number of publically traded companies.   We also however see the ""infamous"" era of ""hostile takeovers"" where companies which forayed into the market were then taken over and chopped up and sold by larger companies.  Yes it produced lots of wealth for those who ""flip paper"" in the stock market - but it cost lots of jobs for the working man who used to work for those companies who once were satisfied with low but stable profit margins in exchange for long-term stability but now found themselves perpetually seeking every higher profit margins in the short term regardless of how they were created.

By the late-1990's we see several things.  First - thanks to an increase in automation and the previously mentioned patterns of companies going public resulting in their primary focus now solely being appeasing their shareholders - jobs begin to outsource in order to obtain lower wages and thus higher stock dividends.  We also see the number of publically traded companies decline - due to consolidation in the market as noted. Most importantly however is what was alluded to above.  Companies now chasing an overriding desire to maximize profit in the short-term because they no longer are tied to the US per se - but rather to their stock holders who are not concerned about ""how"" the stock prices are maintained which was being done via outsourcing/flat wages/new technologies to increase production.

So along comes GW and his 2001 & 2003 tax cuts which like today were promised to generate growth and happy times all around.............except it did not happen.  The companies instead took their new found windfall - and they either dumped it overseas so as to not pay taxes on it - creating even higher stock dividends - or else they invested it in *NEW TECHNOLOGY* which over time *ELIMINATES* jobs.  Additionally they did *NOT* increase wages as promised as the median wage - which had been flat since the mid-1990's - continued to remain stagnant despite record profits by the companies.  A study by Ball University a few years back showed that over the past 15 years the largest driver of job loss in the US was not trade deals blah, blah, blah - rather it was new technologies which companies have been systematically investing in and which has accounted for 70% of all lost jobs in the US.

Moral of the story:  the US economy today has nothing in common to the economy of the Reagan years - thus what worked then will not work now for the reasons noted.  The past 20 years have demonstrated that tax cuts and corporate welfare results - not in large scale job creation or higher wages - but in stock market growth resulting in the companies making higher profits flipping paper + taking their that profit and investing in more technology which ultimately destroys even more jobs. The world of Reagan no longer exists............it is as noted a new breed out there in a global marketplace - and they are not concerned with investing in workers per se - merely themselves.",0.9907,659

"+Michael - the exodus of industry from the US has jackshit to do with the corporate tax rate which as noted in the reports is actually less than the posted rate since said corporations additionally have a plethora of tax write-offs they employ which act to considerably lower the real rate they end up having to pay.  So pointing to the nominal corporate tax rate = straw man argument.

Next - profit.  Despite the purported onerous corporate tax rates - corporates have none the less been doing well with excellent posted profits while the stock market as it always does has continued to grow under the anticipated promise of even more profit to come.  Yes the Top 1% pay most of the taxes - because they make most of the wealth in the country.  Unlike the lower income however - they additionally as alluded to before have access to the tax attorneys and countless tax mechanisms which when added significantly reduce what they pay.  Net result - millionaires and billionaires who shuffle their incomes around and end up paying a lower effective tax rate than the working poor.",0.9066,197

It's big businesses that end up saving... at 15% reduction! compared to 1.1% reduction for those making over 500k.

"{chuckle}  Even when the unemployment rate was higher - the stock market continued to climb while as noted the median wage in the US remained stagnant for the past 20 years.  The Dow is only an indicator for those who flip paper as noted before.  It is *NOT* an indicator of improvement for the average American worker's status.  I seem to recall a mere few years ago as the unemployment rate was gradually ticking down that all the conservative pundits were blathering on for months on end about how it was due to workers leaving the workforce etc. and was supposedly not an indicator of an improving economy as the Obama administration was stating.............ironic how opinions change after an election.  Hahahahhahaha!  

Moral of the story:  all that matters is the data and history and not the endless recycling of the conservative talking points administration after administration about how giving tax and regulatory cuts will trigger rainbows and lollipops for all.  We have seen now for the past 25 years a steady decline in the American worker's standard of living - while we see at the same time as noted tax and regulatory cuts being passed as GW did before which ended up changing nothing.......save for making already profitable companies even more profitable.  Enjoy the Matrix Neo.",0.8258,234
