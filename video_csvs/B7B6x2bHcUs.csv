"...and you will know us by the Trail of Dead.   My friend alabama did not fall for globalism. In an unprecedented move a court in alabama just hours before the election reversed lower court decisions and declared that no record would be kept on electronic voting. This is a complete fraud. There may be violence but there will be no concession. This was the dirtiest political campaign in history and it was for all the chips. The state never votes democrat but now in the most important political vote in american history the voters of alabama vote against their own interest to maintain globalism, ill legal immigration and the deep state. It defies reason.",-0.8863,124

"Mark Ogle That is not true. Our Secretary of State is a Republican and stated that records are to keep for several years in compliance with state law, However, the specific records Roy Moore wanted to be preserved (i.e. the pictures of the ballots from the voting machines) simply did not exist. Of course, the actual paper ballots are being kept along with the official vote counts.",-0.3252,78
"Mark Ogle Well, I have not seen the people of Alabama protesting in the streets about this. I have also yet to see a valid legal strategy from Moore to contest the results of the election. So...",-0.0516,41
