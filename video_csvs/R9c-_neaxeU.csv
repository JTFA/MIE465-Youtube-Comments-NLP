+Jean-Jacq du Plessis Youâ€™re right: MENACE settles into a general strategy pretty quickly but there are often a lot of boxes that have not been â€˜trainedâ€™ yet because they fall outside the normal strategy. If you play unusually so MENCE has to use untrained boxes it will get worse for a while until those boxes are trained (Michie did exactly that in 1961).

"Again, I don't think you're clearly understanding the scenario I'm describing. (Or maybe it's me not understanding you, sorry.) I'll try to draw out what I'm saying so it's a bit clearer. Imagine MENACE is having to choose from the following game state (I put a dash instead of a zero because zero looks just like the letter O): 

O X -
2 2 2
O X 2

In this case, let's assume that MENACE randomly choose the first spot in the second row. It will then win! Now, according to the rules of the game, it will increase that position's value by 3 and leave the other numbers untouched. This means that the next time it faces this game state, it will look like this:

O X -
5 2 2
O X 2

Now, again, it might randomly choose the winning spot here, but it also might not. However, if instead of just increasing the value of the winning position, we add another rule that on that winning game state board, we also zero out the non-winning spots, we will get instead this game state (remember, the dashes are zeros):

O X -
5  -  -
O X  -

When faced with this choice, MENACE will always choose the winning position! By zeroing out the other spots, we have eliminated the possibility (for this game state) that MENACE will randomly choose the non-winning position.

"I tested out the software of Menace. It was fun to spend a few hours with. Of course forcing it to always lose is hard, so forcing it to always play the same opening moves meant that I could literally force it to go edge as it's starting move, some luck was involved of course, seeing as I had to beat the corner and center plays 8 times without it ever drawing or winning, only allowing edge to win, which is hard when your opponent basically is a smart randomizer, so after many failures I eventually managed to do it, forced menace to always play edge.

Then I forced it to literally only win if it played the straight game edge center opposite edge.
It's a lot more manageable, as it will naturally occur as long as you don't play in those 2 boxes.
As I allowed Menace to do that, I also forced there to be states where I always win.
For instance when I played center. which caused menace to automatically resign.
So it was definitely fun abusing the program.

However if you aren't intentionally forcing the machine into a perpetual losing state, by eventually forcing it to give up for all eternity as it has no legal starting move, it will after a while always end up winning or in a draw. Mostly drawing, there are after all only 8 states that will end up with a draw, and 4 states that will end up in a win, for menace, meaning eventually the result will always be a draw.
That is at least the case with Menace against Menace 2. And what tends to happen in a game with only a couple of gamestates. It may be hundreds of states, but most of them will never occur. The double row win con is possible to force, however good luck doing it.",0.9493,346

"To be clear, I don't mean that it's strategy to play the game. I'm referring to strategy for collecting, storing, manipulating, and using data. Assigning game states to match boxes, assigning game moves to colored beads, adding and removing beads according to game results, etc. All of that is human strategy.

I'm not sure which video includes this, but they discuss the idea of MENACE as the second player, and how the setup would be different; that it's essentially a different game to learn. In other words, they must use a different strategy to do it.",-0.7295,113

"Why no discussion of false optima? My understanding was that the corner strategy was objectively better than centre strategy because of the increased number of ways of winning, but this shows that it's a less learnable strategy because it is so reliant on making a good second move.
I know the second variant learned the corner strategy, and that's a very good example of how different learning algorithms can get stuck in false optima...",0.8987,79
"Why not modify the algorithm to take all the beads away of a particular color if Menace loses on the next turn? You could also extend this concept by changing the weights based on the turn in which Menace wins or loses; if Menace loses, take away all the beads of it's last move (N),  3 beads of move N-1, 2 beads of move N-2, and 1 bead of move N-1. Increase the weights of a win of draw similarly.",-0.6124,96

I've watched every one of your videos on this channel, but today was the first time i had come across your second channel, (YAYYY MORE MATHS!!!) i feel like you ought to do more to advertise your second channel cos the content there is just as mad as the content you have here!
