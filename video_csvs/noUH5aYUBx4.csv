"FOOD FOR THOUGHT:
Net neutrality came into being in 2015 when the internet was  put under the Telecommunications Act of 1934 to give the govt. more control of the internet.  With this control of the traffic ect., they could actually dictate what you could view and in what order! Also the govt. could tax your internet usage anytime and control the costs if they wanted to.  Now the internet is pre 2015 again!  Before 2015 there was nothing worng with the Internet!  It is in a better place again and innovation can occur and this will eventually bring prices down overall.  Remember the telephone company breakup?  It took a few years but competition drove the prices down.  I love the way this was labeled as NEUTRAL, so people would think it was a good thing, when it is a real concern to consumers by having the govt. control the internet!  Look at communist nations:  the internet is a threat to them because it allows free information exchange!  Best the American govt. stay out of the internet now and forever!  Glad it's out of the govt. hands again regardless if it's a Democratic or Republican govt.!",0.9781,219

Ted Kennedy, regarding the introduction of the Immigration Act of 1965
""The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.""Ted Kennedy, U.S. Senator, speaking to the Senate regarding the introduction of the Immigration Act of 1965
The Immigration Act of 1965 was called the ""Hart Cellars Act"". It was 100% Jewish written and sponsored. Jacob Javits pushed it through the Senate NOT Teddy Kennedy. It was written by Myer Feldman. and originated with Rabbi Minkoff and the ADL. It was ethnic warfare against white from the start. Today 50 years later is Jews like Schumer and ADL and New York Times that are still promoting mass immigration to destroy the white majorityIsrael Cohen, A Racial Program for the Twentieth Century, 1912
""We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negros. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.""
