I agree it could seem forced and tokenistic if not handled well. But bear in mind he's only 16. Thats when most people start to understand their sexuality.,-0.3213,31
"I agree, and even the death, destruction & mayhem films were often better than today's. Cagney in ""Public Enemy"" and ""White Heat"", Stanwyck in ""Night Nurse"", and all those John Gilbert pictures, S. Hayakawa in ""The Cheat"", my God! Mostly, Hollywood seems to have run out of original storylines and is making all of these remakes.",-0.5562,75

"So just finished watching all seasons and I have to say this series is starting to get on my nerves, the constant flip flopping in these people is so annoying, person A starts doubting then leaves then comes back and is the biggest believer of all then loses his/her belief again and leaves then comes back again and becomes leader this happens to person B,C,D,E etc etc too. Just sigh! This show has a bunch of shitty writers who love to rehash and write the same shit over and over I feel like I am watching a damn soap where everyone gets around dating each other eventually.",-0.8997,120

This is such a very good show...,0.4927,8
"This show is AMAZING! I didn't know about it until 3 weeks ago when I watched every episode in the first two seasons back-to-back with scarcely time in between them each to sleep. I am absolutely RIVETED! I can't wait to see the new season although it will be painful to watch only one show per week when I'll wish I could watch them all at once! I especially love Cal - Hugh - who is this man?? I think he's the most gifted actor I've ever experienced!  He makes me weep he's so phenomenal!! And Sarah Lane -Michelle - is fantastic too! Well all of them are extraordinary, as must be the writer/s and director/s! But Cal -Hugh - has totally stolen my heart. The two hopes I have for the 3rd season is that the Dr. Stephen Meyer character will be outed for molesting Cal, and that Hawk will realize he loves Ashley instead of giving his attention to Noa. Amy Forsyth is also sooo beautiful and her acting melts my heart. The one change I hope Eddie Lane makes to Meyerism is that it's just fine if members fall in love with people outside the movement, and that if they do they won't be labeled as deniers and kicked out.  Anyway, sorry this is so long! The Path is brilliant!!!",0.9825,253
