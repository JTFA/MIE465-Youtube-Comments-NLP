"@Alex Howard when it comes to your music gear, try not to make temporary investments if possible. Save up and invest in something that will last you years as opposed to months.
it will save you money in the long run, and it always helps to be working with something more integrated to the DAW that you have. 
Also if you cant afford a brand new one, they sell used much cheaper, and the first one sells at about half the cost(these are other alternatives to be considered).
Buuuut if you are really bent on doing it your way, the launch pad, the midi fighter 3d, and the MPD 218 are all much more (intitially) cost effective choices. Youll be missing all of the easy integration and the LED displays but you can definitely make a drum rack and use one of those to launc/play your samples.
Good luck

i seriously recommend Push tho, if you finding yourself thinking about it;)",0.9658,183

For this reason , having a roughened edge to the sound of something that otherwise sounds like a call of organic origin makes an unconscious part of our brain fire off that gives us a quick alerts to danger.",-0.9153,130

"Jesse engel, I understand that that's what it's doing ""under the hood"" but the end result is amplitude changes over time at multiple speeds, one speed being sample rate, and the other being ADSR. that's an inevitable consequence of looking at data in a per-sample rate way. The result is that it learns complex wave shapes from the training data, and changes to those wave shapes over time, also from the training data, with no comprehension of how it sounds. It's just numbers. From an output audio perspective though, for how it sounds, that's indistinguishable from learning the fourier transforms and morphing between them almost like a wavetable, and controlling the volume.... sort of like datamoshing video, but for sound.

Don't get me wrong though, it's damned impressive from a technical level that it works at all, much less as well as it does, but as far as making cool sounds, It's a bit like inventing NASA and the lunar lander, to launch yourself into space, fly around for a few hours, to land your lander a few blocks away at the 7-11 to get a bag of chips and a 2-liter, and then do it all over again to get home. it's technically impressive, fun to watch how it happened, but at the end of the day, you still just went to get a bag of chips and a 2-liter. it's like a digital Rube Goldberg machine. 

my comments on how I would set it up personally, are not from a ""this is more technically impressive"" standpoint, but rather a ""I think this would yield more interesting sounds"" standpoint. also, I only see ONE reason to look at audio data as samples, using a neural network for recognition, and that's to detect digital stenography very quickly. I don't see it being practical for any other purpose, because just about every other use we have for audio recordings, fourier analysis is more practical. It yields consistent results and is probably less processor intensive to generate. I could be wrong on that part though, I'm no computer scientist. I also wonder why image recognition neural networks are fed raster images instead of vector for that same reason. I just assume the data would process faster.",0.9878,429
