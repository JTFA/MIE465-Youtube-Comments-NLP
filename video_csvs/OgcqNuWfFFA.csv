"I'm not trying to take a crap on you guys as I know it's HARD AF to succeed in anything, but I never really felt like you guys were BURIED in it. I've been involved with much smaller startups and god it just about killed us. Casey was flying around doing a bunch of other stuff that wasn't Beme related I was like...""how does he have time for this?"". I don't know the details of the contract but it feels to me like it was never really BROUGHT. 

That said, learning from failure is a big thing, you guys are all young and probably not accustomed to working on things that are actually BIGGER than yourselves so hopefully you can apply what you learn down the road. 

Jacks' channel...happy he's got this opportunity, although i've seen some really great creators grinding their assess off all year for  less subs than he got in 2 days lol. The SHOUTOUT works no doubt.

"JAKE - I had the same thing but only for around 3 months.. when I started thinking i was going to die, my chest was hurting, went to the hospital and they said I was fine.. 2 days later my sister calls and tells me my mom has suffered a heart attack.. (She's doing great now!) but that really got to me and I was getting average 2 hours asleep while I monitored my heart rate yadda yadda..
I decided the only way to get over it would be to get over it.. so knuckled down, grinding on youtube, work and another project.. lifes good now but my biggest fear is that feeling is going to come back..

Long ass comment, and I'm fine right now, when I heard that bit of your video the reassurance was insane.. Idk if you had anything like me or an actual illness but yea, first time I've felt completely relatable to a youtuber! 

Thank you! Good luck and hey, I'm a new subscriberrrrr",0.5463,191
"Jake Roper 
Thank you for sharing that.
I empathize with you... At age 18 I was told that I had a spinal tumor, but I found out at age 38 that I did not have a spinal tumor. I spent 20 years of my life recklessly living, thinking I was about to die... And then found out that I wasn't about to die. I don't think people fully appreciate the level of mental change that occurs when you understand that your life is shorter than everyone else's. It is both liberating and terrifying. I just want you to know that you are one of my favorite human beings on the planet. I'm glad you're going to be able to push further than you thought you would.
