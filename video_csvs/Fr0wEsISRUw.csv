".Good video, but - you NEED to reduce the (cheerful) background music volume by 90% (or remove it completely).

The background music added to most (all) videos - is usually way TOO loud. If it is noticed - then it's irritating, distracting and generally offers no helpful purpose.

For this particular video - if you want to (quietly) back-sell the theme of danger and dread - maybe use something similar to the opening movie sound track - of ""Jaws""..

"The Edward Snowden app

This might work for some situations.

Local Law enforcement
DEA
Private Investigators
Some divisions of
the 
CIA
FBI
NSA


But it will not make an effect on the really good units.

First you must examine a combination of
warrant-less surveillance footage 
and
break and enters.


The actual act of breaking into someones property to snoop
for information is illegal.

Thus no paper records or government accountability is left
to reveal full methods and capabilities.

No rules are followed.

Special units are created for this purpose that on paper do not exist and thus
can never fully be researched or reviewed. 

First the surveillance victim is followed and their routines are documented.

Then detailed pictures are taken of their door locks.

Then the type of lock to their room or home is researched in detail.

Then mock locks and keys are made and tested to ensure access is made to their property.

Then a dry run is made were the keys are tested on the property but no entry is made. 

The  surveillance victim is followed and a time is chosen that allows as much time as possible for the illegal
search to happen while they are away.

A team of 2-5 people is usually who does the break and enter and search.

These people have backgrounds in
locksmith
home renovations
cleaning services
forensic crime scene investigation
electronic specialists
computer specialists
private investigations
espionage specialist

This team makes entry with a working house key pre-made. 

They wear plastic jump suits and plastic footsies
with shoes that have no tread to prevent scuffs or footprints.

The first thing they do is take detailed pictures of the room and every object as soon as they enter the room.

This is so that they can backtrack their steps replacing every object as it was originally found when they first entered.

They take detailed photos of all drawers and dressers as well allowing objects to be placed perfectly.

The subject is monitored while they are away and this is going on. If they return home suddenly radio calls are given
in advanced to pull the team out.

There are secondary teams on standby to remove the team or fix damages if the break anything before the target
returns home so they do not find anyone in the place snooping or any broken things.

If any automated security systems are in place such as surveillance footage or electronic or internet
trip wire devices. These are detected ahead of time. Their electronic or digital signal is rerouted via a splice
to a fake network. Fake or older video footage or security footage is transmitted in its place.

Example if a person has a digital security camera system with an automated sensor that
takes photos and emails.

The team will reroute the email network, and camera network.

So the alarm emails do not get received and so old fake footage is re-recorded or re-re transmitted.


Once they have this system in place of about 15-20 of the worlds best spies. 

They create teams and build mock rooms, houses, offices that the surveillance target lives in or works out of.

This allows teams to train in mock or replica environments to become faster.

The training team will rotate on and off with the on duty team.

This creates for an environment in which a person is surrounded by 20-100 modern day
ninjas that can monitor everything in their home and network and computer with out them
being able to do anything about it.",-0.966,625

"Why figure out how to sneak spyware onto people's devices when you can get them to do it for you willingly in the name of fighting exactly the sort of bullshit you're trying to push?

Edward Snowden is only a credible voice against autocracy if the only thing you know about him is that he leaked NSA documents ostensibly to shine light on domestic spying in the US. Unfortunately, that's a problem a lot of Americans will run into... being so blinded by their anger at our own government (well-founded though much of that anger may be) that they don't think through Snowden's motivations. He's not a crusader against secrecy and autocracy. He's a low-ranking former NSA contractor who was pissed off he wasn't being recognized for his self-proclaimed talents and now has an axe to grind, not against secrecy or autocracy, but simply against his former employers.

How can we know this? Why is this not just idle speculation, or conspiracy mongering, or an effort to discredit a threat to the ongoing US hegemony, or whatever? We can know it because Snowden fled to the protection of Mother Russia, of all places, and his buddy Glen Greenwald shills for Russia on his website all the time.
