"After watching this I had to do some research. Google the Washington Post article about Eddie &Edith and you will get more details as to why the daughter in Virginia was rejected as a guardian.  Everything isn‚Äôt as cut and dry as the documentary made it seem. There was a 3rd daughter that had guardianship that wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the film but she gave up her rights because everything started getting overwhelming (she at that time was 77 herself).  The decision to move Edith had a lot to do with the condition or lack thereof, of her home. With that said there was failure on the part of the family for not making sure Edith‚Äôs affairs were in order. As far as Eddie, I‚Äôd like to know where his people were? Did he at least have kids? All  I have to say is people need to do better when it comes to caring for aging parents. Folks act like they are going to stay young forever. You reap what you sow!",0.5802,195

And when she said she had never even met Edith I got even angrier.  She's supposed to look after Edith's interests.  How could she and never have met or spoken to her?  Did Edith not even have a right to a competency hearing?  
The elderly don't seem to have any more rights than children.  And the daughter...what was her name...Pam or Patricia?  If it's within Edith's power,  she should make sure that daughter didn't inherit so much as a nickel.  How greedy and self-serving can you get. Her mother was 96 years old.  Why couldn't she leave her alone and let her be happy.  If she truly wanted to help why couldn't she hire a home attendant so her mother could stay in her own home.

How many husbands and wives die shortly after losing their partner! Unfortunately, children bicker and fight more over what they think is owed to them; rather than to rejoice and thank God, the mother who raised them is still here! Make her Happy, love her, Honor Her! There is NO HONOR , in forcing your parents to become Your children!!! Sad sad sad.    How can a daughter do this to her mother! Greed! And for another woman to be put in charge of an elderly woman she has never met, is awful. The daughter wanted control over the money, Jessica just got paid for doing nothing! EDITH said in the video ""Love, was to treat everybody right""! Jessica nor the daughter from Florida, had ""NO"" respect for what Ms Edith wanted!

She was a blessing to her mother and step father.   They were so beautiful together.  Shame on the judge to appoint a stranger over her life and finances without  requiring Jessica to spend time with her client to find out the truth.

This story is truly sad especially Edith daughter who is wicked to keep her own mother apart from her husband. Bless eddies heart and May he Rest In Peace üôèüèæ,0.4019,32
"This was a beautiful story of love deep in two individuals heart! Jessica you are exactly what Eddie said! An evil woman! You seem to have only cared about getting paid from Ediths estate and not caring for her as a human being. Karma and God's vengeance will come back around for you!! Rest in peace dear Eddie, your Edith will return to you and no one will be able to take her from you again. God bless you both!",0.9305,89
This was a painful watch. The abuse of the elderly should be a crime.,-0.891,16
This was beautiful and sad at the same time Jessica will pay for what you done ro your mother. She could have stayed home with her husband and lived out both their lives together RIP EDDIE!!,0.2462,39
This was so heart breaking. Oh my!,0.0,9
This was so profoundly beautiful and sad at the same time. You could tell what was going to happen after separating them. Their love stabilized each other. The misuse of authority was appalling. Things could have been handled far better. Remember Eddie's last  words to the guardian.,0.7893,53

"Typical soulless bureaucratic interference.  Poor souls were happy together.  So let‚Äôs get strangers involved who, for some reason, are on the side of the sister who supposedly has her mother‚Äôs best interests at heart.  I can‚Äôt see how ripping apart this happy couple helps Edith. It definitely was the end of Eddie.",0.9413,65
Unbelievable!! Shocking that they actually took her out the home she worked so hard for against her will and left her love like they have no rights. They need protection from that witch!!,0.3403,38
Unreal unprofessional how does she have no rights no free will she is in the right state of mind,-0.5267,19
"WOW!  This is so HORRIBLE what these demons did to them & I am crying REAL TEARS as I lie here in bed watching this.  OMG!  This is SO EVIL & so abusive!  This hurt me so DEEPLY inside & I cry HARD & intensely for them.  My God!!!  They were already old, almost out of here & they weren't harming anybody but the GREEDY & EVIL devil.  They should've been allowed to spend their remaining years together.  This was SO hateful & lowdown & I wish I hadn't watched it because it hurts me SO BAD & I grieve terribly for Eddith & Eddie right now!!!  The beautiful love between these two, Edith & Eddie, is so sweet & should not have been tampered with or interfered with.  May Almighty God deal swiftly & justly with that AWFULLLLLL demon who is trying to separate them & may no good come to that demon who is trying to separate them.  Amen.  üò¢",-0.9925,181
"We all better get a will and set our affairs in order. I knew one or both would die without the other. Pure evil, that Pat, Jessica was just doing her job but I still don't agree, but God will repay.",-0.7956,47
"We need to continue to share Edith and Eddie‚Äôs story so that people know about persons like Jessica, who stand behind their job.  It was disgusting to watch the inhumanity and hear of the greed.",-0.34,40
"What a lovely elderly couple who decided to get married, something that most young people take for granted nowadays.  Yes, it is heartfelt to the point of heartbreaking to know that someone such as Liberal (hatred for the man)Jessica and Pam could be so cruel to separate them based on money. Jessica has a double-sided tongue which makes her a liar,  one side she wanted to reason and then on the other side, she gave them a sucker punch to say you have to leave because we don't want to miss your flight. In the meantime, Eddie called Jessica out, ""you have the devil underneath your bed"" says Eddie. When Edith said that she has her right mind, there is nothing wrong with my mind. Jessica should have let it be. Jessica overrides the will of a husband for his wife and that is unethical and unconstitutional as his alienate rights. 
I am highly frustrated with the mistreatment of the elderly, the court ruled in her favor because of dementia.  How does her daughter Pam know this to be medically correct? If it isn't broken then don't fix it. May God be merciful to all hands that was involved in separating this union.",-0.7923,227
"What a situation...what an evil person! She keeps telling her she‚Äôs afraid to go because of the abuse and this b#^*h just ignores her and still talking about.. ok, i know, but come on we‚Äôre going to miss our flight!!

"Wow just wow a modern day Romeo and Juliet! Although dying of a broken heart is a lot worse that poison and a dagger to me. This story shows how Love is the strongest thing in this universe. Instead of focusing on Jessica (she'll get hers 10 fold) focus on how true love, even for a moment is the greatest thing we can experience in life.",0.9551,73

"Wtf, why are they treating Edith like she‚Äôs a baby, she grown and can make her own decisions and I understand that she has some illnesses but that doesn‚Äôt give you the right to break them apart...they love each other. They could of at least let him come with Edith, but money hungry people don‚Äôt care about anyone else but themselves.",0.8537,74

its sad that Patricia snatched her mother from Rebecca. For money. No regard for her health or happiness. they would have to put me under the jail before I watch my mother be dragged away to an abusive home. Broke everyone's heart who cared about her. Of course that excludes Jessica and Patrcia's husband. this is too much,-0.7269,64

God is not mocked, what you sow Jessica you WILL reap.  why is this not manslaughter???????  my heart is broken for Edith.  I am praying for you Edith, you need to be with your Eddie where ageing does not exist.  How different can two sisters be? - one with selfless love for her mother and the other with no love for her mother...........one with a beautiful heart and the other with no heart.........too, too sad.  sending  heartfelt love Edith to you and to the daughter and grand-daughter who fought their hardest for you......peace of Jesus be with you.",0.7801,161

im sure theres 2 sides, but you just dont fly at 95 unless its your choice, why not fly her to timbuctoo, or india, or siberia?...cuz it is ridiculous, and so is florida. ( and they tell Edith its a little vacay?....there wasnt no reasoning to the trip....",-0.6975,110
