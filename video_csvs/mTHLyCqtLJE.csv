"All four of your dogs are so adorable but I have to say something.. I think a lot of their snoring is because they are purebred Shih Tzus. Dogs that are bred to have those cute, squished-in faces (Shih Tzus, Pugs, Chows, Mastiffs) have to suffer because their noses and heads are unnaturally short (it's called brachycephalic). Their airways are narrow and obstructed and it causes them to make snoring/ snorting noises. Purebred dogs tend to have more health problems because they have less genetic variation and more recessive genes. Not trying to criticize anyone who has a purebred dog but I think it's something people should be aware of. There are dog breeders out there who genetically test their dogs before breeding to make sure their puppies won't inherit genetic issues like this, but most breeders don't.",-0.0924,155

I just discovered you on Youtube. I am a new subscriber. I think you are great and give great reviews. I was wondering if you could recommend some products for people who have allergy issues. I have EXTREMELY sensitive eyes and try to look for hypoallergenic products. The problem is, there is only a handful of product lines which make hypoallergenic products. I wonder about trying new products, but I'm hesitant because I don't know if they will irritate my eyes or not. I prefer the drugstore/walmart brands because I can afford their prices. Can you recommend some products that would be safe for sensitive eyes like mine. I'm sure there are other subscribers that have the same problem I do. Thanks so much!",0.9134,141

I have thick, mind of its own frizzy hair. but with this it tames all that and gives me the confidence to wear my natural hair which I never do because it always seems to look like a lions mane without heat. So thats my input that may or may not get lost in all these comments. But definitely look up MONAT combined from the words ""modern nature""!",0.9731,113
