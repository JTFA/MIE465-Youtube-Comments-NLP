"Angelica Licari and I'm sorry but I hate it when people make everything about Alex. There were countless people on the internet dismissing how traumatizing it must be for Jo to see Paul appear out of nowhere because they were scared Alex could kill the kid now. And they all blamed Jo for freezing up instead of keep running. In the promo you can see Alex sitting by Jo's side probably holding her hand. I think the boy is going to be fine for whatever reason, because now is really not the time to add a storyline about Alex's distress about killing a patient when the woman he loves is facing her worst nightmare. Some other time, yes. Would make a great storyline probably, but not now. They already made Jo's storyline, that should've happened last season, about Alex by doing the whole trial with Deluca thing which lasted half a season. This time the storyline is finally about the person it should've been in the first place about. And yes I actually love Alex, but sometimes people really annoy me making everything about him.",-0.9603,201

"CheesyMeat I think it does mess with her Contract with Grey's. But Idk how she was able to make 2 Tomb Raider videogames and do Grey's at the same time since she has to ACT in a motion capture costume to MAKE the games! She must of done the games first before she was on Grey's.

I think if she was killed off of the show she'd be able to make the movie! I prefer her because of her voice. I LOVE hearing her voice in the games! It's like she's the REAL Lara Croft we've been looking for! 

Imagine Square Cnix hires Alicia Vikander to be the next Lara Croft in the next game? I'd be pissed! 

I guess when you're in a TV show you're basically stuck with it, so there's no way she could of make a Tomb Raider movie and be in a show at the same time. But then again, I hope she'll make a 3rd one to make the Tomb Raider videogame series reboot awesome! I love Camilla Luddington more TBH.",0.693,191
