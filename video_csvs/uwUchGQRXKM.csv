"Hey Desi! I had an idea for a video that I'd love to see and immediately thought of you! I think it would be awesome to do a video (or couple of videos) that were ""Your look... but better"". Have people bring their products and show the way they use them, then you could show them how to step up their game. Whether it be a better brow technique, toning down the highlight, using a better primer for their skin type, or actually finding the right foundation color. It could a get-out-the-door look, a casual everyday look, to full glam. Have an ""expert"" (aka you) show a ""novice"" (aka us) how it can be done a little better. Thanks, love your vids 💕",0.9859,150

"Since you also like fashion, maybe instead of totally new eye looks that nobody can wear, maybe do tutorials where you can make tutorials on how to pair makeup with outfits? Like, here's a trendy piece of clothing or style that everybody is wearing, what can you put on your face to match that? You can get guests with different face shapes or skin tones and personal aesthetics, and you can teach us, like, hey since her eyes are like this shape or because her jaws are like this, we'll do her makeup differently from how you usually do it on your own face. Something like that? Or maybe a gem and metals series. So every week, a different look depending on a different kind of crystal. Like rose quartz with rose gold. Or sapphire and silver. Opalite.
