Also instead of having smooth bottom skis they have ridges that help them grip on to the snow. The ridges go across the width of the ski and are in a shape that lets them glide forward without much stopping them and when pulled back they dig into the snow propelling you forward.,0.4843,55

Dear Friends did you know that Jesus Christ has a perfect plan for your life? But it is up to you to allow Him to come into your life. He won't force you. He must always be invited. It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your trust in Him so that He may lead you and guide you throughout your whole life on earth and also prepare you for the glorious and wonderful day when you receive your great reward in Heaven. He so eagerly wants you to come to this realization dear one. He truly does. Make today your starting point with our loving Creator that will last forever. May God bless you in the MIGHTY name of Jesus Christ our Savior. ❤️❤️❤️  (2 Timothy 4:8;  Ephesians 2:6;  1 Peter 5:4;  Luke 6:23;  John 3:16;  John 14:3),0.9949,172

In the competitive racing world like the Olympics and the world cup ski racing wax is only a small portion of this all. It depends even more on a skiers edges. A metal edge on the side of a skis base. This is used to carve into the ice and accelerate the skier faster than the base would because of even less friction. And bases aren't just a right and piece of metal. They can be sharpened down to a degree to affect what angle they carve the snow at.,0.4939,96

I was very fortunate to have an amazing tech, Kris who always did the homework for me to ensure my skis were ready for the day's race. Sadly he passed away from skin cancer a few years ago. Truth is while the correct decision on wax selection can make or break a race - it's those dedicated techs, coaches, and trainers that get us across that finish line first ... but most importantly - my amazing parents who were up with me at the crack of dawn for over fifteen years getting me to and from the mountain nearly every day from the moment the snow fell to the last spring thaw.

"Not bad as a quick primer on flouro vs. hydrocarbon ski waxes.  The main part you left out is electrostatic friction.  Colder, drier snow creates static cling to the ski base as it slides over.  You can see it when you pick up your ski and there are snow crystals sticking to your base.  Waxes with graphite or molybdenum added are used to combat this effect and race ski bases are usually made with graphite in the base material (that's why they are black).  Bill Johnson took advantage of this effect to win the 1984 Olympic DH in Sarajevo as he had the only pair of skis in the race with black electrographite bases.",0.25,124

The tips and tails of the ski have the same glide wax as alpine, so when you're in your glide and there is less weight on the ski, just those sections make contact with the snow. Kick wax will stick forward or backward, but based on your motions it shouldn't have the opportunity to stick when that ski is gliding forward",-0.4585,127
