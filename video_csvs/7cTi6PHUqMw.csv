Cavill and Affleck look like extreme cosplay portrayals and Eisenberg's Luthor Jr spazz attacks would have been too incoherent and over the top, for both the Joker and the Riddler from the 60's Batman series. Also Green Lantern happened, matter how much, they attempt to wish it out of existence. Please stick to the animated movies DC, it's what you're good at, Marvel is coasting to Infinity War, meanwhile DC is self destructing right before our eyes. They don't have a fully  intact universe, only a black hole.

Forgot to mention, The main reason the  Wonder Woman film was so good, besides Gadot, and Pine is because it was basically a DC reboot of the Chris Evans Captain America. No shame in that, because it worked.",0.57,207

You have to be a bit mental to do that.  As for this DCEU vs Marvel debate that rages on daily on this talkback.  Shouldn't true comic book fans like both properties?.  Wouldn't it be better if both companies were producing great films? it would not only be a win-win but each company would strive to make the best product as the bar would be set higher.  Federer vs Nadal, Yankees vs Red Sox, Celtics vs Lakers to use just a couple sporting references.  John!! you have total control of the content you want to talk about.  Maybe talking about JL every day is something you enjoy doing, but come on, change the record once in a while.  Leave some of the comic book talk to your old pal Jon Schnepp over at Collider :P.

The tone of the movie was all over the place., you could easily tell the Joss scenes from the Zynder and it didn't mix at all. I would put steppenwolf as one of the worst villains of all time. He was a CG character who you had no idea what he was on about with bad CG fight scenes and no character development whatsoever. WB should have just gave the solo films first, was completely rushed cyborg, flash and aquaman. Critics didn't solely kill JL the audiences have had enough of the mediocre of DC I'm afraid.

I'd say yes but not place all the blame for Justice League fully on critics. With BvS & Suicide Squad fans mostly ignored the critics with those movies having Huge box office weekends. The dip BvS & SS took the following weeks was due to bad word of mouth. This time a lot of fans seem to listen to critics despite the movie being better than BvS & SS. However had those 2 movies not burned a lot of general audience fans then the bad reviews of critics never would've had the opportunity to affect Justice League.,-0.9339,102

"I've been thinking recently about the Marvel Studios and DCEU movies, and one thing I much prefer about the Marvel films is that, when you watch one, it feels like a complete experience. It feels like a well rounded film with weight, the DCEU films feel like a few chapters from a comic book. There's so much set-up for future things that don't tie into the narrative, and the set-up can be confusing, or as the story being told feels like a few chapters as opposed to a comic book annual (like Marvel), the characters aren't given much development so that they don't feel like they've evolved much, making them feel like they have less weight.

The good movies in the DCEU, in my mind, and the ones actually most well received too - Man of Steel and Wonder Woman - felt like complete experiences, like comic book annuals as opposed to a few chapters, character arcs were well realised for multiple characters and there was no focus on set-up for future things, allowing the films time to focus on the important elements that make a movie itself be good. Batman v. Superman and Justice League felt like a few chapters from a comic, Suicide Squad felt like that to a lesser extent - some characters were given arcs and the story didn't focus on set-ups, but it acted like a few chapters from a comic midway through its run, as we were introduced to a lot of characters in a short space of time the movie acted like we should know, as Amanda Waller quickly explained them to us. It would've been much better if there were fewer characters, like Guardians of the Galaxy, allowing everyone time to shine. Instead, it felt like only a few characters had time to develop, and they were developed poorly, not aided by a muddled, messy plot.",0.9834,347
"Iconic has nothing to do with it.  It's about good movie making.  DC thought iconic was all you needed, and that's why they failed.  And by the way, you're confusing the word iconic with anybody caring.  Ronald Mcdonald is iconic.  People care about the Avengers.  There's a difference, and the difference is good writing, character word, planning and execution.  DC has none of those.",0.7906,77

"In defense of the lighter Batman, there was significant progression in the character of Batman at the start of Justice League in comparison to BvS. In BvS he's grizzled, more damaged than he already was and in a dark place because he presumably lost a Robin.

Still would have preferred a bit darker, but I think they had a valid reason for the lighter stuff.",0.6314,94

"It does have something to do with it though. I never said making a good movie wasn't important. Obviously that is the most important factor. If you make a bad movie its not going to do as well no matter what property it is. However, are you aware that Batman vs Superman initially sold on name alone? That movie had the biggest opening weekend for any comic book movie ever. Why do you think that is?  I can tell you why. Its because those are the biggest two superheroes of all time. DC absolutely could have made it work without using the same formula as marvel. The Justice League movie that we got just needed to be longer and needed to be written differently for it be more effective.  The idea that you ""have"" to do solo films before the big team up ensemble film is the product of the marvel mentality that has been so ingrained in peoples heads over the last 10 years. Prior to the MCU, that wasn't even a thing. Everyone just thought that we would get a Justice League movie. No build up. Just...a justice league movie. 10-15 years ago, nobody would have questioned it. But now we live in an era where marvel has established what is generally considered to be the norm in terms of how to go about making comic book movies. And now, the typical notion is that if you deviate from that formula, you are wrong and will not be successful. Maybe it would have been better if DC had done what marvel did, and maybe the fact that they did not is the reason why JL will not receive the same kind of mainstream mass appeal that the Avengers had. I promise you though, that was not their main issue. They could have been extremely successful. However, the primary reason for DC's lack of success has been the controversial story telling, character portrayals, and creative decisions made in these films.",0.9173,368

People do take critics reviews seriously especially in today's climate with social media being such a huge impact on things, I believe your 10% figure is way off and may have been an old estimate from years ago. Nowadays hype and Word of Mouth mean more than anything. The fan ratings show how much people like it... It is critics on TV and social media that have attacked the movie and said all kinds of horrible things about it. Even my neighbor and Dad who are in their fifties and sixties were  saying how Ben Affleck just mailed in his performance which I didn't get the impression of that at all in the movie. Seems to me he did just as good as he did in BvS. I believe JL would have made at least another 25 million or more had it not been for the critical reviews that it received.",-0.8664,215

To illustrate: That's showing up after the builders have laid out the foundation that YOU AGREED ON...and saying, ""Hey I changed my mind, why don't we make it smaller?""  It's stupid, it's destructive, and it costs everyone money.  SEE: Fantastic 4.

I get collaboration and cooperation.  This was neither.  This was derailment--over and over.  It screwed up BvS theatrical cut, and it screwed up Suicide Squad.  It's the old definition of insanity, making the same mistake over and over, expecting different results.

"Okay, fair enough. But you've highlighted another issue I have with this whole fiasco.

Like you, I loved Man of Steel. However, I strongly believe the reason it was so divisive is because fans didn't know what they wanted. And I know that sounds pretentious, but hear me out...

I've talked to a lot of people, and from what I can gather most of those who didn't like MoS are people who basically wanted to see Christopher Reeve's Superman back on the big screen. But if they tried to do that, the movie would have inevitably been slammed for not being able to recapture the magic (because that's how nostalgia works), and also for being unoriginal. So they gave us a brand new interpretation of the character, but people then got upset because they wanted the old story retold.

So it was a lose-lose situation. There was simply no way MoS was going to please everybody, but imo Snyder did a fantastic job of pleasing *some* people. Those who didn't like this version suddenly started objecting to everything he did.

I also liked BvS, but it definitely had issues. Yet I suspect a lot of this was also caused by studio interference. *They* wanted to quickly expand their universe, so they kinda forced Snyder's hand (away from a MoS 2). So, how else do you re-introduce Batman straight after the Nolan trilogy? Again, Snyder had to take a huge risk... And then he had to chop his movie down for a theatrical cut that didn't sit well with audiences.

As to Justice League, very few people even have a clue where Snyder was going because the studio kept changing the rules every other month. This is why Ben left, because they took his darker script and direction away from him. The final version we saw was like a complete mockery of Snyder's original vision.

Anyway, what do you think WB should do now? They surely cannot recast people like Gal Gadot; she is almost universally loved. Ironically, it now puts them in the same predicament Snyder was in; you can't reboot without pissing off all the new fans of WW who won't accept anything other than *this* WW.",0.9737,420

Superado2006 also saying there is more to blame on critics does not add up. Where are you getting that belief?

Superado2006 no offense but your  information is anecdotal at best. Speaking to a few hundred people does not figure into a figure larger than 10%. 10% of the movie was about 10 million dollars or roughly 2 million people. How can you EVEN begin to use anecdotal evidence to convince yourself that your numbers are larger than that of what Campea said while he spoke to someone who works in the business and had annaylist doing the figures for them?,0.802,87
Superado2006 that's fine. But I'm a sociologist and anecdotal evidence will never and should never be taken into account. His defense comes from the industry and companies they work for. Having even a few hundred people tell you different does not equal it. You can't just argue his point and say it's moot because of a few people you have given lyfts to.

"That's fair.  And I agree.  I don't know what their plans are, but this film is now projected to lose around $100 million dollars.  They aren't going to just keep making movies that aren't profitable, so there will be changes.  And when I say, making excuses, I don't mean that some people enjoyed it, but it's time to recognize that saying you enjoyed it doesn't mean anything.  Clearly the vast majority don't.  It's simply not good enough, and whether it's Jason Mamoa saying they're doing it for the fans or the Fans claiming critics are against them, it's time to put away the excuses and deal with how to improve a franchise that has obviously failed.",-0.5796,131

Between schedule conflicts, getting my friends on the same page, and having the money to spend, I'm going to be able to see one movie every six weeks or so.  Do I go see Thor: Ragnarok or JL?  Well, so far, I've never gone to a Marvel movie and thought that I had wasted my money.  On the other hand, I've seen three DCEU movies: one was great (Wonder Woman), one was mediocre (Man of Steel), and one was flat out incoherent and disappointing (BvS).  So, which one do I go to see?  That answer is obvious.

Now, in a few weeks, The Last Jedi is going to be the next movie I pay to see in a theatre.  JL is going to be a Redbox watch.

Don't insult your audience.  First, make a good movie.  Then, figure out a coherent reason to have it connected with the next.  Finally, make a second good movie and make the connection work within the confines of the universe you're trying to build.  Warner Bros. (and Universal) thought the connected universe is the draw.  In all of those meetings, they forgot to make good movies. JL is failing because BvS was bad.

You are totally on point about JL. Snyder's style is not for everyone and BvS + Suicide Squad made JL a fan only movie. I love DC characters but I hate Snyder's fascist vision. I don't like any of the movies he's directed for the DCEU.
Your are just like George Lucas: ""People want to see what the movie is about"". Wrong, maybe on the past when there was no Internet or social media. I hate trailers for revealing too much.

provide a bed. don´t some actors make more than oil rig workers? for shame. sunshine cost 50 mil right? this manson movie should cost 30 mil at most. if 
you´re a clever and good enough film maker you could make it way below that i think. like 10 mil or lower but i could be wrong. it´s a period thing. maby the 
more money the lazier it feels with movies. really everyone on movies should get a lower pay upfront and all share in the back end. maby better results in 
the end?

jl suffered more from bad marketing and all the problems behind the scenes plus the cgi in the trailer looked bad. had all that been better 
then more would´ve seen it. but now we find out that the story and villain is weak too so... this whole thing has just put me off of the dc 
movie verse. i´m grateful for the tv shows. but even if they´re doing great they´re not allowed batman, aquaman, green lanter. f#¤% wb. i 
thought bvs extended was ok. still thought the fight could have had a better conclusion and luthor wasn't good. maby it´s the cgi? or the 
emptiness? or perhaps like a dull gery feeling that i don´t like about the dc movie verse? i have no problems with the tv shows... i don´t know.

did you pay for the tickets yourself all 5 times or just a few?

 i´m a fan of good movies and shows. not rush jobs like jl.

were one of them that kevin smith and marc bernardin should take over dc at wb?

don´t know anything about ready player 1 apart from the trailer. looks like a lot of cgi to me :(. fun to see some nostalgic stuff though.
thought spielberg built s#¤% for his movies.

if they make a smaller jurassic world like jurassic park and maby it´s about getting all the animals under control? less cgi.

if ben had done a stand alone batman it could have rivaled wonder woman or done better. just saying wb, you f#¤%d up.

if it´s not finnished push the release date! do not release a thing that´s not finnished! your spitting in our faces when doing so because you 
show us that you don´t give a flying f#¤% about the things we love! i hate wb! i´m glad they lost money on this s#¤% fest. how could anyone
like a half assed project!? if it has as many flaws as everyone say´s it has it sucks!

maby even 3 story lines? 1 rey, luke and chewie. 2 finn and rose. 3 poe and leia? kylo could touch on all?

wb tried to hide the reviwes because jl sucked, is it corrupt behaviour?

i liked the spartacus show. deadwood was good don´t know if it was underrated though. but it sucks untill the movie is done to conclude it all.

Natalie Portman is wonderful. Both amazing actresses. I followed them to their movies in comics. McAvoy Jlaw and Fassbender are all awesome. I continued to be fan of Xmen. 
Sorry, there I go with my psycho rabble again. 
All kinds of bloggers seem to just breathe hate on everything. It makes no sense. Siskel and Ebert were fans of movies. Like them or not. They did more then criticize movies. They reviewed them. And they were fair. 
The kinds of atmosphere in cinema today is just hate. I don't get it. If that's how they pay their bills? Fine. 
Schnepp and Rob are comic fans. And they were bashing dc every chance they had. DC kept getting up. 
And now that justice is on the mat? They looked like shocked at themselves. Cause they know they did very little to protect something they love, which is comics. It was interesting to see that self realization in their faces. It was not them personally. But they are part of a machine in this new world of internet capitalism. I don't listen to their opinions on movies. But they know all kinds of shit about comics. They always teach me about characters, stories, history in comics. Its useful for me.

I like Snyder. I liked his creative vision in movies. It looks like he will move on. And I will continue to be a fan of his. 
I liked Johansson and Portman. They are both artistic genius. It looks like comic movies will push them aside. I will follow them and continue to be fans of their acting. It feels like all of the things that brought me into comic movies are the things that bloggers hate. That's unfortunate. I will continue to watch Xmen. New Mutants and the dark Phoenix look great. They will get my money ten times over.

nytolstoy let's wait and see. The movie seem to be made for children and those are people who can keep coming back.,0.0,24
"nytolstoy no survey ever includes every person, they are all sample groups and base their numbers on that percentage. So I still stick by my earlier response. Furthermore you don't know how long ago he was told that information and if it is still relevant and accurate today. Furthermore, you can't generalize every movie and every scenario into one round figure that equates to every single movie and every single situation. Why I will agree that there are other circumstances and situations that have impacted the box office for this movie, there is much more blame on the critics then Campea is suggesting. Sorry, but if you agree with him, we will have to agree to disagree.",0.1664,128
"nytolstoy that's fair enough. I know this is your world. So when anyone disagrees with me, I just kinda shrug. If anyone tries to insult me? I just laugh. Cause I'm a grown man, this is the internet, I don't see the point to hurl insults at other fans, nor do I enjoy it. Mostly i like to do my debates in person. On a barstool. Drinking a pint. Vs complete strangers. That's where I blow off my steam. Heh. 
Yeah you're into comics. This is your realm. I think it's perfectly normal for fans to feel outrage. But for bloggers? Who speak to hundreds of thousands of fans everyday? The rules are different for them. They got to be the voice of reason for us. They got to be a professional. 
As for Zach Snyder? If he really didn't belong here? So be it. 
If dc is gonna the way where no one dies? Well, those movies don't interest me. I'm sure my daughter will love them. But they don't interest me. 
Cause if I was standing in front of a man who was responsible for killing my mom? (Winter soldier) I would kill him. For sure. And that fight sequence just looked weak. Stark could done it. Totally. 
At the very least. When roadie fell? I woulda shot falcon in the face. 
Batman was shooting guys. He crushed so many guys in his fights. Super killed zod. That is all so wicked and vicious. Those are the things that challenge me and my thought process at my age. 
Im introduced to this world now. Thanks to people like Snyder, Scarlett Johansson, Jlaw, etc. I will be big fan of Xmen movies next year. Aquaman, venom, yes, I'll be around for those. I'll even go back to see justice once or twice more. Cause I'm a fan of Snyder, and it's my responsibility to support. Its floggers, oops, I mean vloggers responsibility to give informed reviews, not to just bash and bash and bash. That's how I feel.",-0.793,405

"rainbowman6 Suicide  Squad was a piece of shit! Wonder Woman had a plot, likeable characters, a great historically educational background with WW1, a very charismatic lead and great supporting actors! Who cares if there was an inconsequential drop in the box office! Wonder Woman was still a big hit and was alot better then that low brow geared David Ayer mess!",0.811,69

rugged english I don't know what you're  trying to say. Are you blaming them? Or not?,-0.5514,19
rugged english somewhat. But I am a comic book fan who grew up on the cartoon shows but I also love movies. I don't think it was the critics to blame. BVS for a lot of people was all over the place. It had a ton of issues and so did Suicide squad. I honestly think it was just fans saying they don't want the same type of mediocrity. I havnt gone to see Justice leauge and I plan to wait to rent it for a buck. I also like Zack Snyder and enjoyed man of steel. But he had to much to cover in BVS and honestly I think it's WB to blame for everything. They were rushing everything. The critics are not to blame.,0.7506,137

thank you John. I've been arguing online all day for why the movie underperformed. And critics is not the main reason. The general audience are not fans of Zack's DC universe. BvS and Suicide are not good movies. Comic fans may like them.  the general audience not so much. and that's how these movies make a killing. when the general audience likes them as well,-0.8227,73

"this is a little embarrassing but I saw the trailer for Ready Player One not knowing it's this big franchise crossover thing, and I didn't pick up on that AT ALL watching the trailer. the only reference I recognized is The Iron Giant, and again not knowing what this movie is, my reaction was ""this is such a blatant rip off of the Iron Giant design!"". totally didn't spot the rest of the other franchise characters popping up there. than I watched all the trailer breakdowns and felt like a dumbass.",-0.0889,101

"when you say ""10%"" that varies... a movie like JL would have had a much bigger impact from critic rating due to  the track record of DC... people have been split on most the films so i feel a lot more people would have checked out reviews before spending $$.... did it break the movie? no... but i think we are talking more around 25% maybe even more.",0.0516,79
"whoever wrote that JL question straight up lied! ive seen those colleagues speak about it, did they say the critical response is partially to blame? yes (& it is lets not play dumb and act like critics dont have an influence) but nobody EVER said solely. that reader chose what he wanted to hear and pushed a narrative that like ""fans cant accept it and theyre blaming it all on critics"" no thats not what was said by any of his former colleagues. lying motherfucker",-0.9722,94
