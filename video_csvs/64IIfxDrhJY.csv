"Preston Swooper Actually the movie is extremely  accurate and I myself have met descendants of those lost and those who survived and James Cameron himself. The family members gave their approval of this movie. Cameron has done much more for the remembrance of Titanic than anyone. (excluding the Titanic Historical Society) James, Leo and Kate all gave alot to survivors and helped them financially. You went to the theatre just like everyone else except you (and many others) didn't realize that 3/4 of the stories in the script were about real people and their true stories. James has honored their memory many, many times and has sat down with numerous family members of Titanic's passengers himself. I'm so sick of people thinking that his only reason for making this film was for money. These are people who are out of the loop, obviously. James admitted that at first he just wanted to make the movie. But when he took his first dive to the wreck site, it became so much more for him.",0.755,191
