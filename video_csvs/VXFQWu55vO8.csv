"The Evolve boards blow the boosted board away on all fronts.  I have the Evolve Carbon and it is amazing.  28mph top speed for me at 230lbs, and 20-30 mile range at my weight.  It carves well because of the trucks and is has an all terrain option.  More expensive but worth it. The larger street wheels make bumps in NYC feel like they do not exist.  I just need to get the r2 remote because their r1 remote fails compared to boosted.",0.864,91
The Meepo 1.5 board is apparently comparable to the boosted board and is only $419 and it comes in a normal & small size you should try it.,0.3612,30
"The Rx0 looks amazing, its vision is a tiny bit more narrow, but it actually looks better that way. Please explain what the problem is with the GoPro, which you describe that it looks ""like a GoPro"" (duh). I wish I could get a Booster board here in Spain...!",0.9223,60
"The only thing different I really see with the cameras is the lenses. GoPro using a wide angle,e lens, Sony not so much. But they do both use the Sony IMX sensors band of sensors. Theirs a lot of IMX types of sensors, all great sensors. But the one you use isn‚Äôt the only factor, the lens, the hardware. I have one in my microscope camera that can technically do 120FPS, but the hardware and firmware from the camera manufacturer doesn‚Äôt support all the sensors ability. From the DJI Mavic, Spark, microscope camera, Three GoPro 4‚Äôs (one is a 4 Black), and the GoPro 5 that I tested and returned. The difference can be huge even with the same sensor if the hardware can not take advantage of all the sensors ability. 
So mostly the price cost different is the supporting hardware and firmware to control that hardware. Maybe I‚Äôll try the Sony next some day?",0.9586,187
"The quality looks legit, and I agree with you about the ""gopro"" look. As a gopro user I use protune and now fix it in post and have been very happy with results. I was wondering if the rx0 can go wider? I use my gopro for bmx and like the fisheye look! :)",0.9059,61
"The reason that Acton and Riptide feel similar and that boosted feels so smooth is that Acton and Ripetide USE THE SAME ESC. (the brains of the skateboard, controls the motors, etc.). It's a cheap chinese non-adjustable esc, unlike the boosted ESC which is custom made and programmed by boosted for perfect control. That's the difference between boosted and others.",0.9136,70

While I am genuinely impressed by the quality of the RX0 (you‚Äôre absolutely right in that it looks way better than the GoPros) but it isn‚Äôt quite up there with the RX100V or even the A7s. Those (esp. the RX100V) just look much smoother.,0.4588,55
