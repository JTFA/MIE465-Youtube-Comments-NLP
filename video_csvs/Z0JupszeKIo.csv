I love how people post these kinds of comments, but when other people say there's a conspiracy for a global goverment ""planetly goverment"". People just laugh at them and call them conspiracy theorists.

"Tyler Wright 
1st. That isn't true. Republicans don't have a super majority in the Senate, you need 60 votes in the Senate to pass major legislation. Republicans don't have control of the Senate.. 2nd. Even if every Republican agreed we still wouldn't have enough votes to pass a bill. Your wrong. 3rd. DACA will not be funded until we end chain migration, end the visa lottery system, and full funding of the border wall. Trump hasn't changed his stance on this. It's funny how you say you're neither a Republican or Democrat, but you completely blame the Republicans, you're definitely not biased, lol.

If Democrats don't want to compromise then we can just deport all the DACA recipients back to their origin country once DACA fails in March. Then maybe Democrats will want to work with us.

Why do democrats always like to see the world burn? First Hillary Clinton tried to rig the election (was caught via the Wiki Leak emails colluding with the DNC to take down Bernie Sanders) and after they get caught they make up this entire Russian collusion narrative to pass the blame. It's pretty funny how dumb they think the average American is. They knew that the average person's attention span is so little that they would completely forget that THEY (the democrats) were the ones who were really rigging the election! They are so angry that their rigging didn't work now they have to shutdown the government because Republicans won't take their black mail bait (you must enforce policies that we demand or we will shutdown the government). Democrats are pretty much acting like terrorists at this point.,-0.8328,150

"You know, 51 seats is still a majority. All you have to do is convince 9 of the democrats or the independents. Yet no one representing the left (or moderate in the case of the independents/third party, idk what they call themselves) voted for this side because it excluded their sides point of view entirely. This is the problem with American government the past 20ish years. Whatever party is in control acts like a child in a toy store ""i want this, i want that, no you can't have that i want this!"" both the parties have been focusing on political wins and repealing other parties policies, than they are at making decisions with the interest of the whole country. The power of the majority corrupts a party to its core, and then the other side will play victim like they've never done it before. This time it was the republicans be obnoxious. Soon enough it will be the democrats. We all just need to start realizing that the ""other side"" isn't there for us to demonize, but that they are also americans with different ideas, no matter what anyone tries to say they're still your brothers.",0.7088,223
