"I'm not entirely sold just yet. Suppose that, in an effort to reduce high speed accidents, we throw out some old regulations (speed limits, yield signs, etc.) and we instead introduce a new safety measure to highways. This measure is to install lava pits of death on either side of the road. Shortly after these lava pits of death are completed, accident rates plummet! Everyone is now driving more slowly and with greater caution due to the recently added risk of running off the road into a lava pit of death. However, drivers soon become accustomed to this new measure. After a while (perhaps years) highway speeds return to the way they were prior to the introduction of our new road safety invention. Everything is back to the way it once was... but with increased danger in the form of lava pits of death.

At the end of the day though if the data demonstrates that a shared space design for a particular area is the most effective at decreasing transit times, accidents, delays, and morbidity then that is what we should do regardless of how it makes us feel. If anyone says we should do it any other way because it makes them feel better then what they are really saying is they would rather everyone have longer travel times and be injured or die just so they can feel better during the tiny portion of their lives they spend at this location. This is clearly an immoral position so why are we even considering their opinion in policy making?

Not to sound dispassionate but we cannot design everything in the world to meet the needs of the tiny minority of disabled people. We can and should make the adjustments that sacrifice the least for the most gain for the disabled as this would be a net gain. However, there comes a point where it is infeasible to ask for greater sacrifices. That said the shared space concept has not been implemented for very long in the west and there are sure to be innovations that will help disabled people in the future; like robotic assistants or automated vehicles.

Tunnels would work better, but then you have to account for the weight of traffic above the tunnel, which may well include big rigs. Easier engineering scenario, but may still result in a less efficient travel path. Probably could incorporate elevators in either design to minimize walking distance and reduce materials cost.",0.9602,141

This is an interesting video. Something that could be done is the city hire crossing guards dependent on the number people with disabilities that cross in that area. This allows them to help those with disabilities to still cross. If you have a city with a hundred disabled people having to cross everyday then you could figure out a way to have enough crossing guards around the clock to be on handle at any given time. Something like 2 or 3 crossing guards per shift would typically be enough to help cross to each side. You won't see a shared space type intersection in big cities such as New York or Los Angeles as the congestion would be horrible for the amount of vehicles that travel the roads there. Now in smaller cities say 100k or less I could see this as being possible. Now I say crossing guard but they wouldn't exactly stop traffic to escort someone to the other side.

But honestly it requires more thought regardless, theres also the issue with how a blind person cant react well to conflicts of movement, like waiting for a car to pass or speeding up a bit to let a car maintain its speed.

Clearly the system is helping much more people than it is hurting, and thats only mentioning accidents, it is also much better for overall traffic flow and convenience.

It is always a sad thing for someone to be hurt or die in an accident, but to answer that lady, if the traffic lights had been there then maybe that blind person would have been only a small part of the people hurt crossing that street.",-0.9895,259
"Was he more likely to get hit, or is she blaming it on that because ""it's the most recent change to the area so it must be the problem""? 

I ask because if it wasn't changed the person may have still been killed, maybe sooner, maybe later. With a subject, so complex it's jumping the gun to quickly make black and white statements like ""I'm sure if the traffic lights where there, this wouldn't have happened"".

It -Did- happen though so investigation and research -Needs- to be done on the safety of these compared to conventional intersections.

Shared space or not, maybe we should look into technology to enhance the disabled's ability to know and react to what's in their surroundings. A device that detects vehicles and convey this info to a blind user would be quite helpful if it can be made to work reliably.",0.1513,166

"What's being blatantly overlooked here is that people (especially drivers) in unmarked intersections are more careful and less prone to causing or being victims of accidents because SUCH INTERSECTIONS AREN'T THE NORM FOR THEM! They feel uneasy in an unfamiliar environment; it's only natural they'll be more careful. Should unmarked roads become norm, people will get used to them, and will be at least as reckless as they are now.",-0.6131,78

"well, add things that we have accepted as normal, such as walking while looking at your smartphone for example, and shared space design (with revisions) will start to make more sense. In currently implemented design, people often don't pay enough attention where they are walking or to where they are walking. This lead to accidents happening. If shared space design (with revisions) is implemented, I think people will be ""forced"" to pay attention so they don't get into accident while walking (except for the visually impaired, that is). This might work out better than people walking down the street while looking at their phone and just miss the lines between roads and foot paths, leading to people making their way into traffic while distracted by their phone and causing an accident.",0.8834,151
