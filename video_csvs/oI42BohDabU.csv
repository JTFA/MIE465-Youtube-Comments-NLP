"When i hear i kissed a girl i always imagine a teenager at a big crazy party, the kind where people are hooking up all around you. I imagine she's buzzed and loose and just goes for it with a girl she's been chilling out with. It makes me think of being young and free and experimenting with yourself and your feelings and just living in the way that only teenagers really seem to do. Things have changed but i don't think that song will ever stop being iconic. 
It also makes me never wanna buy anything other than cherry chapstick, or cupcake.",0.2023,110
