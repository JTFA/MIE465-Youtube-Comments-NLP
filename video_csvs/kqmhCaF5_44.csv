"Actually “Christmas” is a European pagan festival called Yuletide. Christians hijacked it by name only. Hail Woden, fuck Jesus the middle eastern Jew boy 😆",0.0,30
"Actually, Jesus was born sometime in July. Read your own holy book and study its history. ""Christmas"" is actually a celebration of the winter solstice. Us atheists know much more about your traditions than you do.",0.0,43
"Actually, Jesus would have been born sometime in Spring, late March through April.  The Bible clearly says, ""While shepherds watched their flocks by night"".  And the only time shepherds watched their flocks at night time was during the birthing season, Spring time,  to protect mothers and newborns.  There is also a Pagan holiday for the winter solstice, but it wasn't called ""Christmas"".  And Yuletide also celebrates something different from what Christmas celebrates.  Those are not the same thing.  Christmas is not a celebration of winter solstice.  Christmas is the replacement for the celebration of winter solstice.  Study history.",0.9393,117

Darth Wiffy you’ve been terribly misinformed. And they were brought up in a very religious household and seem to continue their faith without being preachy. The only thing scandalous about them is 2 of the 3 of them got their wives pregnant before they were married which isn’t a big deal in this day and age.,-0.7783,63

"No, Yuletide is a Pagan European festival.  Christmas is not Yuletide because they celebrate two very distinct things.  I will agree that Christians did ""hijack"" the winter solstice festival and place the celebration of the birth of Jesus in its place.  Jesus, clearly, was not born in December.",0.9201,57

"Sorry Michael, It doesn't matter what you think you're celebrating, if you're putting up fir trees, mistletoe, Holly and Ivy, lights, giving gifts, eating yule logs, wreath on the door etc etc and most other traditions, you're continuing the Pagan festival without you even knowing it. It would be like a pagan celebrating during an old jewish holiday with a Hannukah lamp in the window and saying the celebration has nothing to do with Judaism.",0.9503,86
