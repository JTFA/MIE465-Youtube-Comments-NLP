Jordin would have had 12 perfect scores and still had the record. So if you wanna say it's not fair their favorite dance was scored, it was unfair to almost every season that len wasn't there for almost the entire season 23 and all of season 21, there were an unbelievable # of perfect scores given those seasons.",0.7196,103

Jordan is definitely the best male contestant to ever compete on DWTS and his 9 perfect scores, which are the most perfect scores from a contestant on DWTS, shows just how amazing he is. When he dances, it’s as if he’s gliding through the floor like a figure skater and his lines are so clean like a ballerina. He is an absolute legend and star! Now that he’s won, I can watch all of his dances over and over again, knowing that all of his immense dancing talent and hard work paid off in the end...",0.9939,148

Laurie had 8 perfect scores. Jordan would have 8 too. He wouldn't be at the top.

RDK f  fm,0.0,3
"Reasons he won:
1) Everybody loves a comeback story.
2) He's black. Only a racist would vote against the black kid, right?
3) Hamilton. Need I say more?
3) He actually does have lot's of talent, but it comes from an unfair advantage as he is basically a professional dancer. Not exactly fair to the other Stars, who had truly learned all their dance skills on this show.


Mark and Lindsey ought to have won.",0.9282,91

Starlight Bliss rigged,0.296,3
"Technically it could have been better (he didn't straight the legs, his  foot pressure into the floor was weak), but his artistry, his musicality and his quality of movement was fantastic. Samba is the hardest Latin-American dance, it wasn't astonishing but it was a great try. An 8.",0.9112,57
That's because they scored him when he did the favorite dance of the season. They have never done that before. Otherwise Laurie would have 9 perfect scores as well,0.8316,31
