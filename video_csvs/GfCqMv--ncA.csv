Enjoy and sub to me!

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with

Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch in the way that you bringing me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day, for the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We are running out of time

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I, I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time
