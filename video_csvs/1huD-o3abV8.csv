"""Zawaideh accused White of repeated sexual harassment and forcing his 
authoritarian management style on her. The suit claimed White has sent 
sexually explicit and graphic images of erect penises to Zawaideh, and 
that he had “forced her to watch sexually disturbing videos, including 
videos sexualizing human fecal matter, and made vulgar sexual remarks to
 her.” It also alleged that White had used his position as founder and 
financier of Bad Things to “impose a strict regime over Zawaideh, going 
so far as to demand that she cut her hair, wear sexually revealing 
clothes and underwear, and refrain from wearing red lipstick — her own 
personal signature.”

- In case you're wondering what's going on. Shaun White might act like a dick, he did settle for the lawsuit. But why would she stay in the band for years? What about kicking him in the balls and leave the band? Or if I was her boyfriend and the guitarist said she should suck balls, I'd beat the shit out of him no matter who he is. But let me guess, it's worth staying and playing along. He's famous. I'm getting a bit more cynical about the world today.",-0.9549,221

"From a  former fan of Shaun White:




Somebody should take this athlete  to task on his disrespectful behavior to our stars & stripes during Olympics games. .
It’s unlikely this kid ever served his country or was  a patriot for single day. He uses our stars and stripes for window dressing...photographs, marketing and promotional $$ opportunities
When not using flag for promos, Shaun dropped  our flag on the snowy deck then  dragged  our national ensign behind him like a little kid with a baby blanket.
Bringing a disgrace to his Olympic achievements and  our country.
Sean is obviously very wealthy, this spoiled lad needs to take some of his considerable  income and dedicated to US veterans causes.
As well as offer an apology for his  behavior with our flag on international television.  Perhaps if he ever served our country in the military he'd appreciate the flag.   No doubt there was no recruiter in San Diego where he failed to gow  up.

I thought the case had already gone to court and was settled.  So CNN in order to make more news on some one that has done something has decided to dig this back up.  You want to know why they did not take CNN's questions?  It's because it is old news and it has already been dealt with.  You don't see CNN pushing questions about the women and gay athlete's sexual pasts.  You don't have them pushing the questions about sex in Olympic village.  That doesn't further their political agenda of putting Hillary on the 2020 Democratic Presidential ticket.  Which is what this is all really about.

"Well, he said that we must pack up and move at once to Battle Creek. I asked his reasons, and he responded, “To give this message that the judgment has begun upon the living.” I answered him, “The work which the Lord has given us to do is not yet finished. When our work here is completed we are sure the Lord will let us know that it is time for us to move to Battle Creek, instead of teaching you our duty”.... I left him for Brother Starr to talk with further while I resumed my writing. LDE 21.3
He told Brother Starr that when Sister White spoke to him so kindly, and yet with such authority, he began to see that he had made a mistake, that the impressions which had moved him so strongly were not consistent or reasonable. Although our family is large, consisting of ten members, besides three visitors, we decided to have this young man stay with us for a time. We dare not have him go with people who will treat him harshly and condemn him, neither do we want him to repeat his “revelations.” We will have him remain for a little time where we can associate with him and if possible lead him in safe, sure paths.—Letter 66, 1894. LDE 22.1
Gluttony and Intemperance LDE 22
Gluttony and intemperance lie at the foundation of the great moral depravity in our world. Satan is aware of this and he is constantly tempting men and women to indulge the taste at the expense of health and even life itself. Eating, drinking, and dressing are made the aim of life with the world. Just such a state of things existed before the Flood. And this state of dissipation is one of the marked evidences of the soon close of this earth's history.—Letter 34, 1875. LDE 22.2
The picture which Inspiration has given of the antediluvian world represents too truly the condition to which modern society is fast hastening.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 102 (1890). LDE 22.3
We know that the Lord is coming very soon. The world is fast becoming as it was in the days of Noah. It is given over to selfish indulgence. Eating and drinking are carried to excess. Men are drinking the poisonous liquor that makes them mad.—Letter 308, 1907. LDE 23.1
Deeds of Violence LDE 23
In the days of Noah the overwhelming majority was opposed to the truth, and enamored with a tissue of falsehoods. The land was filled with violence. War, crime, murder, was the order of the day. Just so will it be before Christ's second coming.—The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 1:1090 (1891). LDE 23.2
The labor unions are quickly stirred to violence if their demands are not complied with. Plainer and plainer is it becoming that the inhabitants of the world are not in harmony with God. No scientific theory can explain the steady march of evil workers under the generalship of Satan. In every mob wicked angels are at work, rousing men to commit deeds of violence.... LDE 23.3
The perversity and cruelty of men will reach such a height that God will reveal Himself in His majesty. Very soon the wickedness of the world will have reached its limit and, as in the days of Noah, God will pour out His judgments.—The Upward Look, 334 (1903). LDE 23.4
The terrible reports we hear of murders and robberies, of railway accidents and deeds of violence, tell the story that the end of all things is at hand. Now, just now, we need to be preparing for the Lord's second coming.—Letter 308, 1907. LDE 23.5
Wars and Disasters LDE 24
The tempest is coming and we must get ready for its fury by having repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord will arise to shake terribly the earth. We shall see troubles on all sides. Thousands of ships will be hurled into the depths of the sea. Navies will go down, and human lives will be sacrificed by millions. Fires will break out unexpectedly and no human effort will be able to quench them. The palaces of earth will be swept away in the fury of the flames. Disasters by rail will become more and more frequent. Confusion, collision, and death without a moment's warning will occur on the great lines of travel. The end is near, probation is closing. Oh, let us seek God while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near!—Messages to Young People, 89, 90 (1890). LDE 24.1",-0.9959,888

"i send a message to the Olympic committee as far as a solution to the Shaun White walking on the flag backlash. First---Shaun admits ""he messed up""  Then the Olympic committee release a statement. ""the Olympic committee regrets the unintentional and unfortunate occurrence with the flag after the win. He was given a huge flag while he was struggling holding his snowboard and in the heat of the moment it was dragged and stepped on. We ask that the public forgive him and we have changed our protocol to a smaller flag--as well as that after the flag photo op--it be carried by his helpers or a Olympic representative especially in cases where the winner is struggling with equipment possibly in a snow and or windy condition"" I think this is a wise solution that would allow everyone to ""forgive and forget""--AND TO GIVE CLOSURE. If the Olympics give no such defence his win and legacy will forever be virtually ruined except among a tiny circle of snowboard people. With the flag occurrence the win WAS ALSO STOLEN FROM THE PUBLIC.",0.9212,197

"it took her four years to realize she's getting sexually harassed?if i was her,i'll be murdering Shaun by sticking drumsticks in every hole of his body on the very first day he's acting perversely towards me.my brother said that if you're the only female member of a band dominated by males,chances are high they'll treat you as a male.it depends on how you'll handle things,you either act as their Mom,their elder or younger sister and they'll treat and respect you as how you want them to.
since Shaun White owns the band he has all the right to image packaging.outfits,image and such",0.0772,115
