"Lemon doesn't just contain citric acid, that said, why don't you start with clarified lemon juice, it's trivially simple to make at home, especially since its heat stable (unlike lime juice).

All you would need would be about 2-3g of agar (0.2% total weight of juice (NOT ML), since the final yield is about 20-25% less than the start, probably want to start with 1.5k of juice and 3g agar), lemon juice (strained), a cheesecloth (a real one), a coffee filter (Chemex works really well for this), and I think that's about it.

You would disperse the agar in the strained lemon juice, bring that to a boil for a couple of minutes to hydrate the agar, take it off, pour in a large, relatively shallow dish (increase the surface area) and chill it to room temp at which point the agar gel will set to a very very loose state, which is exactly what you want. You would break that up with a whisk, kind of like cheese curd, you want to brake that up into a soupy but mess with relatively small chunks, and put it into a cheesecloth folded over a couple of times (real cheesecloth, not the supermarket stuff), and gently massage the clarified juice out of the gel (don't squeeze too hard, don't twist too hard, it will be tempting), once that kind of stops producing you can unwind your cloth a bit and mix the stuff on the inside, which should give you more liquid, do a few times to get most of the juice out. When you are done with that, put the resulting liquid through a coffee filter, especially if you have a Chemex pot, but that is really to catch any little bits of the gel that could have made it through the cloth, and you should have a relatively clear lemon juice (go ahead, try it, it's lemon juice, it confuses heck out of people).

Or improved process (time-wise), disperse 2g of agar in 350g of lemon juice, boil that, reserve the remaining 650g of juice as cold put it in the fridge, when the agar mixture is hydrated, you can mix the hot and cold lemon juices (note: you want to keep them above 35C and let them set), and voila, now you don't have to wait as much time, add an ice bath, and now it takes just minutes to set.

Note, you can clarify other juices this way, but not all juices will work, but lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, they will all do fine. You just have to be careful with lime juice as it's not really good when heated, so you want to hydrate agar in water before mixing it with the juice, somewhere around 20-25% of water will be needed of the total desired weight, to 0.2% (again of total desired weight) of agar, it will still taste fine though... Oh you mentioned carbonating stuff, try it with the clarified orange or grapefruit juice (you may need to figure out sugar content, so please do experiment), it may make you a party favorite.",0.976,617
