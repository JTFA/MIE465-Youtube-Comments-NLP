"What got her there in the first place? Some become homeless over medical reasons who can not live in public housing due to the take over of gangs. Or they are stalked by someone who hurt them and they are traumatized and hiding out, or....the list is endless. But the housing system that is supposed to help people like her are full of convicts and their families. And a single woman would not be accepted into the government housing system due to her looks, not being a drug addict or willing to become a gang member, so she much live under a bridge, out of a car on the move, with relatives and friends until that wears out and finally in a tent. I see how it could happen. The first step is fixing why she can't get assistance and live in government housing. I think there need to be women only housing for the abused and disabled. The homeless who were gang stalked are too afraid to tell anybody because they threaten them that they will come back and get them.

I've had my share of encounters with alcoholics and addicts - very little compassion for habitual substance abusers who refuse to change  - but the people forced into homelessness don't deserve to be forgotten simply because they have to share the streets with those who've turned their back on society.",-0.9611,155
