Also, the videos are perfect, it's nice to watch, re-watch and show to friends. Exceptional quality of every detail. I realize I'm not some famous critic or anything, jut wanted to leave a positive comment here, coz Mania (and this song  especially) made me feel a lot. It's best I've heard of nowadays music.Thank you.",0.9358,122

I think FOB genuinely have a variety of musical interests and tastes - from R&B to hard rock. They've said that in interviews over the years. I think they want to be able to show that variety on records. Unfortunately a lot of fans aren't interested in musical variety. But that's on those fans I think.,-0.4133,63
I think fall out boy is the best band ever,0.6369,10
"I understand that, but they have always had a bit more of a harder background than they do now. They used to be more heavier. Even if it was just the slightest bit. I honestly still respect them now, though. I will always have respect for their change and their different ways. Peace be with you, Erline Andrews.",0.9587,67

I never really feel a thing
I'm just kinda too frozen
You were the only one
That even kinda came close
I just pinch myself
No longer comatose
I woke up, no luck
I woke up, no luck
And when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
I got too high again
Realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend
I love you to death
But I just can't, I just can't pretend
We weren't lovers first
Confidants but never friends
Were we ever friends?
But when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Hold me tight, or don't
'Cause I'm past the limits
The distance between us
It sharpens me like a knife
Past the limits
The distance between us
It sharpens me like a knife
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
I'm pretty sure that this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
