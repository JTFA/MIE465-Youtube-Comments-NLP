The information (in the memos that have been released) is from the FBI, DOJ and has gone through Congress, National Security. That's the memos. The corresponding text messages are out of the IG's office. I know the President mentioned he likes watching Fox and Friends and tweeted their stuff a few times. So yeah I thought it could be really funny to have Fox and Friends overexaggerated (that is why I clicked on it) as I could imagine a storyline, but this is not good-natured humor; it's over the line into disbarraging our government and using mind games. Fox and Friends is one of the very few shows that IS bias against the Left/Global-government supporters so it is no surprise his affinity for it. I don't know to what specific advice from the administration the president didn't take, but the people didn't elect the administration (not all have been winners). Muellar has charged Flynn and Maniford..Flynn was caught on phone tap in a lie about talking about sanctions to a Russian Ambassador [as the incoming Nat. Security Chief],  and Maniford and another one were charged with stuff unrelated to the claims about collusion. There was a 4th one charged with money laundering that he has pleaded not guilty on.
