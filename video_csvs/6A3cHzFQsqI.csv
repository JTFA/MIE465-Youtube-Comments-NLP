"They're descended from English cattle rustling peasants,
And police horses hate them too

They built half the country as we know it,
With plenty of breaks for chips,
Then spent their entire wages on buckfast,
Tried to swing a punch but slipped and fell on their faces like dumbshits

They smashed bottles on cops face,
They marched up and down in bowler hats,
They conjoin words so you ones becomes ""youse""
Then complain the media make them look like fools,

They are not very efficient,
They are soapbar smoking,
They are reformation sprung,
Still waiting for the rest of the island to turn red white and blue

They hate the catholics the polish and the blacks too,
They use mini mars bars wrappers for birth control,
They are invulnerable to cool,
And the rest of the world hates them too
