"Charley Turner Get it in your imagination instead of putting a sin onto you permanently. Your body isn’t a canvas. Also scientific, your cells constantly die and new ones come into their place, and those new ones are stronger than the last. When you get a tattoo, the ink weakens the cellular regeneration in that area, making it weaker than the rest of your body and prone to disease.",-0.8779,79

I had both my calves (i dont know if thats how you spell it but I mean the back of my lower legs hahahah) tattooed and I share your opinion. Omg the pain was horrendous! But also the healing took longer than all my other tattoos. Maybe because the skin is much dryer on the legs. Thank god the backs are done.

It hurt so bad, but I love it, so I suppose it was worth it!

I have quiet sensitive skin and a couple of times me shaving the area has caused pretty bad irritation and made the tattoo very painful and then take longer to heal. So to play it safe I just have them shave the area and some artists might not shave it’s all preference but don’t feel ashamed if you go with hairy legs or super hairy arms.

Just has my leg done too. This hurts so bad! 😂 have you heard of dermalise? My partner is a tattoo artist so whenever he does a new one for me I use dermalize to heal it.

Protects it from infections and keeps it’s moisturised all while healing as the material is breathable. Cuts healing time in half! Love the style of filming in this btw 😘,-0.6218,99

Its tasteless and puts you in lower class society for life. I dont tell this to people with tattoos though because I feel really bad for them.

Yeah if it’s your legs I’d probably shave the day before save the tattooist a job. When I’ve had arm tattoos they’ve shaved it for me. Whilst the tattoo is initially healing don’t shave for the first two weeks or so until it’s not longer dry or peeling/ scabby.,0.6597,65
