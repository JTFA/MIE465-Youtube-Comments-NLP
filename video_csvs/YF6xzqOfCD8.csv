"Funny story: my balcony has successfully caught a bird.  It was a bit bigger than a cuckoo, though.  It was a Red Tailed Hawk, if memory serves (certainly some similarly large raptor).  The gap between the house and the railing is about 3 feet wide, so it couldn't take off on a route parallel to the house because its wingspan is ever so slightly more, and it couldn't take off perpendicular to the house because it's a bird, not a helicopter; bird wings aren't built for vertical takeoffs.  (Well, not usually.  I'm not going to argue that no bird can do a vertical takeoff, just that this increasingly alarmed raptor couldn't.)

Once we figured out what was going on, my dad went out onto the balcony and boosted it up level with the railing, and it was gone.  Seemed to be flying just fine, so it hadn't done itself an injury.

Point being, if you build a wall around a bird that's high enough and tight enough, you can indeed capture the bird.",0.6169,200

"Reminds me of the stories the people of Devizes in Wiltshire, used to tell about the inhabitants of the nearby village of Bishops Cannings.

Most famously, of course, the tale of the Moonrakers, who were caught by the revenue men trying to rake some barrels of contraband brandy out of the local pond, the Crammer. When asked what they were doing they pointed to the reflection of the full moon, and told the customs men that they were trying to rake a big old cheese out of the pond.

Probably apocryphal, but one that is definitely true is the tale of the Bishop Cannings marching band base drum. The drummer decided to build a new drum in his front bedroom, but then found that is was too big for him to get it out of the house. The band were thus reduced to marching up  and down the street outside his house as he stood at the window beating out time. The drum still exists, and was in Devizes Museum last time I went there.

Less likely to be true is the tale of the church spires. Bishops Cannings Church has a mighty fine spire and a tiny one in the corner next to it housing the circular staircase. The story goes that one of the churchwardens wanted to grow the little spire to be as big as the main one, so he hauled a young calf up to the top of the tower in the hope that its manure would cause the little spire to grow. Every day he would take hay up to the top of the tower, and spread the manure round the base of the small spire. Of course it didn't grow, but the cow did, and soon there was no way to get it back down. The cow apparently lived out the rest of its life up there, and grass started growing all round the base of the spire.",0.9398,351

"Yeah, verdatum completely missed the point.  It had nothing to do with royalty or royal blood or any sort of god-given mischief, it was down to the fact that if you have prestigious visitors of any sort you need to pay a lot of money to ""pretty up"" the place as someone stated above.

The Brazilian government wanted to hold the Olympics in Rio but no Brazilians wanted it held there because they could think of one hundred better things that 10 billion dollars could be spent on.",0.228,95
