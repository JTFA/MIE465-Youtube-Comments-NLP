His niece and nephew are Republicans.  That's got to say something.,0.0,13
"I would like to say something here. As someone who lived through this time in history, and who, as a child growing up in DC had the privilege of seeing his historic ""I have a dream"" speech, I can say that there's some historic misperceptions. Even until 1973 there were ""whites only"" counters in diners and signs on water fountains. Some of which were in the Senate building. I know because we saw them on field trips when I was in High School.  My HS was one of the first to integrate. But that didn't stop bigotry and this notion that bigotry only took place in the south is historically inaccurate. Bigotry went on up north as well, except northerners were more subtle.

I would also like to point out that it was democrats, not the republicans, who opposed integration.  Robert Bird was a grand dragon in the KKK and everyone knew it.  And even though JFK and Bobby led the fight to end segregation, their party opposed their views.

The DC area had a large black population. Some was slummy, most was not. There were very good stores and shops and my Mom used to take us kids to a shoe store owned by a black man who was so very kind and always a gentleman.  When the DC riots broke out, the protesters tore up his shop, stole the shoes, and left his business in ruins. He was not alone. The butchers shop was demolished as was a television and radio repair shop we used to go to and other stores.

I wonder what Dr. King would be thinking now about his community. Did he fight for them to be able to pull the same shenanigans seen in third world countries? Or did he fight for the dignity of blacks?

My family is multiracial. So maybe my view is skewed. But when I hear anyone of any race say they cannot achieve a goal today because of their skin color, I have to wonder what they think Dr. King would think of that? It's an excuse, not a reason.
